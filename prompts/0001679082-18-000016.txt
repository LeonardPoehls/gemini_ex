Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for the treatment women’s health and endocrine diseases. Our goal is to be the leading global biopharmaceutical company focused on treating women’s health and endocrine diseases in areas of high unmet medical need. Our lead product candidate is relugolix, an oral, once-daily, small molecule that acts as a gonadotropin-releasing hormone, or GnRH, receptor antagonist. We are advancing relugolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, endometriosis-associated pain, and advanced prostate cancer. In addition, we are developing MVT-602, an oligopeptide kisspeptin agonist, for the treatment of female infertility as part of the hormonal preparation used in assisted reproduction. Both relugolix and MVT-602 were licensed to us by Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG, or Takeda. 
Relugolix
We are currently developing relugolix in three target indications: heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, endometriosis-associated pain, and advanced prostate cancer. Relugolix is an oral, once-daily, small molecule that acts as a GnRH receptor antagonist that binds to and inhibits GnRH receptors in the anterior pituitary gland. Inhibition of GnRH receptors decreases the release of gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone), thereby decreasing the downstream production of estrogen and progesterone by the ovaries in women and testosterone by the testes in men. 
As a GnRH receptor antagonist, relugolix has a clinically- validated mechanism of action in each of our three target indications. Lowering estrogen levels decreases heavy menstrual bleeding in women with uterine fibroids and improves the pelvic pain associated with endometriosis. Decreasing testosterone slows the growth and progression of advanced prostate cancer and is the central objective of treatment in men with advanced prostate cancer or when the disease has recurred following prostatectomy or radiation therapy. Injectable GnRH agonists are currently approved to treat uterine fibroids, endometriosis, and prostate cancer, and an injectable GnRH antagonist is approved to treat men with prostate cancer.
In our clinical programs for our target women’s health indications, a maximally estrogen-suppressive dose of relugolix (40 mg) is co-administered orally, once daily with low-dose estradiol and progestin add-back therapy. The goal of this add-back therapy is to minimize side-effects typically associated with low estrogen levels (such as bone mineral density loss and hot flashes) while maximizing the benefit of low estrogen levels on symptoms of uterine fibroids and endometriosis. We intend to commercialize relugolix, if approved, in our target women’s health indications as a fixed-dose combination product, which is a once-daily single pill containing both relugolix and low-dose estradiol and progestin. The low-dose estradiol and progestin we intend to use consists of estradiol (1.0 mg) and norethindrone acetate, or NETA, (0.5 mg) and is a formulation currently approved for use to lower the side effect of bone mineral density loss and reduce vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) in postmenopausal women. We believe relugolix with low-dose hormonal add-back therapy has the potential to have a better safety and tolerability profile than the currently approved GnRH therapies and has the potential to be used longer-term. The goal of this longer-term treatment is to provide women with uterine fibroids and endometriosis a medical alternative to hysterectomy and other invasive procedures often recommended to treat these conditions. In our clinical program for men with advanced prostate cancer, a maximally testosterone-suppressive dose of relugolix (120 mg) is administered orally, once daily. We believe relugolix has a well-defined safety profile, based on its evaluation in more than 1,600 study participants to date, in Phase 1 and multiple large, randomized Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, including at doses of 120 mg/day administered to men for more than one year. In these trials, relugolix has been shown to be generally well tolerated and to suppress estrogen and progesterone levels in women and testosterone levels in men. Common side effects observed were consistent with suppression of these hormones.

Uterine Fibroids
Uterine fibroids are noncancerous tumors composed of smooth muscle and fibrous connective tissue that develop in or on the walls of the uterus. In addition to an individual’s genetic predisposition, estrogens are well known to play an important role in the regulation of fibroid growth. Although uterine fibroids are benign tumors that are often asymptomatic, they can cause debilitating symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding, heavy or painful periods, anemia, abdominal pain, backache, increased abdominal girth and bloating, urinary frequency or retention, constipation or painful defecation, pregnancy loss, painful intercourse and, in some cases, infertility. These symptoms can also lead to loss of productivity at work, limitations in normal activities of daily living, and social embarrassment.
Uterine fibroids are among the most common reproductive tract tumors in women. We estimate approximately 5 million women in the United States, or U.S., suffer from symptoms of uterine fibroids, approximately 3 million of whom are inadequately treated by current medical therapy and require further treatment. 
The current approach to treating uterine fibroids includes both medical and surgical options. The recommended treatment for a given patient is dependent on factors such as the patient’s desire to become pregnant in the future, the importance of uterine preservation, symptom severity, and tumor characteristics. Medical options include oral contraceptives, tranexamic acid, and GnRH agonists. The current standard of care for the treatment of patients with mild symptoms includes the use of oral contraceptives or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, which are generally prescribed at the time of initial diagnosis. These therapeutic options, however, often do not provide sufficient relief to the many patients with more moderate-to-severe symptoms. These women require additional treatment to relieve excessive bleeding and pain. Tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic agent, is approved for use to treat heavy menstrual bleeding. GnRH agonists are used for short-term therapy and may involve low-dose estradiol and progestin hormonal add-back therapy to lower the side effect of bone mineral density loss and reduce vasomotor symptoms generally associated with GnRH agonists. Surgical intervention, such as myomectomy or hysterectomy, are often used to treat the heavy bleeding and symptoms associated with uterine fibroids; however, these procedures may result in post-operative complications, complications with future pregnancy, or even preclude the potential for future pregnancies. Even if a future pregnancy is not desired, many women prefer to avoid surgical intervention. However, heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids is a leading cause of hysterectomy, resulting in approximately 250,000 hysterectomies per year in the U.S. alone.

Our Phase 3 Program for the Treatment of Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Associated with Uterine Fibroids
We initiated a Phase 3 clinical program in January 2017, evaluating relugolix in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. The program consists of two international, replicate pivotal clinical trials, which we refer to as LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2. Each trial randomizes women 1:1:1 to one of three treatment arms: relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered with commercially available low-dose hormonal add-back therapy for 24 weeks, relugolix 40 mg once daily monotherapy for 12 weeks followed by relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered with hormonal add-back therapy for an additional 12 weeks, or placebo once daily for a period of 24 weeks. We expect to enroll approximately 390 women in each of the two replicate LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 trials. Eligible women completing the initial 24-week period will be offered an active treatment extension with relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered with hormonal add-back therapy for an additional 28-week period, or a total treatment period of 52 weeks, to evaluate the safety of longer-term treatment. We expect to complete enrollment for the LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 trials during calendar year 2018 and anticipate results from these trials during calendar year 2019.
The primary efficacy endpoint for LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 is the proportion of all women enrolled who achieve a menstrual blood loss volume of less than 80 mL and at least a 50% reduction in menstrual blood loss volume from baseline over the last month of treatment as measured by the alkaline hematin method, a quantitative measurement of menstrual blood loss. The secondary efficacy endpoints include measures of change from baseline in hemoglobin, assessment of the impact of therapy on quality-of-life measures, the reduction in uterine and fibroid volume, and pain reduction. Safety, including bone mineral density changes as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, is also being assessed. If the results of LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 are favorable, we intend to submit a new drug application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in calendar year 2019. We will conduct a bridging study intended to support approval of the fixed-dose combination of relugolix with low-dose estradiol and progestin. We may conduct additional clinical trials to further support the commercial potential of relugolix in uterine fibroids in the U.S. and other major markets.
Takeda Phase 3 Clinical Development for Uterine Fibroids 
In October 2017, Takeda reported positive top-line results from its Phase 3 trial in Japan evaluating the efficacy and safety of relugolix monotherapy compared with leuprorelin for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. In this trial, approximately 280 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either 40 mg of relugolix administered orally once daily or leuprorelin acetate administered by injection once every four weeks. Relugolix achieved an 82.2% response rate, met the primary endpoint, which was the proportion of patients achieving a pre-defined reduction in menstrual bleeding, and was observed to be statistically non-inferior to leuprorelin alone (p = 0.0013). Additionally, in November 2017, Takeda reported positive top-line results from its Phase 3 trial in Japan evaluating the efficacy and safety of relugolix for the treatment of pain associated with uterine fibroids. In this trial, 65 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either 40 mg relugolix or placebo administered orally once daily. Relugolix demonstrated a marked improvement in pain in 57.6% of women with uterine fibroids compared to 3.1% of women receiving placebo (p < 0.0001) and met the primary endpoint. Adverse events in both studies were consistent with the mechanism of action of relugolix and adverse events observed in previous clinical trials. The Phase 3 data from each of these trials will be available to us and may be used to support our anticipated NDA submission. On February 28, 2018, Takeda announced that it had submitted the data from both of these trials to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan for marketing authorization of relugolix in Japan for the treatment of uterine fibroids. We will be solely responsible for obtaining FDA approval for relugolix in the U.S.
Endometriosis
Endometriosis is a disease in which tissue that normally lines the uterus is found outside the uterine cavity. Endometriosis lesions commonly appear in the lower abdomen or pelvis or on ovaries, the bladder, or the colon. During the menstrual cycle, the lesions grow, differentiate, and shed into the abdomen, thereby inducing a cascade of inflammatory events. The symptoms associated with endometriosis can include painful periods and chronic pelvic pain, painful ovulation, pain during or after sexual intercourse, heavy bleeding, fatigue, and even infertility. Endometriosis can also impact general physical, mental, and social well-being.
According to the Endometriosis Foundation, endometriosis affects an estimated 1-in-10 women during their reproductive years and, in the U.S., can take an average of 10 years from the onset of symptoms to accurately diagnose, often leading to unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. We estimate that approximately 6 million women in the U.S. suffer from symptomatic endometriosis, 1.2 million of whom are inadequately treated by oral contraceptives and require additional treatment.

Similar to uterine fibroids, lowering estrogen levels has been shown to reduce pain associated with endometriosis, and there are a variety of medical and surgical treatments available. Initial treatment usually involves over-the-counter pain medications, including NSAIDs, because pain is the primary symptom. In more severe cases, GnRH agonists such as leuprolide are used for short-term treatment and may involve hormonal add-back therapy. The FDA has approved Lupaneta Pack, or leuprolide administered with NETA (5 mg), to treat pain associated with endometriosis while lowering the side effect of bone mineral density loss and reducing vasomotor symptoms. For many patients, surgical intervention, typically laparoscopy with ablation of endometriotic lesions, is ultimately undertaken to relieve pain and opioid medications are frequently needed to control pain both before and after surgery. After treatment with hormonal therapy or laparoscopic procedures, recurrence of endometriosis and related symptoms is common, resulting in repeated procedures for many women. In addition, approximately 100,000 endometriosis-related hysterectomies are performed each year in the U.S., although hysterectomy is not a cure for endometriosis and pain associated with endometriosis will not necessarily subside following hysterectomy.
Our Phase 3 Program for the Treatment of Endometriosis- Associated Pain 
We initiated a Phase 3 clinical program in June 2017, evaluating relugolix in women with endometriosis-associated pain. The program consists of two international replicate pivotal clinical trials, which we refer to as SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2. Each trial randomizes women 1:1:1 to one of three treatment arms: relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered with low-dose hormonal add-back therapy for 24 weeks, relugolix 40 mg once daily monotherapy for 12 weeks followed by relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered with commercially available hormonal add-back therapy for an additional 12 weeks, or placebo once daily for a period of 24 weeks. We expect to enroll approximately 600 women in each of the two replicate SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2 trials. Eligible women completing the initial 24-week period will be offered an active treatment extension with relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered with hormonal add-back therapy for an additional 28-week period, or a total treatment period of 52 weeks, to evaluate the safety of longer-term treatment. We expect to complete enrollment for and anticipate results from the SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2 trials during calendar year 2019.
The co-primary efficacy endpoints for these trials are the proportion of all women enrolled with reductions in both dysmenorrhea, or menstrual pelvic pain, and nonmenstrual pelvic pain, as assessed by an endometriosis-specific patient questionnaire administered daily, with no increase in background pain medication. Secondary endpoints will include additional questionnaires assessing functional changes associated with endometriosis-specific pain and quality of life, and the use of pain medications to treat endometriosis. Safety, including bone mineral density changes as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, will be assessed. If the results of SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2 are favorable, we intend to submit an NDA to the FDA. We expect to provide guidance on the timing of the regulatory submission upon completion of enrollment. If not already completed for the uterine fibroid indication described previously, we will conduct a bridging study intended to support approval of the fixed-dose combination of relugolix with low-dose estradiol and progestin. We may conduct additional clinical trials to further support the commercial potential of relugolix in endometriosis in the U.S. and other major markets.
Advanced Prostate Cancer
Prostate cancer is the second most prevalent form of cancer in men and the second leading cause of death due to cancer in men in the U.S. According to the National Cancer Institute, approximately 3.1 million men are currently living with prostate cancer in the U.S., and approximately165,000 men are newly diagnosed each year. Men with prostate cancer are often asymptomatic at the earliest stages of disease and prostate cancer is generally understood to be slow to progress, leading to a median age at diagnosis of 66 years and a five-year survival rate of 98.2%. 
If prostate cancer is diagnosed at a stage where it is confined to the prostate gland and immediate surroundings, it is generally treated by surgical removal of the prostate gland, or prostatectomy, or with radiation. Often, these procedures are successful in curing men of their disease. Men whose disease progresses after prostatectomy or radiation are said to have advanced prostate cancer. Advanced prostate cancer is defined as any of the following: prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, biochemical relapse following primary surgical or radiation therapy of curative intent; newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer; or advanced localized disease for which immediate radiation or surgical therapy is not indicated. The cure rate following surgery, depending on the stage of the cancer, is about 70% overall and, following radiation, about 50% to 60%. Approximately 25% to 30% of men will, therefore, progress to advanced disease, excluding those with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. 
8

First-line treatment for advanced prostate cancer typically involves treatment with androgen deprivation therapies, or ADT, which are therapies that substantially reduce testosterone. This is because androgens, such as testosterone, promote the growth of cancerous prostate cells by binding to and activating the androgen receptor which, once activated, stimulates prostate cancer cell growth. ADT consisting of either medical castration or surgical castration, or removal of the testes which produce testosterone, can be successful in delaying prostate cancer progression. More than 80% of patients with advanced prostate cancer initially respond to ADT with varying degrees of tumor regression or stabilization. The duration and depth of response to ADT is presumably dependent on the underlying tumor biology and burden. Thus, patients with metastatic prostate cancer, or prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, respond for an average of two years before any biochemical evidence of castration resistance occurs. By contrast, patients with biochemical-only evidence of progressive disease may respond to ADT for five years or more. As prostate cancer progresses, men remain on ADT while other therapies are added, typically until death. 
The most commonly prescribed ADTs are GnRH agonists, such as long-acting leuprolide depot injections. GnRH agonists initially stimulate testosterone production, but with chronic stimulation of the GnRH receptors, the pituitary gland desensitizes and luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone decrease with a resultant reduction in testosterone three to four weeks after the initiation of therapy. The initial stimulation of testosterone can cause an initial worsening of symptoms, or clinical flare. GnRH agonists are often given as depot formulations, requiring injections every month, three months or six months, and testosterone remains suppressed for weeks and months after cessation of therapy. 
Our Phase 3 Program for the Treatment of Advanced Prostate Cancer 
We initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial in March of 2017, evaluating relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer, which we refer to as the HERO trial. We believe that the HERO trial, if successful, will be sufficient to support the filing of an NDA based on an End-of-Phase 2 meeting held with the FDA. The European Scientific Advice procedure and an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the Japanese health authority have also been completed supporting the design of the HERO trial.
The HERO trial is enrolling men with advanced prostate cancer who require ADT and randomizes men to treatment with either oral relugolix 120 mg once daily (after a single oral loading dose of 360 mg) or a depot injection of leuprolide (per national or regional product label) for a period of at least 48 weeks. We expect to enroll approximately 915 men into this trial, with approximately 610 men enrolled into the active treatment arm and 305 men into the leuprolide arm. During the fourth quarter of calendar year 2017, we decreased the expected enrollment from 1,125 to 915 to reflect a change in strategy in China. The decrease in enrollment does not affect the statistical powering of the primary endpoint analysis, which has always been based on the first 915 patients enrolled in the HERO trial. We are in discussions with Takeda regarding the strategy for registration of relugolix for advanced prostate cancer in China. Based on FDA discussions, we believe that we will be required to conduct only one Phase 3 trial with a single relugolix arm to gain approval for relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer in the U.S. Nonetheless, we have designed the trial to include a second arm with leuprolide to demonstrate that treatment with relugolix is noninferior to leuprolide in achieving sustained suppression of testosterone to castrate levels over 48 weeks, an outcome expected to be required for approval in other major markets. We expect to complete enrollment for the HERO trial during calendar year 2018 and anticipate results from this trial during calendar year 2019. 
The primary efficacy endpoint accepted by the FDA is testosterone suppression (≤ 50 ng/dL) from week 5, day 1 through week 48, day 7. Relugolix must demonstrate that the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the percent of patients achieving testosterone suppression through 48 weeks is at least 90%. The secondary efficacy endpoint is PSA reduction as a percentage change from baseline. Testosterone suppression is an approvable endpoint in the U.S. and several hormonal therapies have been approved based on this endpoint. If the results of this trial are favorable, we intend to submit an NDA to the FDA. We may conduct additional clinical trials to further support the commercial potential of relugolix in prostate cancer in the U.S. and other major markets.

MVT-602
As part of our license agreement with Takeda, or the Takeda License Agreement, we acquired the worldwide rights to MVT-602, our second product candidate, which has been evaluated in over 150 men. MVT-602 is an oligopeptide kisspeptin agonist. Kisspeptin is a naturally-occurring peptide that stimulates GnRH release and is required for puberty and maintenance of normal reproductive function, including production of sperm, follicular maturation and ovulation, and production of estrogen and progesterone in women and testosterone in men. In a completed Phase 1 study in healthy female volunteers, a single injection of MVT-602 was observed to cause a dose-dependent luteinizing hormone surge. We have initiated a Phase 2a clinical trial in healthy female volunteers to characterize the dose response curve in the controlled ovarian stimulation setting prior to studying MVT-602 in infertile women seeking pregnancy. MVT-602 is being developed as a potential treatment for female infertility in women as part of assisted reproduction, such as in vitro fertilization, or IVF. Approximately 1.5 million assisted reproduction cycles are performed each year worldwide. Further, approximately 25% of women suffering from infertility have problems achieving ovulation, including the inability to produce fully-matured eggs or the failure to ovulate, most commonly resulting from hormonal dysfunction in the GnRH-luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone axis. We believe MVT-602 has the potential to be a safer alternative to human chorionic gonadotropin as a part of assisted reproduction for the treatment of female infertility.
We believe that MVT-602, an analog of the naturally-occurring kisspeptin peptide in humans, may mimic natural physiology by inducing a luteinizing hormone surge during IVF and other assisted reproductive technologies, enhancing the likelihood of successful egg maturation and ovulation at the right time without the serious side effect of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, or OHSS. While assisted reproductive technologies are effective, typically resulting in pregnancy in 20% to 35% of patients, the standard procedure has remained largely unchanged since inception and has potentially serious side effects. The most serious side effect of assisted reproduction is OHSS. Severe OHSS has been reported to occur in up to 2% of the general assisted reproduction population, and in up to 20% of patients at high-risk for developing OHSS. OHSS is thought to occur as a result of the nonphysiologic elevations in luteinizing hormone that occur as a result of egg maturation triggered with human chorionic gonadotropin and to a lesser extent the GnRH receptor agonists.
By acting upstream in the GnRH-axis to promote the release of physiologically normal levels of key hormones in the assisted reproduction cycle such as luteinizing hormone, kisspeptin agonists, such as MVT-602, may have the potential to trigger egg maturation without causing OHSS. A recently published investigator-sponsored trial where a native kisspeptin peptide (specifically, kisspeptin 54) was used in place of human chorionic gonadotropin as the egg-maturation trigger in the assisted reproduction cycle showed that none of the 60 high-risk patients developed moderate-to-severe OHSS and resulted in a live birth rate of up to 65.1% at the maximally efficacious dose tested. These encouraging results validate the potential use of kisspeptin analogs as a safe alternative to the standard egg maturation trigger in assisted reproduction protocols. To our knowledge, MVT-602 is the only kisspeptin agonist in clinical development and thus has the potential to become a safe alternative egg-maturation trigger in this space.

Our Key Agreements
License Agreement with Takeda
In April 2016, we entered into the Takeda License Agreement. Pursuant to the Takeda License Agreement, Takeda granted to us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license under certain patents and other intellectual property controlled by Takeda to develop and commercialize relugolix and MVT-602, and products containing these compounds for all human diseases and conditions. The territory for our exclusive license for relugolix covers all countries worldwide, except that Takeda retains exclusive rights to Japan, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam (including, in each case, the territories and possession of each of the foregoing), which we collectively refer to as the Takeda Territory. Takeda has granted us a nonexclusive license in the Takeda Territory to manufacture relugolix and to conduct development of relugolix for prostate cancer solely for the purpose of developing, manufacturing and commercializing relugolix in our territory. The territory for our exclusive license for MVT-602 covers all countries worldwide. Our license includes a right of reference to regulatory materials related to relugolix and MVT-602 controlled by Takeda. On May 31, 2018, Takeda announced that they entered into a licensing agreement to grant ASKA Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. exclusive commercialization right for uterine fibroids and exclusive development and commercialization rights for endometriosis in Japan.
Under the Takeda License Agreement, we granted to Takeda an exclusive, royalty-bearing license in the Takeda Territory under certain patents and other intellectual property controlled by us to develop and commercialize relugolix and products containing relugolix for all human diseases and conditions, subject to our nonexclusive rights to conduct development and manufacturing as described above. We also granted to Takeda a nonexclusive license in our territory to manufacture relugolix and MVT-602; and to conduct development of relugolix for uterine fibroids and endometriosis solely for the purpose of developing, manufacturing and commercializing relugolix in the Takeda Territory. Takeda’s license includes a right of reference to regulatory materials controlled by us. If Takeda determines not to seek regulatory approval for or to commercialize relugolix in any country in the Takeda Territory, then we have a right of first negotiation to acquire the rights to seek regulatory approval and commercialize relugolix in such country.
We are solely responsible, at our expense, for all activities related to the development of relugolix and MVT-602 in our territory and all activities related to the development of relugolix through the receipt of regulatory approval for prostate cancer in the Takeda Territory. Pursuant to the terms of the Takeda License Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval of relugolix for the treatment, prevention, cure or control of symptoms associated with uterine fibroids or endometriosis and MVT-602 in our territory, as well as to develop and obtain regulatory approval of relugolix for prostate cancer in Japan and the U.S. We are solely responsible, at our expense, for all activities related to the commercialization of relugolix and MVT-602 in our territory and must use commercially reasonable efforts to do so in each country in our territory in which we obtain regulatory approval. Takeda is solely responsible, at its expense, for all activities related to the commercialization of relugolix in the Takeda Territory, and must use diligent efforts to commercialize relugolix for prostate cancer in the Takeda Territory following receipt of regulatory approval.
We will pay Takeda a fixed, high single-digit royalty on net sales of relugolix and MVT-602 products in our territory, subject to certain agreed reductions. Takeda will pay us a royalty at the same rate as ours on net sales of relugolix products for prostate cancer in the Takeda Territory, subject to certain agreed reductions. Royalties are required to be paid, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latest to occur of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of a licensed patent covering such product in such country, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country, or 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country. Under the Takeda License Agreement, there was no upfront payment and there are no payments upon the achievement of clinical development or marketing approval milestones.
During the period commencing on the effective date of the Takeda License Agreement and ending two years after the first commercial sale of product containing relugolix in a major market country, we and our controlling shareholder, Roivant Sciences Ltd., or RSL, have both agreed that we will not, directly or indirectly, and will cause all of our respective affiliates (other than any affiliate that is a public company) not to, alone or with others, research (or fund any research), develop, make, use, sell, offer for sale, or import any competing product in our territory or the Takeda Territory or enter into any agreement with any third party with respect to a license or other acquisition of rights relating to any competing product in our territory or the Takeda Territory. For these purposes, a competing product is (1) any small molecule oral GnRH receptor antagonist (other than a product containing relugolix) for uterine fibroids, endometriosis, or prostate cancer, and (2) any product containing MVT-602 for prostate cancer in the Takeda Territory. If, during such period, we or any of our nonpublic affiliates is acquired by a third party that is developing or commercializing a competing product, then we must divest our interest or terminate the development or commercialization of the competing product or cause our affiliate to do so.
11

The Takeda License Agreement will expire, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, on the expiration of the royalty payment term described above for such product in such country. Either party may terminate the Takeda License Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach, challenge to the patents licensed under the Takeda License Agreement, or insolvency. Takeda may terminate the Takeda License Agreement with respect to a compound if we cease development or commercialization of such compound. We may terminate the agreement at will, in our sole discretion, in its entirety, or with respect to relugolix for prostate cancer or both endometriosis and uterine fibroids, or on a compound by compound basis for all fields, upon prior notice, with the notice period depending on the compound and field to be terminated and the regulatory status at the time that notice of termination is given. We may also terminate the agreement with respect to a compound for safety reasons or lack of commercial viability. If the agreement is terminated in its entirety or with respect to relugolix for prostate cancer, other than for safety reasons or by us for Takeda’s uncured material breach, prior to receipt of the first regulatory approval of relugolix for prostate cancer in Japan, then we must either reimburse Takeda for its out of pocket costs and expenses directly incurred in connection with Takeda’s completion of the relugolix development for prostate cancer, up to an agreed cap, or complete ourselves the conduct of any clinical trials of relugolix for prostate cancer that are ongoing as of the effective date of such termination, at our cost and expense. If we reimburse Takeda for such costs, then under certain circumstances we may be later reimbursed by Takeda through a royalty on sales of the terminated relugolix product.
In connection with the Takeda License Agreement, we issued 5,077,001 of our common shares, then equal to 12% of our outstanding share capital, to Takeda pursuant to a subscription agreement, and also issued Takeda a warrant to enable it to maintain its 12% ownership of us through the one-year anniversary of the warrant, unless earlier terminated as a result of our change in control. We issued a total of 2,343,624 of our common shares to Takeda under this warrant prior to its expiration on April 30, 2017. We also entered into an investor rights agreement with Takeda, pursuant to which Takeda and RSL, the other shareholder party thereto, are entitled to certain rights with respect to the registration of their common shares under the Securities Act. 
Manufacture and Supply Agreements with Takeda 
In June 2016, we and one of Takeda’s affiliates, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda Limited, entered into an agreement for the manufacture and supply of relugolix. Under this agreement, Takeda Limited will supply us, and we will obtain from Takeda Limited, all of our requirements for relugolix drug substance and drug product to be used under our development plans for all indications. If we request, Takeda Limited will assist us with a technical transfer of the manufacturing process for relugolix to us or our designee and we will pay the expenses related to such transfer. 
On May 30, 2018, we entered into a Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Takeda, or the Takeda Commercial Supply Agreement, pursuant to which Takeda will manufacture and supply us with relugolix drug substance to support the commercial launch of relugolix, if marketing authorization is granted. Takeda has agreed to assist with the transfer of technology and manufacturing know-how to a second contract manufacturing organization of our subsidiary, Myovant Sciences GmbH. We will pay the expenses related to such transfers.
Right of First Negotiation and Board Observer Agreement with Pfizer
In October 2016, we and an entity affiliated with Pfizer Inc., or the Pfizer Affiliate, entered into a right of first negotiation and board observer agreement, or the Pfizer Agreement. Pursuant to the Pfizer Agreement, we granted to the Pfizer Affiliate, upon the closing of the sale of at least $30.0 million of our common shares to the Pfizer Affiliate in our initial public offering, or the IPO, a right of first negotiation with respect to any transaction that we would propose to a third party involving (A) the license or sale of rights to develop and commercialize relugolix or MVT-602 for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, endometriosis-associated pain, advanced prostate cancer, or female infertility as part of assisted reproduction, in each case, in a major market country, or (B) a change of control of Myovant or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets. The right of first negotiation will terminate upon the earliest of (1) the third anniversary of the IPO, (2) such time as the Pfizer Affiliate, together with its affiliates, owns less than 51% of the common shares purchased by the Pfizer Affiliate in the IPO, (3) a change of control of Myovant, (4) the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets and (5) the liquidation or other dissolution of Myovant. In addition, during such period that the Pfizer Affiliate holds a right of first negotiation, one representative of the Pfizer Affiliate may attend any meetings of our board of directors in a non-voting observer capacity, subject to standard exceptions, such as conflict of interest. Such observer right will also terminate at such time as we file an NDA with the FDA for relugolix. The Pfizer Agreement will terminate upon the earliest of (1) the fifth anniversary of the closing of the IPO, (2) such time as the Pfizer Affiliate, together with its affiliates, owns less than 51% of the common shares purchased by the Pfizer Affiliate in the IPO, (3) a change of control of Myovant, (4) the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets, (5) the liquidation or other dissolution of Myovant, and (6) such time as we file an NDA with the FDA for relugolix.

Option Agreement with Roivant Sciences Limited
In June 2016, we entered into an option agreement with RSL pursuant to which RSL granted to us an option to acquire the rights to products to which RSL or any non-public affiliate of RSL acquires the rights (other than a relugolix product or a competing product, as described under the section titled “—License Agreement with Takeda” above) for uterine fibroids or endometriosis, or for which the primary target indication is hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Our option is exercisable at any time during the period commencing on November 1, 2016 (the date we closed the IPO) and ending two years following the date of first commercial sale of a relugolix product in a major market country. If we elect to exercise our option for a product, we will be required to reimburse RSL for 110% of any payments made by RSL or its affiliate for such product, and will receive an assignment of the agreement through which RSL or its affiliate acquired the rights to such product.
Information Sharing and Cooperation Agreement
In July 2016, we entered into an information sharing and cooperation agreement, or the Cooperation Agreement, with RSL. The Cooperation Agreement, among other things: (1) obligates us to deliver periodic financial statements and other financial information to RSL and to comply with other specified financial reporting requirements; and (2) requires us to supply certain material information to RSL to assist it in preparing any future U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, filings.
Subject to specified exceptions, the Cooperation Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of the mutual written consent of the parties or when RSL is no longer required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, to consolidate our results of operations and financial position, account for its investment in us under the equity method of accounting or, by any rule of the SEC, include our separate financial statements in any filings it may make with the SEC.
Services Agreements with Roivant Sciences, Inc. and Roivant Sciences GmbH
In July 2016, we and our wholly owned subsidiary Myovant Sciences, Inc., or MSI, entered into a formal services agreement, or the RSI Services Agreement, with Roivant Sciences, Inc., or RSI, a wholly owned subsidiary of RSL, effective April 29, 2016, under which RSI agreed to provide certain administrative and research and development, or R&D, services to us. Under the RSI Services Agreement, we pay or reimburse RSI for any expenses it, or third parties acting on its behalf, incurs for us. For any general and administrative, or G&A, and R&D activities performed by RSI employees, RSI charges back the employee compensation expense plus a pre-determined mark-up. RSI also provided such services prior to the formalization of the RSI Services Agreement, and such costs have been recognized by us in the period in which the services were rendered. Employee compensation expense, inclusive of base salary and fringe benefits, is determined based upon the relative percentage of time utilized on our matters by the respective employee. All other third-party pass thru costs are billed to us at cost. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include third-party expenses incurred on behalf of us that have been paid by RSI and RSL. 
In February 2017, we and MSI amended and restated the RSI Services Agreement, effective November 11, 2016, to include our wholly owned subsidiary, Myovant Sciences GmbH, or MSG, as a services recipient. In addition, in February 2017, MSG also entered into a separate services agreement, or the RSG Services Agreement, with Roivant Sciences GmbH, or RSG, a wholly owned subsidiary of RSL, effective November 11, 2016, for the provisioning of services by RSG to MSG in relation to the identification of potential product candidates and project management of clinical trials, as well as other services related to clinical development, administrative, and finance activities. We refer to the RSI Services Agreement and the RSG Services Agreement, collectively, as the Services Agreements.
Our Strategy 
Our goal is to be the leading global biopharmaceutical company focused on treating women’s health and endocrine diseases in areas of high unmet medical need, and to improve the lives of millions of patients suffering from these diseases. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal include the following: 

• | rapidly advance clinical development of relugolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids and endometriosis-associated pain;


• | rapidly advance clinical development of relugolix for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer;


• | advance clinical development of MVT-602;


• | expand clinical development of relugolix for additional indications;


• | acquire or in-license additional clinical- or commercial-stage product candidates for the treatment of women’s health or endocrine diseases in a capital-efficient manner; and


• | maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates.

13

Sales and Marketing 
We are currently building our sales and marketing infrastructure; however, we currently do not have established marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities. In order to commercialize our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, we must either develop a sales and marketing infrastructure or collaborate with third-parties that have sales and marketing experience. We plan to directly commercialize our product candidates in the U.S. In other markets for which commercialization may be less capital efficient for us, we may selectively pursue strategic collaborations with third parties in order to maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates. 
Manufacturing
We have no experience in drug formulation or manufacturing and do not own or operate, and we do not expect to own or operate, facilities for manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing of our product candidates. In June 2016, we and Takeda Limited entered into an agreement for the manufacture and supply of relugolix. Under this agreement, Takeda Limited will supply us, and we will obtain from Takeda Limited, all of our requirements for relugolix drug substance and drug product to be used under our development plans for all indications. We also rely on a limited number of third-party contract manufacturers for packaging and distribution of finished drug products for our clinical trials, sourcing of comparator products, and development of new products. If we request, Takeda Limited will assist us with a technical transfer of the manufacturing process for relugolix drug substance and drug product to us or our designee and we will pay the expenses related to such transfer. 
We expect that manufacturing support provided by Takeda to us under the Takeda License Agreement will be sufficient for us to complete our planned Phase 3 programs for relugolix. If relugolix is approved by the FDA, we also plan to rely on Takeda or other third-party manufacturers to supply us with sufficient commercial quantities of relugolix. We expect that the MVT-602 drug substance transferred from Takeda to us under the Takeda License Agreement will be sufficient for our near-term development plans, however, additional process development and manufacturing would be required in order for us to complete Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies for MVT-602. We intend to contract with third-party contract manufacturers to complete the additional development and manufacturing activities for our current programs and to fill, finish, supply, store, and distribute drug product for these programs. If there is a delay in initiating a new relationship with one or more other third-party manufacturers or a delay in completing technology transfer to any of these manufacturers, we could experience delays in our development and commercialization efforts.
Relugolix is a synthetic small molecule that can be manufactured using well-established technologies. We have acquired and continue to acquire data from Takeda related to the chemical synthesis and manufacturing of relugolix drug substance and drug product, and we expect that we will be able to contract with third-party manufacturers for commercial supplies of relugolix on a cost-efficient basis based on our understanding of the conventional technologies utilized in manufacturing relugolix. On May 30, 2018, we entered into the Takeda Commercial Supply Agreement pursuant to which Takeda will manufacture and supply us with relugolix drug substance to support the commercial launch of relugolix, if marketing authorization is granted. Takeda has agreed to assist with the transfer of technology and manufacturing know-how to a second contract manufacturing organization of our subsidiary, Myovant Sciences GmbH. We will pay the expense related to such transfers. In anticipation of receiving marketing approval by a regulatory agency for any one of our products, we intend to enter into additional agreements with Takeda and/or other third-party contract manufacturers for the commercial production of those products.
Manufacturing of any product candidate is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern recordkeeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. We expect that all of our contract manufacturing organizations will manufacture relugolix under current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, conditions. cGMP is a regulatory standard for the production of pharmaceuticals to be used in humans.
14

Competition 
We consider relugolix’s most direct competitor for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids and endometriosis-associated pain to be elagolix, an oral GnRH receptor antagonist currently being developed by AbbVie in conjunction with Neurocrine Biosciences. In addition, we are aware of several companies that are developing drugs that would compete against relugolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, endometriosis-associated pain, and/or advanced prostate cancer and against MVT-602 for the treatment of female infertility as part of assisted reproduction. AbbVie has completed two Phase 3 trials for elagolix in women with endometriosis-associated pain and filed an NDA in September 2017. In October 2017, AbbVie announced that the FDA granted priority review for elagolix for the management of endometriosis with associated pain and expects that the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, date for the FDA to complete its review will be in the second quarter of 2018. In April 2018, AbbVie announced that the U.S. FDA has extended the PDUFA date by three months to the third quarter of 2018 for review of additional information. Abbvie also commenced two Phase 3b trials of elagolix in combination with hormonal add-back therapy in women with pain associated with endometriosis in 2017, which are ongoing. In the first quarter of 2018, AbbVie announced that each of its two pivotal Phase 3 trials evaluating elagolix with and without hormonal add-back therapy in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, met their primary endpoint. In addition, ObsEva SA, a Swiss-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, reported the commencement of two Phase 3 clinical trials of linzagolix (OBE2109), also an oral GnRH receptor antagonist, in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in the first half of 2017. We believe the development of multiple GnRH receptor antagonists by other biopharmaceutical companies adds further validation to the therapeutic relevance of GnRH as a target for the treatment of women’s health and endocrine diseases. 
In January 2017, Allergan and Gedeon Richter announced positive results from the second of two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ulipristal acetate, a selective progesterone receptor modulator, in women with abnormal bleeding due to uterine fibroids. The FDA accepted the filing of their NDA submission for this indication in October 2017. On May 18, 2018, the European Medicines Agency Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, or PRAC, completed its review of Esmya (ulipristal acetate) following reports of serious liver injury. The PRAC concluded that Esmya may have contributed to the development of some cases of serious liver injury. The PRAC has recommended that Esmya must not be used in women with known liver problems and should be used for more than one treatment course only in women who are not eligible for surgery. Liver function testing should be performed at the start of each treatment course and once a month and for two to four weeks after stopping treatment for the first two treatment courses. In February 2018, Allergan announced that the U.S. FDA had extended the PDUFA date by three months to the third quarter of 2018 to provide time for a full review of the file. Other GnRH receptor antagonists and selective progesterone receptor modulators are also in development, including vilaprisan, a selective steroidal progesterone receptor modulator, for which Bayer recently initiated a head-to-head study of vilaprisan compared with ulipristal acetate in women with heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids and a long-term safety study of vilaprisan compared with standard of care. 
In addition to other GnRH receptor antagonists and selective progesterone receptor modulators in active development, we are aware of other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies as well as academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions that are developing, and may in the future develop and commercialize, products for gender-specific hormone disorders. The pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and require an ongoing, extensive search for technological innovation. These industries are characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. Our ability to compete will significantly depend upon our ability to effectively complete necessary clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, and effectively commercialize, market, and promote approved products. Our current and potential future competitors include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, and government agencies. The primary competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of any product candidate for which we may receive marketing approval include efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, acceptance by physicians, ease of patient compliance, dosing convenience, price, insurance and other reimbursement coverage, distribution, and marketing. Many of our existing or potential future competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those product candidates in the U.S. and in foreign countries. 
Our current and potential future competitors also have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competition. 
Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining regulatory approval for therapies and in achieving widespread market acceptance of their drugs. It is also possible that the development of a cure or more effective treatment method for uterine fibroids, endometriosis or prostate cancer by a competitor could render our product candidate non-competitive or obsolete or reduce the demand for our product candidate before we can recover our development and commercialization expenses. 
15

Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for relugolix, MVT-602 and any of our future product candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing and in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
Generally, issued patents are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest claimed non-provisional filing date. In certain instances, patent term can be adjusted to recapture a portion of delay by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in examining the patent application (patent term adjustment, or PTA) or extended to account for term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period (patent term extension, or PTE), or both. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or future applications or that any issued patents will adequately protect our products or product candidates. 
Under the Takeda License Agreement, we are the exclusive licensee of multiple granted U.S. patents, and pending patent applications, as well as patents and patent applications in numerous foreign jurisdictions relating to relugolix and MVT-602. 
For relugolix, we are the exclusive worldwide licensee, excluding the Takeda Territory. These patents and patent applications cover the relugolix molecule and certain analogs and the use of relugolix to treat sex-hormone dependent prostate cancer and hysteromyoma (uterine fibroids); methods of manufacturing; and certain formulations. The patent family directed to the relugolix molecule and its use expires in 2024, subject to any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. We intend to apply for PTE for a patent covering relugolix. If granted, the patent term covering relugolix as a composition of matter may be extended for up to five years, or 2029. The patents and patent applications directed to methods of manufacturing and formulations, if issued, expire in 2033 and 2036, respectively, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. We have also filed patent applications directed to uses of relugolix with add-back in treating, among other conditions, heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids and endometriosis-associated pain, and to the use of relugolix to treat advanced prostate cancer. These applications are co-owned with Takeda under the Takeda License Agreement. These patent applications, if issued, would expire in 2037 subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. 
For MVT-602, we are the exclusive worldwide licensee of multiple patents and patent applications in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. These patents and patent applications cover the MVT-602 molecule and its use in treating advanced prostate cancer, as well as certain sustained release formulations containing MVT-602. The patent family directed to the MVT-602 molecule and method of use expires in 2028 in the U.S. (because of PTA) and in 2026 ex-U.S., subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. The patents and patent applications directed to sustained-release formulations of MVT-602, if issued, would expire between 2030 and 2031, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. We intend to apply for PTE for a patent covering MVT-602. If granted, the patent term covering MVT-602 may be extended. We are also the owner of patent applications directed to uses of MVT-602 in treating infertility. These applications, if issued, would expire in 2037 subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country.
In addition to patents, we also rely upon trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We maintain both registered and common law trademarks. Common law trademark protection typically continues where and for as long as the mark is used. Registered trademarks continue in each country for as long as the trademark is registered. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Obtaining patents does not guarantee our right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Third parties may have or obtain rights to patents which could be used to prevent or attempt to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the U.S. that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.

Government Regulation 
FDA Drug Approval Process 
In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. 
We cannot market a drug product candidate in the U.S. until the drug has received FDA approval. The steps required before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally include the following:

• | completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, requirements; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S.

Satisfaction of FDA pre-marketing approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease. 
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of nonclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term nonclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. If the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial, such as whether human research subjects will be exposed to an unreasonable health risk, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. 
Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations, including GCP requirements, as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
17

The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval at each site at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Other Phase 1 studies are usually conducted to understand the absorption, distribution, and metabolism of the drug in special populations and to characterize potential for drug-drug interaction or food effects. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine metabolism, pharmacokinetics, the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials, also called pivotal or registration trials, are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and where confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all nonclinical, clinical, and other testing, and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has established internal substantive review goals of ten months for most NDAs once they have been accepted for filing and 6 months for most applications for priority review once they have been accepted for filing. Priority review can be applied to drugs to treat serious conditions that the FDA determines offer significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with GMP requirements is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
18

An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. A REMS can include a medication guide, a communication plan for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, such as special training and certification requirements for individuals who prescribe or dispense the drug, requirements that patients enroll in a registry, and other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. Such supplements are typically reviewed within 10 months of receipt.
Post-Approval Requirements 
Once an NDA is approved, a product is subject to post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet and social media. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. 
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, REMS, or surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or restrictions on the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to GMP requirements after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with GMP requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with GMP requirements. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacture of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;


• | fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

Foreign Regulation 
In order to market any product outside of the U.S., we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety, and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the U.S. apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
19

Other Healthcare Laws 
Although we currently do not have any products on the market, our current and future business operations may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting, and physician sunshine laws. Some of our pre-commercial activities are subject to some of these laws. 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item, or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced-price items and services. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, and can also result in criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. 
Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Persons and entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, certain of our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information, and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for federal civil False Claims Act violations may include up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, False Claims Act violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. At present, it is unclear if we would be considered a business associate subject to HIPAA based on our business activities and service offerings upon the commercialization of a product. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state and foreign laws, regulations, standards and regulatory guidance govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties. 
The ACA through the enactment of the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, imposes, among other things, annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value, and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties. 
Many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. We may also be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, as well as state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Additionally, to the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we intend to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject. Although the development and implementation of compliance programs designed to establish internal control and facilitate compliance can mitigate the risk of violating these laws, and the subsequent investigation, prosecution, and penalties assessed for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements, and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, and individual imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA. The FCPA prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from processing, offering, or making payments of money or anything of value to foreign officials with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. In certain countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for the purposes of the FCPA. Our international activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants and agents, even though they may not always be subject to our control. We discourage these practices by our employees, consultants, and agents. However, our existing safeguards may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, consultants, and agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity by U.S. regulators, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement activity by both the Department of Justice and the SEC. A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of suppliers, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses or permits, and legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or governmental investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence. 
21

Other Applicable Laws
We are subject to a variety of financial disclosure and securities trading regulations as a public company in the U.S., including laws relating to the oversight activities of the SEC and the regulations of the New York Stock Exchange, on which our common shares are traded. 
We are also subject to various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including those related to safe working conditions, and the storage, transportation, or discharge of items that may be considered hazardous substances, hazardous waste, or environmental contaminants. 
In addition, we are subject to or affected by federal, state and foreign privacy, security and data protection laws, regulations, standards and regulatory guidance that govern the collection, use, disclosure, retention, security and transfer of personal data. Our operations extend to countries around the world, and many of these jurisdictions have established privacy legal frameworks with which we, our customers or our vendors must comply.
Health Reform 
In the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. There have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. 
In particular, the ACA has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The ACA was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA revises the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products. In January 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a final rule regarding the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, effective April 1, 2016, that, among other things, revises the manner in which the AMP is to be calculated by manufacturers participating in the program and implements certain amendments to the Medicaid rebate statute created under the ACA. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare providers and entities, and a significant number of provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective. 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as efforts by the current administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. For example, since January 2017, the President has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA were signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Additionally, on January 22, 2018, the President signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole,” and increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in the Medicare Part D program. There may be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. The ACA is likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. 
22

Further, there has been heightened government scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed pharmaceutical products. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the current administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, on May 11, 2018, President Trump laid out his administration’s “Blueprint to Lower Drug Prices and Reduce Out-of-Pocket Costs” to reduce the cost of prescription drugs while preserving innovation and cures. The Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same time, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. Although some of these and other proposals will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the current administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
It is uncertain whether and how future legislation, whether domestic or foreign, could affect prospects for our product candidates or what actions foreign, federal, state, or private payors for health care treatment and services may take in response to any such health care reform proposals or legislation. Adoption of price controls and other cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures reforms may prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates. 
Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing, which is being phased in over several years beginning in 2015. Among the requirements of this new legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers’ products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this new legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.

Coverage and Reimbursement 
Sales of our products, if and when approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, private health insurers, and managed care organizations. Third-party payors generally decide which drugs they will cover and establish certain reimbursement levels for such drugs. In particular, in the U.S., private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products, if and when approved, unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of our product candidates, and those of any future product candidate, will therefore depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates, and those of any future product candidate, will be paid by third-party payors. Additionally, the market for our product candidates, and those of any future product candidate, will depend significantly on access to third-party payors’ formularies without prior authorization, step therapy, or other limitations such as approved lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will likely be a time-consuming process.
Third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs (including drug prices) has become a priority of federal and state governments. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution by generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products once approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products once approved or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products could reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have an adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, state and federal healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.
Financial History
We have never been profitable, have incurred significant losses since our inception and we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. We have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and may never generate any revenue from product sales. 
In October 2017, we and our subsidiaries, entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, or the NovaQuest Securities Purchase Agreement, with the purchasers from time to time party thereto and NovaQuest Pharma Opportunities Fund IV L.P., as agent for itself and the purchasers thereto, or NovaQuest, and a Loan and Security Agreement, or the Hercules Loan Agreement, with the lenders from time to time party thereto, and Hercules Capital, Inc., as agent for itself and the lenders thereto, or Hercules. In addition, we entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement, or the NovaQuest Equity Purchase Agreement, with NovaQuest and a purchaser affiliated with NovaQuest, collectively providing us with up to $140.0 million of financing commitments. As of March 31, 2018, a total of $92.0 million remained available to us under the NovaQuest Securities Purchase Agreement and the NovaQuest Equity Purchase Agreement and the $40.0 million financing commitment under the Hercules Loan Agreement was fully drawn. We have funded our operations primarily from the issuance and sale of our common shares and the financing commitments from NovaQuest and Hercules. Additional information regarding these financing commitments is included in Note 5, “Long-term Debt,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
24

The majority of our operating expense is related to R&D activities. Our R&D activities primarily include activities related to the Phase 3 development of our lead product candidate, relugolix, for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, endometriosis-associated pain, and advanced prostate cancer, as well as activities related to the development of MVT-602 for the treatment of female infertility as part of the hormonal preparation used in assisted reproduction. Our R&D expenses totaled $116.8 million and $43.5 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We had no R&D expenses for the period from February 2, 2016 (Date of Inception) to March 31, 2016. We expect our net losses, negative cash flows, and operating expenses to increase as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates, and grow our company. 
As of March 31, 2018, we had approximately $108.6 million of cash and $92.0 million of financing commitments available to us under the NovaQuest Securities Purchase Agreement and the NovaQuest Equity Purchase Agreement. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we issued and sold 3,877,144 of our common shares at a weighted-average-price of $20.67 per common share for aggregate net proceeds to us of approximately $80.1 million after deducting commissions. Specifically, on April 4, 2018, we completed a private placement with RSL, pursuant to which we issued and sold to RSL 1,110,015 of our common shares at a purchase price of $20.27 per common share for total gross proceeds of $22.5 million. In addition, on April 2, 2018, we entered into a sales agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC, or Cowen, to sell our common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million from time to time through an “at-the-market” equity offering program under which Cowen acts as our agent. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, we issued and sold 2,767,129 of our common shares under the sales agreement at a weighted-average-price of $21.47 per common share for aggregate net proceeds to us of approximately $57.6 million, after deducting commissions.
We manage our operations and allocate resources as a single operating and reporting segment. Additional financial information regarding our operations, assets and liabilities, including our net loss for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, and for the period from February 2, 2016 (Date of Inception) to March 31, 2016, and our total assets as of March 31, 2018 and 2017 is included in our consolidated financial statements in Part II. Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Employees 
As of March 31, 2018, we had 86 employees. As described above under “Our Key Agreements—Services Agreements with Roivant Sciences, Inc. and Roivant Sciences GmbH,” certain employees of RSI and RSG provide services to us pursuant to the Services Agreements. Our employees are not represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relations with our employees are good.
Corporate Information 
We are an exempted limited company incorporated under the laws of Bermuda on February 2, 2016 under the name Roivant Endocrinology Ltd. We changed our name to Myovant Sciences Ltd. in May 2016. We have four direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, including Myovant Holdings Limited, a private limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, Myovant Sciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Myovant Sciences GmbH, a company with limited liability formed under the laws of Switzerland and Myovant Sciences Ireland Limited, a company with limited liability formed under the laws of Ireland.
