Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
We are a biopharmaceutical company that historically has been focused on the development and commercialization of Locilex® (pexiganan cream 0.8%), a novel, first-in-class, broad spectrum, topical antibiotic. Locilex® is a chemically synthesized, 22-amino acid peptide isolated from the skin of the African Clawed Frog. Its novel mechanism of action kills microbial targets by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane; a process known as cell membrane permeability. However, in light of recent clinical trial disappointments in our development programs for Locilex®, and our decision to discontinue its development for the treatment of mild infections of diabetic foot ulcers, we have shifted our strategic emphasis to external business opportunities not related to developing Locilex®. As such, although we continue to describe our intellectual property assets and programs herein and continue to maintain our intellectual property rights in the U.S. and internationally, we are no longer pursuing drug development activities for Locilex® pending the outcome of the proposed merger with PLx Pharma Inc. (“PLx Pharma”) and further review of the clinical data from our recently completed Phase 3 program.
Recent Developments
 
On December 22, 2016, we announced our entry into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) with PLx Pharma, pursuant to which, among other things, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours will be merged with and into PLx Pharma, with PLx Pharma continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours (the “Proposed Merger”). Immediately following the effective time of the Proposed Merger, existing PLx Pharma stockholders are expected to own approximately 76.75% of the capital stock of the combined company, and existing Dipexium stockholders are expected to own approximately 23.25% of the capital stock of the combined company, in each case, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Merger Agreement related to our cash on a determination date which approaches the closing of the Proposed Merger.
 
We expect to consummate the Proposed Merger in the second quarter of 2017.
 
We continue to believe that Locilex® has advantages compared to systemic antibiotics and that it may have potential to be approved in a different clinical indication although our medical and scientific team has yet to identify any such indication since the clinical trial data was released on October 25, 2016. We believe that the key attributes of Locilex® are: (i) it has not generated resistant bacteria systemically; (ii) it has not generated cross resistance with other antibiotics; (iii) it has demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of pathogens, including difficult to treat gram negative, and anaerobic bacteria; (iv) it has not been systemically absorbed; (v) it has not caused any significant safety or tolerability issues in over 1,500 patients treated, including the recently completed OneStep-1 and OneStep-2 Phase 3 clinical trials; and (vi) it has demonstrated significant success treating multi-drug resistant bacteria in several laboratory tests and clinical trials performed to date. These attributes lead us to believe that Locilex® could be repositioned to target a different clinical indication despite its failure to achieve any of the primary or secondary endpoints in the OneStep Phase 3 clinical trials in mild infections of diabetic foot ulcers. If pursued, a restart of clinical trials in a yet-to-be-identified clinical indication would involve significant risk, resources and time to design and complete a clinical development program that may very well begin with Phase 1 clinical trials.
 
Our Business Strategy 
 
We seek to develop and commercialize Locilex® (pexiganan cream 0.8%) either directly or through one or more potential partnerships. In the light of the disappointing outcomes of our OneStep-1 and OneStep-2 Phase 3 clincial trials of Locilex® for the treatment of patients with mild infections of diabetic foot ulcers, we have identified and assessed a broad range of strategic options, culminating in our decision to enter into the Merger Agreement with PLx Pharma.

• | Restart clinical and regulatory development of Locilex® in one or more new clinical indications/Proposed Merger with PLx Pharma. Based upon the advice of our research and development consultants, in order to maintain a viable drug development strategy for Locilex®, we need to identify one or more new clinical indications potentially well served by Locilex® and restart drug development activities in at least one new indication. Based on the clinicial evidence from the recently completed OneStep Phase 3 clinical trials, our research and development team has been unable to identify an appropriate clinical indication that we may target with Locilex® for further drug development activities. If identified, a new clinical and regulatory pathway for Locilex® may very well involve restarting with Phase 1 clinical trials and involve significant resources and risk to get back to Phase 3 clinical trials and beyond. Accordingly, we decided to enter into an agreement with respect to the Proposed Merger with PLx Pharma. Assuming the Proposed Merger is consummated as planned in the second quarter of 2017, the combined company will focus its development on PLx Pharma’s product pipeline.

• | Seek value for Locilex® either directly through a restart in a new clinical indication or through one or more partnerships. Whether or not our Proposed Merger with PLx Pharma is completed as planned, we will continue to preserve the Locilex® asset including by maintaining our patent portfolio and preparing and submitting all required regulatory submissions while we evaluate whether or not to develop Locilex® ourselves or through one or more potential future partnerships with third parties. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Because of the high risk nature of restarting clinical development in a yet-to-be-identified clinical indication within which no clinical trials have been performed to date using Locilex® and the high cost of this endeavor, our board of directors and management team have concluded that the Proposed Merger with PLx Pharma is a more attractive alternative to preserve and recapture stockholder value.
 
Corporate Conversion
 
We were organized originally as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware in January 2010. On March 12, 2014, we converted Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation. As a result of the corporate conversion:

• | the Class A Membership Interests of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC became shares of common stock of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. pursuant to a conversion ratio of seven shares of common stock of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for each Class A membership interest of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC previously held. Accordingly, 767,911 Class A Membership Interests of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC issued and outstanding immediately prior to the corporate conversion were converted automatically into 5,375,377 shares of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | all of the outstanding warrants to purchase Class A Membership Interests of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC became warrants to purchase shares of common stock of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in a ratio of seven shares of common stock of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for each Class A membership interest of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC underlying such warrants, with the effect that warrants to purchase 4,900 Class A Membership Interests of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC outstanding immediately prior to the corporate conversion automatically converted into warrants to purchase 34,300 shares of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. upon consummation of the corporate conversion; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the exercise price of all of the outstanding warrants was adjusted in the same ratio as the seven-for-one conversion ratio noted above such that all of our outstanding warrants to purchase Class A Membership Interests of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC which were exercisable at $60 per Class A membership interest were automatically adjusted such that the new exercise price for the outstanding warrants upon consummating the corporate conversion was $8.57 per share, subject to certain adjustments noted in each of the warrants. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In connection with the corporate conversion, Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. continued to hold all property of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC and assumed all of the debts and obligations of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC. Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is governed by a certificate of incorporation filed with the Delaware Secretary of State and bylaws. On the effective date of the corporate conversion, the members of the board of directors of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC became the members of the board of directors of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the officers of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC became the officers of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The purpose of the corporate conversion was to reorganize our corporate structure so that our company would continue as a corporation rather than a limited liability company, and so that our existing investors would own our common stock rather than equity interests in a limited liability company. In order to consummate the corporate conversion, a certificate of conversion was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on March 12, 2014.

Manufacturing and Supply
 
Historically, we used three contract manufacturers (or CMOs) to produce Locilex®. Our manufacturing supply chain for Locilex® started with PolyPeptide Laboratories, Inc. which manufactures pexiganan, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in Locilex®. At our direction, PolyPeptide Laboratories delivered the API to DPT Laboratories, Inc., which formulated the API into a cream formulation on our behalf. DPT Laboratories then delivered the formulated product to Almac Group Limited, which labeled, packaged, and delivered the finished goods for clinical trials as we requested.
 
In the late 1990s, the prior sponsor engaged in an FDA review process for a prior formulation of Locilex®. In its 1999 non-approvable letter, the FDA identified two cGMP manufacturing issues. The first issue concerned the stability of the formulated product. Examination of the formulated product over time showed evidence of water separation from the cream matrix. The second issue related to the purity level of the API in the product. The prior source of the API yielded a purity level as low as 95%.
 
After acquiring the rights to Locilex®, we developed a detailed product development plan to arrive at an optimized formulation to address these issues to the satisfaction of the FDA. We believe that the changes we made to the formulation have resolved the previously observed product separation and impurity levels.
 
We also scaled up the size of our API lots and have completed successfully our scale-up of the first formulated batch of Locilex® cream at the 140 kg batch size. The scale-up was achieved successfully in the view of our manufacturing advisors. We used this commercial-scale batch in the OneStep Phase 3 trials.
 
If we are able to identify a clinical and regulatory pathway forward in light of the recent failure of the OneStep Phase 3 clincial trials, we or a partner who acquires the rights to Locilex® will have adequate stability data on three cGMP registration batches of product supply. Our stability testing is conducted in compliance with the ICH Guideline Q1A(R2): International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, ICH Harmonised Tripartate Guideline, Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products, Current Step 4 version, Dated 6 February 2003. The purpose of the stability testing is to provide evidence on how the quality of a drug substance or drug product varies with time under the influence of a variety of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and light, and to establish a re-test period for the drug substance or a shelf life for the drug product and recommended storage conditions. Our contract research organizations (or CROs) have confirmed that we have sufficient stability data on the three cGMP batches of commercial supply to support any new drug development pathway for Locilex® that may develop or be developed in the future. Our manufacturing experts believe that the stability data supports a shelf life of at least 24 months for Locilex®.
 
We also believe our peptide is highly purified. The impurity levels of the API used in our commercial scale batch of Locilex® has been confirmed to be 99.4% pure for the API used in our cGMP batches.
 
In October 2013, we submitted our manufacturing data, including data from the first 30 kg cGMP batch as well as 18-month stability data on our 30 kg non-cGMP batch, to the FDA, and in December 2013 the FDA indicated in written communications with us that Locilex®’s stability and purity levels were acceptable for use in our Phase 3 studies. As a result of the aforementioned activities, we believe we have resolved the stability and purity concerns previously articulated by the FDA. We continued by preparing two additional cGMP batches of Locilex® and monitored stability over the past several years. In addition, we performed a scale up to a 140 kg batch size, filed relevant stability data with the FDA and used a portion of this scaled-up batch in our Phase 3 clinical trial program.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We hold rights to a U.S. patent covering our proprietary formulation of Locilex® and the method of using it for the treatment of skin and wound infections (U.S. Patent Number 8,530,409). This patent was granted in September 2013 and expires in the U.S. in June 2032. The patent incorporates discoveries made by Dow Pharmaceutical Sciences, Inc. (later acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.). The application which gave rise to U.S. Patent No. 8,520,409 was assigned to us in June 2013. In addition, we have filed a Patent Cooperation Treaty (or PCT) application claiming priority to U.S. Patent No. 8,520,409 that will allow us to seek corresponding protection outside of the U.S., including in Europe, Japan, China, Australia, and Korea, as well as in other PCT jurisdictions. We announced in February 2016 that patents were granted by patent offices in Australia and New Zealand and in March 2016 a patent was granted in Japan. In June 2016, July 2016, September 2016 and October 2016, we were notified that a patent was granted by the patent offices in Hong Kong, Europe, Korea and Israel, respectively. All of these newly issued patents provide patent protection into 2033. We anticipate completing the national stage patent prosecutions in other international regions throughout 2017.

In addition to this patent, we hold an exclusive sublicense to the composition-of-matter patent covering the pexiganan technology (U.S. Patent No. 5,912,231) which would have expired in June 2016 had we not filed an interim patent extension, not including any patent term extension that we expect to seek under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (or the Hatch-Waxman Act). We acquired this sublicense when we acquired the rights to Locilex® in April 2010. Our rights to practice the pexiganan technology are originally derived through a license agreement between Scripps Research Institute (or Scripps), the inventor of the pexiganan technology, and Multiple Peptide Systems, Inc. (or MPS). MPS then sublicensed the pexiganan technology to the prior sponsor of the pexiganan program. In October 1996, both of the license and sublicense agreements were amended by Scripps, MPS and the prior sponsor of Locilex® to confirm that the license and sublicense were fully-paid, royalty free and of indefinite duration, with no further economic obligations for the practice of the pexiganan technology. We filed an interim patent extension on the ’231 patent in June 2016 which was granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in June 2016.
 
Although U.S. Patent 5,912,231 supplements our existing intellectual property portfolio, we are chiefly reliant on our U.S. Patent 8,530,409, which covers the novel formulation and method of use for Locilex® and provides for substantially longer patent coverage than U.S. Patent 5,912,231. Further, U.S. Patent 8,530,409’s attributes as a topical formulation, its potentially broader scope of coverage and opportunity for foreign patent protection offer greater benefits to us than U.S. Patent 5,912,231. As such, we have not yet engaged in any discussions with Scripps regarding a possible patent term extension for U.S. Patent No. 5,912,231. If and when we decide to apply for an extension, we will we will need to work with Scripps throughout the application process to facilitate its approval.
  
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is characterized by intense competition, rapid product development and technological change. Competition is intense among manufacturers of prescription pharmaceuticals and other product areas where we may develop and market products in the future. Most of our competitors are large, well established pharmaceutical or healthcare companies with considerably greater financial, marketing, sales and technical resources than are available to us. Additionally, many of our competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow such competitors to develop new or improved products that may compete with Locilex® in a clinical setting that has yet to be identified. Our product could be rendered obsolete or made uneconomical by the development of new products to treat various acute bacterial skin infections even if Locilex® is proven to work in any such indications.
 
Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any one or more of such developments. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Even if Locilex® receives regulatory approval in a clinical indication other than mild infections of diabetic foot ulcers, of which there can be no assurance, our competitors’ drugs may be more effective, more effectively marketed and sold, or less costly than Locilex®, and may render our product obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing Locilex®.
 
In addition, some of our competitors have greater experience than we do in conducting preclinical and clinical trials and obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and other regulatory approvals. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA or other regulatory approvals for drug candidates more rapidly than we do. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory agency approvals and commence commercial sale of their drugs before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage. Locilex® therefore may not be commercially competitive with existing products or products under development. Competitors in the dermatology market generally include some very large international organizations such as Pfizer, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., and GlaxoSmithKline plc.
 
History of Locilex®
 
In August 1992, the prior sponsor of Locilex®, Magainin, submitted an initial Investigational New Drug (or IND) application for the prior formulation of Locilex® to study broad spectrum anti-infective activity for the treatment of superficial and complicated dermatological infections. Another IND was submitted in November 1993 to cover a new indication for the treatment of DFI. In the late 1990s, the prior sponsor tested the prior formulation of Locilex®, with over 1,000 human subjects exposed without safety concerns, including 835 evaluable patients in two Phase 3 clinical trials. The Phase 3 trial results showed that such prior formulation of topical Locilex® had an approximate 80% response rate measured as resolution or improvement in infection in patients who under today’s standards would be considered to have Mild or Moderate diabetic foot infections (or DFI).

The FDA Advisory Committee reviewing Locilex® at the time unanimously approved the safety of the product, but did not approve its efficacy and recommended an additional Phase 3 placebo controlled trial. In its 1999 non-approvable letter, the FDA identified certain cGMP manufacturing deficiencies, namely stability and quality control issues, and questions regarding the comparability of the product used in the Phase 3 program versus that which was produced at commercial scale. We believe that these hurdles and a lack of financing ultimately caused Magainin (later renamed Genaera Corporation) to deprioritize the product within their product pipeline. MacroChem Corporation (or MacroChem) licensed the technology in late 2007, after several years of attempting to remediate the manufacturing deficiencies. In February 2009, MacroChem was acquired by Access Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (or Access), which focused on oncology and oncology supportive care product candidates. Rights to Locilex® reverted to Genaera Liquidating Trust (established to sell the drug related assets of Genaera Corporation in liquidation) when Access failed to start a Phase 3 trial by the two-year anniversary of the effective date of the license agreement, triggering a termination right for Genaera Liquidating Trust in December 2009.
 
In April 2010, we acquired the worldwide rights to pexiganan, the API in Locilex®, and the prior formulation of the product and all related assets after participating in a public auction for the product conducted by Genaera Liquidating Trust. During the period between the FDA non-approval letter received in July 1999 and the second half of 2006, SmithKline Beecham Corporation (now part of GlaxoSmithKline plc) held the exclusive distribution rights to Locilex® in the U.S.
 
In March 2011, we exercised our exclusive option to buy out the downstream, success-based milestones and royalty obligations related to Locilex® and currently own 100% of our product candidate.
 
In 2015 and the first half of 2016, we successfully completed two Phase 1 clinical trials, a skin irritation trial and a skin sensitization trial, using Locilex® in healthy volunteers.
 
In October 2016, we reported that the OneStep-1 and OneStep-2 Phase 3 clinical trials failed to meet any of the primary or secondary endpoints. The OneStep trials were identical studies conducted simultaneously using Locilex® (versus placebo cream with standardized local wound care in both arms of each study) to treat patients with mild infections of diabetic foot ulcers.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Governmental authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application (or NDA) process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. and by the European Medicines Agency (or EMA) through the Marketing Authorisation Application (or MAA) process before they may be legally marketed in Europe. Our product candidates will be subject to similar requirements in other countries prior to marketing in those countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Government Regulation
 
NDA Approval Processes
 
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (or FDCA) and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process or approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:

• | refusal to approve pending applications;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | withdrawal of an approval;
--+---------------------------


• | imposition of a clinical hold;
--+-------------------------------


• | warning letters;
--+-----------------


• | product seizures;
--+------------------


• | total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions, fines, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
 

• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices (or GLPs) or other applicable regulations; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices (or GCPs) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current cGMPs to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 
Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical or nonclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the nonclinical studies, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy determination. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the IND on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND, and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND.
 
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must timely report to FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigation brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. An institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject’s legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

• | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. Clinical trials are performed on a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Human clinical trials are inherently uncertain and Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be successfully completed. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support the approval of the new drug. If a Phase 2 clinical trial is the subject of discussion at the end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, a sponsor may be able to request a SPA, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim.
 
According to published guidance on the SPA process, a sponsor which meets the prerequisites may make a specific request for a SPA and provide information regarding the design and size of the proposed clinical trial. The FDA is supposed to evaluate the protocol within 45 days of the request to assess whether the proposed trial is adequate, and that evaluation may result in discussions and a request for additional information. A SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the record. The agreement will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug was identified after the testing began.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies and also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf-life.
 
The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests and other control mechanisms, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees, but a waiver of such fees may be obtained under specified circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
 
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. NDAs receive either standard or priority review. A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review. The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured and tested. We anticipate that our NDA submission, which may technically be classified as an amended NDA (a so-called Class II resubmission), will address the manufacturing concerns previously articulated by the FDA regarding the prior formulation of Locilex®. Should our NDA be accepted for review, the FDA is supposed to respond within six months of submission.
 
Recent Changes to the Regulatory Landscape for Anti-Infective Drugs
 
The analytic approach of the FDA’s Anti-Infective Drugs Division has undergone evolution in recent years, primarily driven by concerns that increasingly less effective antibiotics may have been approved in the last 10 to 15 years. The impact of these changes was a rethinking of how antibiotic efficacy is measured in clinical trials, and a review of the statistical tools used to analyze the data. In March 2009, the FDA published a draft guidance entitled “Guidance for Industry Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia: Developing Drugs for Treatment” and in August 2010, it published draft guidance (subsequently published as final guidance in October 2013) entitled “Guidance for Industry Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections: Developing Drugs for Treatment” (or 2010 Guidance). The purpose of this guidance was to address many of the uncertainties regarding what the FDA expected from sponsors and clinical trials for the indications of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.

The FDA asked sponsors to include additional measurements in their evaluation of efficacy that the FDA believes are more objective and less susceptible to interpretation by investigators. Non-inferiority comparisons of drugs are the standards for antibiotics, and non-inferiority margins are the margins used in the statistical analysis comparing two treatment arms in a study. These are the statistical margins or rules used to distinguish the degree of potential difference between two antibiotics in a study. In September 2010, one month after issuing the 2010 Guidance, the FDA approved the first antibiotic NDA reviewed pursuant to these new endpoints and non-inferiority margins. The clinical protocol that was reviewed by the FDA in support of our SPA with the FDA includes provisions that are consistent with the 2010 Guidance, as well as the FDA’s final guidance published in October 2013.
 
Expedited Review and Approval
 
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for the approval of a drug on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten months.
 
Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval, which is described in Subpart H of 21 CFR Part 314, provides for an earlier approval for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that fills an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. A surrogate endpoint is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials.
 
In the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (or FDASIA), which was signed into law in July 2012, Congress encouraged the FDA to utilize innovative and flexible approaches to the assessment of products under accelerated approval. The law required the FDA to issue related draft guidance within a year after the law’s enactment and also promulgate confirming regulatory changes. In June 2013, the FDA published a draft Guidance for Industry entitled, “Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions—Drugs and Biologics” which provides guidance on FDA programs that are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs as well as threshold criteria generally applicable to concluding that a drug is a candidate for these expedited development and review programs. In addition to the Fast Track, accelerated approval and priority review programs discussed above, the FDA also provided guidance on a new program for Breakthrough Therapy designation. A request for Breakthrough Therapy designation should be submitted concurrently with, or as an amendment to an IND. FDA has already granted this designation to around 30 new drugs and recently approved a couple of Breakthrough Therapy designated drug.
 
Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA.

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (or ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
Post-approval Requirements
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
 
Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things:
 

• | record-keeping requirements;
--+-----------------------------


• | reporting of adverse experiences with the drug;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | drug sampling and distribution requirements;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements.

Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws.
 
We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct.
 
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 
Regulation Outside of the U.S.
 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to regulations of other countries governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the E.U., before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 
Under E.U. regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders or diabetes and optional for those medicines which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all E.U. member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessments report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 
Reimbursement
 
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (or MMA) imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (or collectively, the ACA), enacted in March 2010, is expected to have a significant impact on the health care industry. ACA is expected to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA is expected to expand and increase industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. We cannot predict the impact of the ACA on pharmaceutical companies, as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions which has not yet occurred. In addition, some members of the U.S. Congress have been seeking to overturn at least portions of the legislation and we expect they will continue to review and assess this legislation and alternative health care reform proposals. Any legal challenges to the ACA, as well as Congressional efforts to repeal the ACA, add to the uncertainty of the legislative changes enacted as part of the ACA.
 
In addition, in some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the E.U. provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the E.U. do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to be significantly lower.
