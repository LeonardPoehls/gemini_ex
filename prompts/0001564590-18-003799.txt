Spinoff Transactions
 On October 1, 2016, we completed the separation of our financial communications and data services business (“Donnelley Financial Solutions, Inc.” or “Donnelley Financial”) and our publishing and retail-centric print services and office products business (“LSC Communications, Inc.” or “LSC”) into two separate publicly-traded companies (the “Separation”). We completed the tax free distribution of approximately 26.2 million shares, or 80.75%, of the outstanding common stock of each of Donnelley Financial and LSC, to RRD stockholders (the “Distribution”). The Distribution was made to RRD stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 23, 2016, who received one share of Donnelley Financial common stock and one share of LSC common stock for every eight shares of RRD common stock held as of the record date. As a result of the Distribution, Donnelley Financial and LSC are now independent public companies trading under the symbols “DFIN” and “LKSD”, respectively, on the New York Stock Exchange. Immediately following the Distribution and as of December 31, 2016, we held approximately 6.2 million shares of Donnelley Financial common stock and approximately 6.2 million shares of LSC common stock. 
 In March 2017, we sold the approximately 6.2 million shares of LSC common stock retained by us and used the proceeds to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the Company’s then-existing credit facility. In June 2017 and August 2017, we exchanged our approximately 6.2 million shares of Donnelley Financial common stock for certain outstanding senior indebtedness of the Company, which obligations were subsequently cancelled and discharged upon delivery to the Company. As of December 31, 2017, we no longer held any shares of the common stock of either Donnelley Financial or LSC. 
 The financial results of Donnelley Financial and LSC for periods prior to the Distribution are presented as discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Additionally, sales from RRD to Donnelley Financial and LSC previously eliminated in consolidation have been recast and are now shown as external sales of RRD within the financial results of continuing operations. See Note 2, Discontinued Operations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Business Acquisition and Dispositions
 On August 4, 2016, we acquired Precision Dialogue, a provider of email marketing, direct mail marketing and other services with operations in the United States.
 On January 11, 2016, we sold two entities within the business process outsourcing reporting unit.
 On April 29, 2015, we sold our 50.1% interest in our Venezuelan operating entity.
 For further information on the above acquisition and dispositions, see Note 3, Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Competitive Environment
 Our clients operate in an evolving and ever-changing market. While the market is large and fragmented, there are tremendous changes occurring in how organizations need to create, manage, deliver and measure their communications. Some of the key factors facing our clients include regulatory changes, sensitivity to economic conditions, raw material pricing volatility and USPS actions. In addition, technological changes, including the electronic distribution of documents and data, online distribution and hosting of media content, and advances in digital printing, print-on-demand and internet technologies, continue to impact the market for some of our products and services, such as statement printing and forms. 
 We work with our clients to create, manage, deliver and optimize their multichannel communications strategies by providing innovative solutions to meet increasing customer demands in light of the large and evolving marketplace. One of our competitive strengths is that we offer a wide array of communications products and services, including print and content management, which provide differentiated solutions for our clients. We are also able to manage the storage and distribution of products for our clients by offering warehousing and inventory management solutions that allow clients to store printed materials and to efficiently ship them using our platform. Our logistics operations offer our clients access to our proprietary technology that is designed to determine the most efficient and cost-effective method of shipping depending on our clients’ needs. We believe our breadth of offerings provides us with a distinct competitive advantage. We have and will continue to develop and expand our creative and design, content management, digital and print production, supply chain management and distribution services to address our clients’ evolving needs while supporting the strategic objective of becoming a leading global provider of integrated communication products and services. 
 The print and related services industry, in general, continues to have excess capacity and remains highly competitive and fragmented. 
 We believe that, across our range of products and services, competition is based primarily on quality and the ability to service the special needs of clients at a competitive price. Therefore, we believe we need to continue to differentiate our product and service offerings and aggressively manage our cost structure to remain competitive.
 6


We also operate in a highly competitive and fragmented market for commercial freight transportation and third-party logistics services. Primary competitors to our services include other national non-asset based third-party logistics companies, as well as regional or niche freight brokerages, asset-based carriers offering brokerage and/or logistics services, wholesale intermodal transportation service providers and rail carriers. In addition, we may from time to time compete against carriers’ internal sales forces or shippers’ internal transportation departments.
 Seasonality 
 Advertising and consumer spending trends affect demand in several of the end-markets we serve. As such, we have some seasonality in the second half of the year in our business, despite the breadth of our product and service offerings.
Raw Materials 
 The primary raw materials we use in our print businesses are paper and ink. We negotiate with leading suppliers to maximize our purchasing efficiencies. Some of the paper we use is supplied directly by clients. Variations in the cost and supply of certain paper grades and ink formulations used in the manufacturing process may affect the Company’s consolidated financial results. Paper prices fluctuated during 2017 and volatility in the future is expected. Generally, clients directly absorb the impact of changing prices on client-supplied paper. With respect to paper we purchase, we have historically passed most changes in price through to our clients. We believe contractual arrangements and industry practice will support our continued ability to pass on any future paper price increases, but there is no assurance that market conditions will continue to enable us to successfully do so. We believe that the paper supply is consolidating, and there may be shortfalls in the future in supplies necessary to meet the demands of the entire marketplace. Higher paper prices and tight paper supplies may have an impact on clients’ demand for printed products. We have undertaken various strategic initiatives to mitigate any foreseeable supply disruptions with respect to our ink requirements.
 We continue to monitor the impact of changes in the price of crude oil and other energy costs, which impact our ink suppliers, logistics operations and manufacturing costs. Crude oil, energy prices and market cost of transportation continue to be volatile. We believe our logistics operations will continue to be able to pass a substantial portion of any increases in fuel prices directly to our clients in order to offset the impact of related cost increases. Decreases in fuel prices are also passed on to clients which negatively impact sales and income from operations. However, our logistics operations is restricted in its ability to pass on increased cost of transportation costs to some clients in the short term. Therefore, increases in the market cost of transportation will negatively impact income from operations. We generally cannot pass on to clients the impact of higher energy prices on our manufacturing costs. We cannot predict sudden changes in energy prices and the impact that possible future changes in energy prices might have upon either future operating costs or client demand or the related impact either will have on our consolidated annual results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
 Distribution 
 Our products are distributed to end-users through U.S. and foreign postal services, through retail channels, electronically or by direct shipment to client facilities. Through our logistics operations, we manage the distribution of most client products we print in the U.S. and Canada to maximize efficiency and reduce costs for clients.
 As a leading provider of print logistics and among the largest mailers of marketing mail in the U.S., we work closely with our clients and the USPS to offer innovative products and mail preparation services to minimize postage costs. While we do not directly absorb the impact of higher postal rates on our clients’ mailings, demand for products distributed through the U.S. or foreign postal services has been negatively impacted by increases in postal rates, as postal costs are a significant component of many clients’ cost structures. 
 On January 22, 2017, the USPS implemented a CPI based postage increase of approximately 1.0%, as allowed under postal law, entitled the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (“PAEA”). 
 In addition, there is a pending bi-partisan legislative proposal (still in Committee) agreed to on March 16, 2017 that seeks to stabilize the financial condition of the USPS, which among other things calls for levying a 2.15% increase on market-dominant mail products. Nevertheless, the Postal Regulatory Commission (“PRC”) on November 6, 2017 adjusted and approved a USPS filing for a CPI based average price increases of 1.9% to 2.0% depending on the class of mail, which became effective January 21, 2018.
  Additionally, as required by PAEA, the PRC initiated a comprehensive review of PAEA on December 20, 2016, to determine if the current system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products is still achieving the original objectives of the law. On December 1, 2017, the PRC issued its findings and concluded that the current system was not meeting all of PAEA’s original objectives. To remedy this situation, the PRC has proposed recommendations, which among other things, allows the Postal Service flexibility of “CPI + 2%” on market-dominant mail products for a 5 year period of time. The PRC has asked for industry stakeholder input, comments and alternative suggestions to these recommendations which are due by March 1, 2018. This will be followed by a reply comment period ending March 30, 2018. The impact of these actions cannot currently be estimated.

Mail delivery services through the USPS accounted for approximately 29% of the revenue within our logistics reporting unit during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
 Clients
 We have more than 50,000 clients worldwide, including 99% of the Fortune 100, 96% of the Fortune 500 and 89% of the Fortune 1000. Our services enable some of the world’s largest companies to create, manage and deliver comprehensive and cost-effective multi-channel communications around the world. In connection with the Separation, we entered into a number of agreements with LSC and Donnelley Financial with respect to our ongoing commercial relationships. For the year ended December 31, 2017, LSC and Donnelley Financial accounted for 10.1% of total net sales in our Strategic Services segment. For each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, no single client accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated net sales.
 Technology, Research and Development 
 We invest in technology and research and development as a key strategy for our business. We believe that investing in new technologies allows us to remain on the forefront of content management and data analytics, while also allowing us to support our clients’ growing utilization of digital and print technologies. In addition, these technologies help expand our capabilities to provide additional services to clients as customers’ needs evolve. We have a research facility in Grand Island, New York, that supports the development and implementation of new technologies to meet client needs and improve operating efficiencies. We believe that proprietary technology is required where it will provide a competitive advantage or where the desired technology is not readily available in the marketplace, and as such, our proprietary technology portfolio contains an array of applications and technological capabilities which are developed to perform different functions, including digital ink jet printing. Our cost for research and development activities is not material to our consolidated annual results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In addition, while we consider our patent portfolio to be valuable, the Company does not believe that our business is dependent upon any single patent or group of patents. We actively monitor the registrations of our trademark and patent portfolio to ensure that our intellectual property is appropriately protected and maintained.
Cybersecurity 
 Our cybersecurity program is designed to meet the needs and expectations of our clients who entrust us with highly sensitive information. Furthermore, our healthcare and insurance printing businesses are subject to industry-specific data regulations, including the Health Care Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which could subject us and our clients to liability should sensitive customer or patient information be publicly disclosed. Our infrastructure and technology, expansive and highly trained global workforce and comprehensive security and compliance program make us qualified to safely process, store and protect customer information to ensure compliance with relevant regulations. 
 Our infrastructure and technology security capabilities are bolstered by our relationship with a leading data center services provider. Furthermore, our networks are monitored by intrusion detection services around the clock, and our systems and applications are routinely tested for vulnerabilities and are operated under a strict patch management program. 
 We employ a highly skilled IT workforce to implement our cybersecurity programs and to handle specific security responsibilities. As a result of annual mandatory security awareness training, our IT workforce is qualified to address security and compliance-related issues as they arise. Additionally, all of our IT employees are carefully screened, undergo a thorough background check and are bound by a nondisclosure agreement that details such employee’s security and legal responsibilities with regard to information handling. 
 The Company believes our security and compliance team diminishes the risk of system compromise and data exposure by rapidly and effectively addressing security incidents as they arise.
 Environmental Compliance 
 It is our policy to conduct our global operations in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and other requirements. It is not possible to quantify with certainty the impact of potential failures regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that the Company may undertake in the future. However, in management’s opinion, compliance with the present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated annual results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, the Company had 42,700 employees. 
 As of December 31, 2017, 438 of our U.S. employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements at twelve of our U.S. facilities, representing 2.5% of our U.S. workforce. We have collective bargaining agreements with unionized employees in China, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Chile and Europe. We have not experienced a work stoppage during the past five years. Management believes that our relationships with our employees and collective bargaining groups are good.
