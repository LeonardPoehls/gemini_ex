Business development and strategy
Prior to February 2014, our only mine was Fire Creek and since that time we have experienced growth in our annual gold and silver production, total assets, and workforce largely due to growth at Fire Creek and the acquisitions outlined below:

Acquisitions: | Midas | | True North(1) | Hollister and Aurora(1) | | Ogama-Rockland | Total
Date acquired: | February 11, 2014 | | January 22, 2016 | October 3, 2016 | | October 19, 2017 | 
Purchase consideration (thousands): | $ | 63,645 | | $ | 31,100 | | $ | 109,568 | $ | 7,271 | $ | 211,584
(1) Refer to Note 4. Business Combinations to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.

The acquisition of Midas included a mine and a mill. Once Midas was acquired we began processing Fire Creek's ore, together with Midas' ore, at the Midas mill, which is located approximately 120 miles away from Fire Creek. Hollister began production in 2017 and the processing of its ore is also being done at the Midas mill, which is located approximately 17 miles away from Hollister. True North has a mill and processes its ore on-site. The Ogama-Rockland assets include exploration stage properties located 30 kilometers or approximately 19 miles from the True North mine and mill and have an inferred resource of 337,000 gold equivalent ounces ("GEOs"). The Company anticipates producing from this property in the future and it is expected that material from Ogama-Rockland would be processed at the True North mill. 
During 2017, our producing mines were Fire Creek, Midas, Hollister and True North, and in 2018 we expect to produce from these same mines. True North will be placed on care and maintenance status, however, the Company will continue to process tailings, as contained in its reserve estimate, through the mill for the foreseeable future. Refer to the 2018 Full Year Outlook section of Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") for a summary of our expected 2018 production volumes, costs, capital, development, and exploration expenditures. 
Gold and silver sales represent 100% of our revenues and the market prices of gold and silver significantly impact our financial position, operating results, and cash flows. Our primary strategy is to increase shareholder value by responsibly achieving our production, cost, and capital targets while attempting to extend our mine lives through development and exploration programs and reducing our costs through operational efficiencies. We also consider acquisitions or other arrangements in the normal course which strategically fit our future growth objectives. We have an experienced management team and high-quality assets located in mining-friendly jurisdictions.

Principal products and market overview
Principal products and revenues
During 2017, our principal products were produced at Fire Creek, Midas, Hollister and True North and consisted of gold and silver doré bars which were sent to a third-party refiner to produce bullion that met the required market standards of 99.95% pure gold and 99.90% pure silver before being sold to financial institutions and precious metals traders. Under the terms of our refining agreements, doré bars are refined for a fee, and the separately-recovered gold and silver ounces are credited to our account or, at our instruction, delivered to our buyers' accounts. 
In 2017, 2016, and 2015, revenues from gold and silver made up 93.0% and 7.0%, 87.1% and 12.9%, and 82.6% and 17.4%, respectively, of our total revenue and, as such, we currently consider gold to be our principal product. We expect gold and silver sales to be our only source of future revenues. The following charts provide details about our ounces sold and associated revenues for the last three years (revenue labels within bars in millions):
The following charts provide details about the percentage of revenue by site for the last three years:
Principal product uses and prices
Generally, gold and silver have two main categories of use: fabrication and investment. Fabricated precious metals have a variety of end uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial, decorative, medals, medallions, and coins. Investors buy gold and silver bullion, coins, and jewelry as investments. Gold prices and silver prices are volatile and are affected by many factors beyond our control, such as sales or purchases by central banks and financial institutions, inflation or deflation and monetary policies, fluctuation

in the value of the US dollar and foreign currencies, global and regional demand, and political and economic conditions of countries throughout the world. 
The following table presents the annual high, low, and average afternoon fixing prices for gold and silver over the past three years on the London Bullion Market ("LBMA") compared to our average realized sales prices (in U.S. dollars per ounce):

 | Gold | | Silver
Year | High | | Low | | Average | | High | Low | | Average
2015 LBMA | $ | 1,296 | | | $ | 1,049 | | $ | 1,160 | | | $ | 18.23 | | $ | 13.71 | $ | 15.68
2015 Klondex Average | | | | | 1,156 | | | | | | 15.72 | 
2016 LBMA | 1,366 | | | 1,077 | | | 1,251 | | 20.71 | | | 13.58 | | 17.14 | 
2016 Klondex Average | | | | | 1,245 | | | | | | 17.44 | 
2017 LBMA | 1,346 | | | 1,151 | | | 1,257 | | 18.56 | | | 15.22 | | 17.05 | 
2017 Klondex Average | | | | | 1,263 | | | | | | 17.23 | 

On March 9, 2018, the afternoon fixing prices for gold and silver on the London Bullion Market were $1,321 per ounce and $16.49 per ounce, respectively.
Major customers
We have historically sold our metal to five customers. Because our metal is refined to produce bullion that meets the required market standards, we believe the loss of any one of our customers would not adversely affect our ability to sell due to the liquidity of gold and silver markets and the availability of alternative trading counterparties. See Note 18. Segment information to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a listing of revenues by customer. 
Employees and contractors
None of our employees are represented by unions. The estimated number of employees and contractors employed by us as at December 31, 2017 was as follows: 

Segment | Employees | Contractors | | Total
Fire Creek | 97 | | 32 | | 129
Midas (including mill) | 128 | | 81 | | 209
Hollister | 72 | | 57 | | 129
Aurora | 12 | | — | | 12 
True North | 186 | | 139 | | 325
Corporate and other | 60 | | — | | 60 
Total | 555 | | 309 | | 864

True North will be placed on care and maintenance status, however, the Company will continue to process tailings, as such, the Company expects to see a reduction in both employees and contractors in the first quarter of 2018.
Competition
We compete with other mining companies that operate in a general proximity to our mines, some of which are larger and better capitalized, for skilled employees and contractors residing in small communities like Winnemucca, Nevada, Elko, Nevada, and Bissett, Manitoba, Canada. Our principal methods of competition are described under the sub-heading "Other Risks" in the "Risk Factors" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although we have not historically experienced such, material shortages of skilled employees could lead to production inefficiencies and/or additional costs. 
From time-to-time, certain production inputs have been in short supply. Shortages of production supplies and raw materials rarely lead to operational issues, but would require us to either substitute with lower quality supplies or to ship these supplies from longer distances. These substitutions and changes could result in production inefficiencies and/or additional costs. To date, we have not experienced any material shortages in production inputs.
Mine safety and health
Despite high-levels of health and safety performance, our philosophy is one of "continuous improvement" combined with a belief that "the miner is the most important thing to come out of a mine." We have mandatory mine safety and health programs that include employee and contractor training, risk management, workplace inspection, emergency response, accident investigation and program auditing. We consider these programs to be essential at all levels to ensure that our employees, contractors, and visitors operate safely.

During 2017, we had one lost-time injury at True North. As of December 31, 2017, we had operated 1,903 days (~5.2 years) at Fire Creek, 1,182 days (~3.2 years) at Midas, 53 days (~0.1 years) at True North, and 454 days (~1.2 years) at Hollister and Aurora, without a lost-time injury.
Our United States operations and exploration properties are subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”). MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. The Dodd-Frank Act requires us to provide a mine safety disclosure, which we have done in Exhibit 95.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government regulation of mining-related activities
Government and environmental regulation
Our exploration and development activities are subject to various national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in the United States and Canada, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our exploration and development programs. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and regulations in the United States and Canada. For a more detailed discussion of the various government laws and regulations applicable to our operations and potential negative effects of these laws and regulations, see section Item 1A. Risk Factors - Environmental and Regulatory Risks, below.
