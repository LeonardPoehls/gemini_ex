ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview

Shutterfly, Inc. ("Shutterfly") was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1999. In September 2006, we completed our initial public offering and our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “SFLY.” Our principal corporate offices are in Redwood City, California.
We are the leading digital retailer and manufacturer of high-quality personalized products and services. Our purpose is to share life’s joy by connecting people to what matters as the leading retailer and manufacturing platform for personalized products. We provide a full range of personalized photo-based products and services that make it easy, convenient and fun for consumers to upload, edit, enhance, organize, find, share, create, print, and preserve their memories in a creative and thoughtful manner.
Our high-quality products and services and the compelling experience we create for our customers, combined with our focus on continuous innovation, have allowed us to establish premium brands. We realize the benefits of premium brands through high customer loyalty, low customer acquisition costs and premium pricing. Our trusted premium brands are:
Shutterfly leads the industry in personalized photo products and services. Shutterfly helps our customers turn their precious memories into lasting keepsakes with award-winning professionally-bound photo books, cards and stationery, custom home décor products and unique photo gifts as well as calendars and prints. 
The Tiny Prints boutique offers premium cards and stationery, stylish announcements, invitations and personal stationery. The Tiny Prints boutique provides customers exclusive luxe designs curated from top stationery designers. Customers (celebrities and top designers alike) seek us out for our industry-leading designs and exceptional service. 
BorrowLenses is the premier online marketplace for high-quality photographic and video equipment rentals.
Groovebook is an iPhone and Android app and subscription service that prints up to 100 mobile phone photos in a Groovebook and mails it to customers every month.
Shutterfly Business Solutions (SBS) provides personalized direct marketing and other end-consumer communications as well as just-in-time, inventory-free printing for our business customers.
We generate most of our revenues by marketing and manufacturing a variety of products such as cards and stationery, professionally-bound photo books, personalized gifts and home décor, calendars and high-quality prints. We manufacture many of these items in our Fort Mill, South Carolina; Shakopee, Minnesota; and Tempe, Arizona production facilities. By operating our own production facilities, we can produce high-quality products, innovate rapidly, maintain a favorable cost structure and ensure timely shipment to customers, even during peak periods of demand. We also operate a network of partners and can seamlessly manage demand across it. Some of the products that are currently manufactured for us by third parties include calendars, mugs, ornaments, candles, pillows and blankets.

Substantially all our revenue is generated from sales originating in the United States and our sales cycle has historically been highly seasonal as approximately 50% of our total net revenues occur during our fiscal fourth quarter. Further, our Tiny Prints 
4

boutique generates approximately 70% of its revenue in the fourth quarter. Our operations and financial performance depend on general economic conditions in the United States, consumer sentiment, and the levels of consumer discretionary spending. We closely monitor these economic measures as their trends are indicators of the health of the overall economy and are some of the key external factors that impact our business.
Our customers are a central part of our business model. They generate most of the content on our service by uploading their photos and storing their memories. In addition, they share their photos electronically with their friends and families, extending and endorsing our brand and creating a sense of community. Finally, by giving our branded products to colleagues, friends and loved ones throughout the year, customers reinforce our brands. Through these various activities, our customers create a network of new users and customers.
In addition to driving lower customer acquisition costs through multiple marketing channels, our users provide input on new features, functionalities and products. Close, frequent customer interactions, coupled with significant investments in sophisticated integrated marketing programs, enable us to fine-tune and tailor our promotions and website presentation to specific customer segments. Consequently, customers are presented with a highly personalized shopping experience, which helps foster a unique and deep relationship with our brands.
To successfully execute our strategies, we require a talented leadership team. As a result, we intend to continue our focus to attract, retain, and grow our team; and to build continuity and pursue executional excellence in our daily operations everywhere. By providing our employees with a great place to work, we believe that we continue to strengthen our high-performance culture. 
On January 30, 2018, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Lifetouch, Inc. (“Lifetouch”) and Lifetouch Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Trust (the “Seller”), pursuant to which we will acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Lifetouch from the Seller. The consummation of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval among other conditions. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the consideration for the acquisition will consist of an all-cash purchase price of $825.0 million subject to certain post-closing adjustments based on a determination of closing net working capital, transaction expenses, cash and indebtedness. We expect to close the acquisition in the second quarter of 2018 and will finance the all-cash purchase price with an incremental $825.0 million term loan issuance. In connection with the Purchase Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter (the "Commitment Letter"), dated as of January 30, 2018, with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. ("Morgan Stanley"), pursuant to which Morgan Stanley has committed to provide a secured incremental term loan facility in an aggregate amount of $825.0 million under our existing credit agreement. Issuance of the secured incremental term loan is subject to various conditions, including the execution of the definitive documentation and other customary closing conditions. 
Lifetouch provides Shutterfly with a highly complementary business. We expect to gain access to many Lifetouch customers as Shutterfly customers, where they will benefit from Shutterfly’s leading cloud-photo management service, product creation capabilities, mobile apps, and broad product range. Lifetouch will be able to offer Shutterfly’s broader product range to Lifetouch customers, as well as to accelerate the development of Lifetouch’s online order-taking platform. We also expect to realize significant supply chain, manufacturing, and fulfillment synergies over time. 
During the first quarter of 2017, the Board of Directors approved, committed to and initiated a plan to significantly simplify the Consumer business during 2017 ("2017 Restructuring Plan"). As part of the plan, the following actions were taken:

• | During the second quarter of 2017, we shut down the legacy Tiny Prints website and reinvested in Tiny Prints as our premium cards & stationery brand, creating a Tiny Prints boutique on a dedicated tab on Shutterfly.com;


• | During the second quarter, the MyPublisher brand was retired in favor of the industry-leading Shutterfly Photo Books category; and


• | During the third quarter of 2017, we launched the new Shutterfly Wedding Shop and shut down the Wedding Paper Divas legacy website. The Shutterfly Wedding Shop is a broad offering of personalized wedding products, including invitations, stationery, gifts, keepsakes and albums.

As of December 31, 2017, we substantially completed all actions under the 2017 Restructuring Plan. The Tiny Prints, MyPublisher and Wedding Paper Divas legacy websites were shut down during the first nine months of 2017. We planned to retain as many customers and as much revenue as possible while migrating customers from the legacy websites to Shutterfly.com and were successful in doing so. Further, as part of the plan, we announced that we would undertake a strategic review of BorrowLenses for possible sale. We completed the strategic review process in the third quarter of 2017 and decided to retain and operate the business. Total restructuring costs associated with the 2017 Restructuring Plan were $16.8 million and impacted our restructuring 
5

expense line items within cost of net revenues and operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations, as these were incurred during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.
During the second quarter of 2017, we took advantage of an opportunity to complete the upgrade of the majority of our color printer fleet. The benefits of the upgrade include improved quality, increased throughput and automation, and lower consumable costs. We expect the new equipment to result in approximately $15.0 million in expense savings over the next five years. There are three pieces of this transaction as follows:
•Purchase of leased equipment from an existing vendor for $21.6 million;
•Sale of the purchased leased equipment to HP, Inc. ("HP") for $20.5 million; and
•Lease of new equipment from HP.
In the purchase of the existing leased equipment, the difference between the payment of $21.6 million and the fair value of the asset resulted in an $8.1 million capital lease termination charge (a separate line item in the consolidated statement of operations). The purchased equipment assets were recorded on the balance sheet at fair value of $12.9 million. The subsequent sale of the equipment to HP for $20.5 million resulted in the removal of the equipment assets and a capital lease incentive of $7.9 million to be amortized over the new lease term. Lastly, we leased new equipment from HP which upgraded most of our remaining color fleet to HP's high-end printers. 
Segment Information
Our reportable segments are Consumer, Shutterfly Business Solutions ("SBS").
Consumer
Our Consumer revenues include sales from all our brands and are derived from the sale of a variety of products such as, professionally-bound photo books, cards and stationery, custom home décor products and unique photo gifts, calendars and prints, and related shipping revenues, as well as rental revenue from our BorrowLenses brand. Revenue from advertising displayed on our websites is also included in Consumer revenues. Consumer revenues as a percentage of total net revenues were 84% in 2017, 88% in 2016 and 91% in 2015.
SBS
Our SBS revenues are primarily from personalized direct marketing and other end-consumer communications as well as just-in-time, inventory-free printing for our business customers. We target the financial, retail, technology and health care verticals primarily with our direct sales team. With the help of our leading manufacturing platform, we are building a scalable SBS platform that enables any of our clients to optimize their integrated marketing campaigns. We continue to focus our efforts in expanding our presence in these industries. SBS revenues as a percentage of total net revenues were 16% in 2017, 12% in 2016 and 9% in 2015.
In addition to the above reportable segments, we have a corporate category that includes activities that are not directly attributable or allocable to a specific segment. This category consists of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets.
For financial information about each segment, see Part II, Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10-K, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Basis of Presentation” and Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 13-Segment Reporting.” For a discussion of the operational risks associated with each business segment, see Part I, Item 1A of this annual report on Form 10-K, “Risk Factors.”
Business Initiatives
Consumer
During the first quarter of 2017, we announced a restructuring of our Consumer business over the course of 2017, simplifying our brand portfolio, creating a Tiny Prints boutique on a dedicated tab on Shutterfly.com, and shutting down the legacy Tiny Prints, Wedding Paper Divas, and MyPublisher websites while encouraging those customers to migrate to Shutterfly.com. We anticipated that a transition of this magnitude would inevitably lead to the loss of some customers and revenues and sought to minimize the 
6

impact through investments in a simple migration process, in a great new home for Tiny Prints on Shutterfly.com, in further differentiating Tiny Prints as a premium brand, and in clear customer communications. 
We completed all actions under the Restructuring Plan during 2017 and as a result, the Tiny Prints, MyPublisher and Wedding Paper Divas legacy websites were shut down during 2017. We were pleased to see that premium features of the Tiny Prints boutique resonated with customers, and encouraged that customers migrating from the legacy websites significantly increased their purchases of Shutterfly-brand products.
During 2017, we continued to make progress on our mobile app. We launched more than 40 new products in the app during 2017, while improving and simplifying in-app creation. We now have products from all our categories available in the app. We also improved and simplified the in-app creation experiences for Personalized Gifts, Home Décor, and Photo Books categories with more styles, designs, layouts and text options. In 2017, the percentage of revenues coming from mobile sources for the Shutterfly brand increased to 23% from 18% in 2016 and 13% in 2015. We continued to see a high install-to-first order ratio and attractive customer acquisition costs, with customers acquired via the mobile app having a superior return on investment ("ROI") versus customers acquired via desktop browser. 
We’re also proud of our execution against technology and manufacturing, with significant year-over-year improvements in the speed and availability of our site, apps, and upload experiences. For example, the homepage of Shutterfly.com loaded twice as quickly this year as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Our manufacturing platform set new records for quality, delivery speed, and customer service, benefiting from the platform consolidation, process improvements, and equipment upgrades. 
We continued to launch new physical products in 2017, including new products in the Personalized Gifts and Home Décor category, in addition to launching new products and designs in Photo Books, Cards and Stationery, and our Wedding category. Our Personalized Gifts and Home Décor category continued to gain traction with customers, growing at a double-digit rate year-over-year. 
To support our business strategies within the Consumer segment, we use a variety of integrated marketing programs, including strategic marketing partnerships, e-mail marketing to prospects and existing customers, search engine marketing ("SEM"), search engine optimization ("SE"), affiliate marketing, display advertising, traditional direct marketing mailings such as postcards and seasonal catalogs, print advertising and other broadcast media. In addition, because many of our products are either shared over the Internet or given as gifts, the appearance of our brands on the products and packaging provides ongoing advertising. 
 Throughout 2017, we deployed dozens of highly integrated channel campaigns with a balance of direct response and brand awareness that enabled the company to reach new levels of brand awareness and engagement. During 2017, we entered into a philanthropic partnership with the Make-a-Wish Foundation. Further, our philanthropic partnership with The Ellen Show entered its sixth season in 2017 and we also launched new partnerships with other category leaders. Lastly, we continue to work closely with our key advertising partners to participate in new programs.
During 2017, we signed a multi-year deal with Amazon Web Services, Inc. ("AWS") to migrate our data to the cloud. This deal positions us to benefit from a cost-effective solution to scaling compared to the outlook from remaining in our own data center, enabling us to deliver innovative features and improve customer experience. Beyond anticipated cost savings, we expect to see benefits from higher developer productivity and speed of innovation.
SBS
In 2017, SBS delivered strong performance through automation and more focused sales. We were successful in winning follow-on contracts from our existing key clients where our ability to execute on personalized print and digital communications at scale resulted in additional programs and volumes. As such, we signed a major multi-year deal with an existing technology client in 2017 and we continue to focus on obtaining additional new customers as well as deepening our existing relationships. 
We believe customers are coming to SBS because we provide value at a level much above a traditional printer. We are an integrated marketing partner and with the help of our leading manufacturing platform, we are building a scalable SBS platform that enables any of our clients to optimize their integrated marketing campaigns. We believe our platform investments will further differentiate SBS and position us to capitalize on an important new industry opportunity.
Strategy
7

Our vision is strongly motivated by the belief that sustainable growth comes from innovating on behalf of customers over the long term. We have four key areas of strategic focus:

• | Make purchasing personalized products simple

Our goal is to improve and over time radically simplify every aspect of the creation and purchase process. We plan to continue to build on the progress we have already made in simplifying the creation and purchase of personalized products, focusing on personalization and targeting across the entire customer journey, ranging from personalized marketing using the customer’s most relevant photographs, to highly targeted promotions, to products automatically created for customers. We plan to upgrade our entire suite of marketing tools and platforms in the first half of 2018, implementing best-in-class third-party platforms, improving our promotional tools to allow more flexible and targeted promotions, building expanded up-sell and cross-sell capabilities, increasing our use of machine-learning-based targeting algorithms, and continuing to expand automated product creation. At the same time, we’ll continue to focus on improving speed and availability. And, as we work towards that long-term vision, we will seek to improve the customer experience we offer today to decrease friction, increase speed, and continue to inspire our customers.

• | Offer customers a broader range of products

Throughout Shutterfly’s history, category expansion and new product launches have been one of the most reliable drivers of growth. We envision a future where we offer the broadest possible selection of premium, personalized products. In 2018, we will launch two new product categories, Kids and Pets, while continuing to launch additional product types in the Home Décor and Personalized Gifts categories. We also expect to reduce the cost and time to launch a new product to further accelerate the pace of product introduction in 2018 and beyond. 

• | Pivot towards mobile

Mobile is a core element of our growth strategy itself and the above mentioned two areas of strategic focus also support our ambitious plans for mobile in 2018. We will continue to add more products to the app and iterate on our simplified and intuitive creation paths. We will make significant enhancements to our shopping experience and navigation to support discovery even as our product catalog expands, and give greater prominence to personalized campaigns and automatically created products in the app. Our mobile platform has a strong focus on monetization, optimizing conversion to first purchase and driving customer lifetime value through expanded use of impulse buy and cross-sell campaigns. We expect to continue to acquire new customers to mobile whom we would not have acquired on the web, and over time, we expect to create mobile-first and mobile-only experiences as well.

• | Leverage our manufacturing platform

With SBS, we have already demonstrated that we can leverage our existing capabilities to build an entirely new business to a new set of customers, providing variable and just-in-time printing needs and driving volume through our fixed-cost infrastructure. SBS historically has built dedicated systems to support each large customer and we are now building a scalable platform that enables any of our clients to optimize their integrated marketing campaigns. We intend to leverage this work to obtain additional SBS customers. Over time, we expect to leverage our manufacturing platform to serve a broader set of Enterprise customers and business use-cases above and beyond SBS. In 2017, we took advantage of an opportunity to complete the upgrade of the majority of our color printer fleet that enabled us to improve quality, increase throughput and automation, and lower consumable costs. In 2018, we expect to continue to deliver further improvements on quality, cost, automation, lower reliance on seasonal labor and speed of delivery. 
Technology and Production Systems
We intend to continue our efforts to make improvements in our platform and infrastructure including our big data strategy and analytics, e-commerce development, and manufacturing scale and automation. The scale and scope economies from our vertically integrated manufacturing and supply chain enable us to extend our competitive position and improve overall customer satisfaction, further strengthening our competitive position. 
We use a combination of proprietary and third-party technology, including the following:
Customer relationship management or CRM system. Our integrated CRM system is composed of various tools designed to convert first-time customers into repeat buyers. We seek to increase average order sizes by expanding customer awareness, providing 
8

targeted, segmented offers to customers, and encouraging cross- and up-selling. The system uses a variety of data, including website usage patterns, order size, order frequency, products purchased, seasonality factors, image upload, and share usage, as well as customer satisfaction information. This data is continually updated and refreshed in a data warehouse, from which different customer segments are identified and monitored on a continuing basis for targeted marketing communications.
By using this deep customer intelligence and ongoing analysis, we can offer customers a more personalized website experience and target them with specific website promotions, discounts, specialized e-mail, and direct mail offers. Our promotion engine generates special offers that are applied automatically at checkout.
We are also able to dynamically assign visitors to test and control groups who are shown different versions of our service. This form of A-B testing enables us to continuously optimize products, promotions, and user interaction with our websites.
Website system. We have designed our website systems to be secure and highly available within a managed data center as well as within leading public clouds. We can scale to increasing numbers of customers cost-effectively by adding relatively inexpensive industry-standard computers and servers and by scaling our use of public clouds. We have a strong commitment to our privacy policy, and we utilize technologies such as firewalls, encryption technology for secure transmission of personal information between customers’ computers and our website system, and intrusion detection systems.
Image archive. We store our customers’ images in our image archive as well as public clouds. Once a customer uploads a photo to our website, it is copied to highly redundant storage systems. We continue to expand our storage capacity to meet increasing customer demand. Our innovative storage architecture provides low storage costs, facilitates the safe, secure archiving of customers’ images and delivers the speed and performance required to enable customers to access, enhance and edit their images in real-time.
Render farm. Once a customer orders a photo or any photo-based product, our render farm technology performs fully automated image processing on the image prior to production. Once a customer orders a photo or any photo-based product, our render farm technology performs fully automated image processing on the image prior to production. Except for 4x6 and 5x7 prints, the customer’s original uploaded image is retrieved from the image archive for production purposes. The render farm applies automatic algorithms to enhance the color, contrast and sharpness to every image before it is sent to production, unless the customer had explicitly chosen not to do so. The render farm also performs customer-requested edits such as crop, borders, customized back-printing and red-eye removal.
To ensure that output is of consistent quality, we apply our proprietary ColorSure technology during this render stage. ColorSure creates an automated mapping of the image’s specific attributes to the printer’s specific print calibrations and attributes, prior to production. For example, this technology allows a 4x6 print to look the same as a photo printed on an enlargement or in a photo book, even if they are ordered at separate times.
Production system. We operate our own production facilities in Fort Mill, South Carolina; Tempe, Arizona; and Shakopee, Minnesota. Our automated production system controls our production processes, including order management and pick, pack and ship operations. Using proprietary algorithms, the production system analyzes tens of thousands of orders daily and automates the workflow into our state-of-the-art digital presses.
Shutterfly Photos. We also made progress toward our vision of creating a world-class memory management service connected to the smartest personalized e-commerce solutions with our Shutterfly Photos. By modernizing our technology platform and developing new customer-friendly features, we have addressed the friction points caused by multiple devices, fragmented storage options, and limited organization and search capabilities for interacting with photos and videos. 
Our technology and development expense was $168.4 million, $166.9 million, and $155.3 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Competition
The industry for personalized and digital photography products and services is large, evolving, and intensely competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. We face intense competition from a wide range of companies, including the following:

● | Online digital photography services companies such as Snapfish, Vistaprint, and many others;

9


● | Social media companies that host and enable mobile access to and posting of images such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, Snapchat and Google+;


● | Photo hosting websites that allow users to upload and share images at no cost such as Apple iCloud, Google Photos, and Flickr;


● | “Big Box” retailers such as Wal-Mart, Costco, Sam’s Club, Target, and others that offer low cost digital photography products and services. In addition to providing low-cost competitive product offerings on their respective websites, these competitors provide in-store fulfillment and self-service kiosks for printing, and may, among other strategies, offer their customers heavily discounted in-store products and services that compete directly with our offerings;


● | Drug stores such as Walgreens, CVS/pharmacy, and others that offer low-cost photography products and services as well as in-store pick-up from their photo website Internet orders;


● | Traditional offline stationery companies such as PaperSource, Crane & Co., and Papyrus;


● | Cloud-based storage services and file-syncing services such as Dropbox, Box, Everalbum, Amazon Photos and iCloud;


● | Specialized companies in the photo book and stationery business such as Hallmark, Cardstore by American Greetings, Minted, Invitations by Dawn, Picaboo, Blurb, Mixbook, Postable, Artifact Uprising and Chatbooks;


● | Photo-related software companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Adobe;


● | Online and offline companies specializing in photo-based merchandise and personalized home décor such as Zazzle, CafePress, Art.Com, Canvas On Demand, Personalization Mall, Personal Creations, Things Remembered, Mark & Graham, CustomInk, Teespring and Etsy.


● | Providers of digital alternatives to our products, such as Paperless Post, Evite, Animoto, and PicCollage.


● | Home printing service providers such as Hewlett-Packard and Epson that are seeking to expand their printer and ink businesses by gaining market share in the digital photography marketplace;


● | Enterprise digital and print communications companies such as RR Donnelley and Sons Company, O'Neil Data Systems, Inc., Quad/Graphics, Inc. and Viatech Publishing Solutions, Inc.;


● | Regional photography companies such as Ritz Camera that have established brands and customer bases in existing photography markets; and


● | Camera and photographic supply companies that rent equipment nationwide both online and in brick-and-mortar stores such as LensRentals.com, Cameralends, AbelCine, and Adorama.

We believe the primary competitive factors in attracting and retaining customers are brand recognition and trust, quality of products and services, breadth of products and services, user affinity and loyalty, customer service, ease of use, convenience, and price.
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to many of these factors, particularly customer trust and loyalty, quality and breadth of products and services, and customer service. Many of our competitors promote their products based on low prices or the convenience of same-day availability for digital photos printed in drugstores or other retail outlets. Generally, we distinguish ourselves from such competitors principally based on product quality and innovation, rather than price or same-day delivery.
Intellectual Property
Protecting our intellectual property rights is part of our strategy for continued growth and competitive differentiation. We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark law. We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and business partners, and control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.
10

As of December 31, 2017, we had 113 issued patents, which expire at various dates between 2019 and 2036, and more than 20 patent applications pending in the United States. Our issued patents and patent applications relate primarily to intelligent product creation; image uploading, sharing, and editing; ordering and sharing products; cloud image storage infrastructure; machine learning; manufacturing optimization; mobile and social media technologies; and automated and personalized manufacturing. We intend to pursue corresponding patent coverage in additional countries to the extent we believe such coverage is appropriate and cost efficient. However, we cannot be certain that any of our pending or any future applications will be granted. In addition, third parties could bring invalidity, co-inventorship or similar claims with respect to any of our currently issued patents or any patents that may be issued to us in the future.
Our primary brands are “Shutterfly” and “Tiny Prints”. We hold applications and/or registrations for the Shutterfly and Tiny Prints trademarks in our major territories of the United States and Canada, as well as in the European Community. We also hold applications and registrations for the Shutterfly mark in Mexico, Japan and China, and for the Shutterfly and Tiny Prints marks in Australia and New Zealand. We own the domains Shutterfly.com, TinyPrints.com, BorrowLenses.com and Groovebook.com among others.
Government Regulation 
The legal environment of the Internet is constantly evolving in the United States and elsewhere. The manner in which existing laws and regulations will be applied to the Internet in general, and how they will relate to our business in particular, is unclear in many cases. Accordingly, we often cannot be certain how existing laws will apply in the online context, including with respect to such topics as privacy, defamation, pricing, credit card fraud, advertising, taxation, sweepstakes, promotions, content regulation, net neutrality, quality of products, and services and intellectual property ownership and infringement. Legal issues relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users are currently unsettled both within the United States and abroad.
Numerous laws have been adopted at the national and state level in the United States that could have an impact on our business. These laws include the following:

● | The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and similar laws adopted by a number of states. These laws are intended to regulate unsolicited commercial emails, create criminal penalties for unmarked sexually-oriented material and e-mails containing fraudulent headers and control other abusive online marketing practices.


● | The Communications Decency Act, which gives statutory protection to online service providers who distribute third-party content.


● | The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which is intended to reduce the liability of online service providers for listing or linking to third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights of others.


● | The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003, which are intended to restrict the distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect user information from minors. In addition, the Protection of Children From Sexual Predators Act of 1998 requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances.


● | Statutes adopted in the State of California and other states, require online services to report certain breaches of the security of personal data, and to report to consumers when their personal data might be disclosed to direct marketers.


● | The federal Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the "CARD Act") includes provisions governing the use of gift cards, including specific disclosure requirements and a prohibition or limitation on the use of expiration dates and fees. Each state regulates gift cards in its own manner, so long as in concert with the CARD Act. Several states are attempting to pass new laws regulating the use of gift cards and amending state escheatment laws to try to pass new laws regulating the use of gift cards and amending state escheatment laws to try and obtain unused gift card balances.


● | The Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act ("ROSCA") prohibits and prevents Internet-based post-transaction third party sales and imposes specific requirements on negative option features.

11


● | The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "Patient Act"), as well as other healthcare reform legislation being considered by Congress and state legislatures. Changes to our healthcare costs structure could increase our employee healthcare-related costs.

To resolve some of the remaining legal uncertainty, we expect new U.S. and foreign laws and regulations to be adopted over time that will be directly or indirectly applicable to the Internet and to our activities. In addition, government agencies may begin regulating previously unregulated Internet activities or applying existing laws in new ways to providers of online services. Moreover, the law relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and business partners is currently unsettled both within the United States and abroad. Any existing or new legislation applicable to us could expose us to government investigations or audits, prosecution for violations of applicable laws and/or substantial liability, including penalties, damages, significant attorneys’ fees and expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations or the need to modify our business practices. From time to time, claims may be threatened against us for aiding and abetting, defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of information to which we provide links or that we or others post online. On a more general level, government regulation of the Internet could dampen the growth in the use of the Internet, have the effect of discouraging innovation and investment in Internet-based enterprises or lead to unpredictable litigation.
We post on our websites our privacy policies and practices concerning the use and disclosure of user data. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, Federal Trade Commission requirements or other privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings that could potentially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In this regard, there are many federal and state legislative proposals before the United States Congress and various state legislative bodies regarding privacy issues related to our business. It is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be adopted and certain proposals, such as required use of disclaimers, if adopted, could harm our business through a decrease in user registrations and revenues.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 1,934 full time employees. Below is a summary of employees by function as of December 31, for each of the last three years:

 | 2017 | 2016 | | 2015
Cost of revenue | 987 | | 1,018 | | 999 
Technology and development | 533 | | 585 | | 560 
Sales and marketing | 236 | | 290 | | 272 
General and administrative | 178 | | 191 | | 185 
Total | 1,934 | | 2,084 | | 2,016

During the peak holiday season, we hire contract workers on a temporary basis from third-party outsourcing firms. For example, during our peak production period in the fourth quarter of 2017, we used approximately 4,000 temporary workers to assist in our production and fulfillment operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
