Executive Summary of Our Business 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel cancer therapeutics that are intended to be effective across many tumor types while also being relatively non-toxic compared to conventional therapies. Tyme has reported clinical data on over 100 cancer patients who have used our lead clinical program, SM-88, which is a novel combination therapy based on dysfunctional metyrosine derivatives. As of June 2018, SM-88 has shown complete or partial imaging responses in 15 different cancer subtypes, including solid tumors, sarcomas, gliomas and hematological malignancies, without demonstrating drug-related severe adverse events (AEs). Tyme has two ongoing Phase II clinical trials in metastatic pancreatic cancer and biomarker-recurrent prostate cancer, and has previously completed a 30-patient Phase I trial (the First Human Study or FHS), which has shown what we believe to be promising data, and maintains an ongoing expanded access program outside of the FHS that has treated 77 patients to date as a part of a compassionate use program under Institutional Review Board (IRB) supervision or FDA Individual Investigational New Drug (INDs) application. 
 Tyme has and intends to continue to work towards its overall corporate mission of developing effective cancer therapies that can extend patients lives while not compromising on the quality of life gained.

SM-88: Completed Studies 
 In October 2017, we announced that we had completed a long-term follow-up analysis of patients from the First Human Study, who were originally enrolled during 2012. The FHS involved 30 patients with actively progressing metastatic cancer who had failed or refused available treatment options across solid tumor types. The FHS was initially designed as a six-to-twelve-week study to determine safety of SM-88 in the end-stage treatment setting. When multiple patients showed what we define as Clinical Benefit under Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST) criteria, treatment was continued for some patients over multiple years. RECIST 1.1 is a standardized criterion established by the National Institute of Health (NIH) for the assessment of changes in tumor burden in patients. The criterion has fixed thresholds for changes in size, number of monitored lesions, lymph node involvement of the cancer, and other factors. The primary assessment for change in tumor size is determined by computerized axial tomography (CAT) or CT imaging. Other imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) scans can be used to determine the development of new lesions, or resolution of lesions, but are not currently acceptable under this criterion for the quantification for the change in tumor volume. This study was conducted under IRB supervision without U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of an investigational new drug application (IND). Initial data from the FHS was published at conferences, including the American Society of Clinical Oncologists (ASCO), and then used to receive FDA IND approval for SM-88 to enter a Phase Ib/II prostate cancer trial in 2015. We believe our FHS indicated that SM-88 was well-tolerated and showed preliminary activity across a number of different cancer types in terms of tumor regression, biomarker improvement, and overall survival. 
 In the FHS, patients achieved median overall survival (OS) to 29.8 months from the start of treatment with SM-88 and a 33% monotherapy objective response rate (ORR), consisting of four complete responses (CR) and six partial responses (PR), based on RECIST, which sets forth certain criteria for assessing treatment outcomes. Five FHS patients survived for over five years after commencing SM-88 treatment. All FHS patients improved or maintained Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS), a five-point scale to measure quality of life after initiating SM-88 therapy and overall survival was comparable for patients who entered the trial with ECOG PS ranging from 0 (asymptomatic) to 2 (unable to perform any work-related activities). 
 We have also reported multiple subgroup analyses of FHS patients. As of September 2017, 67% of FHS patients were reported to have had no additional systemic therapies other than SM-88 since their initial enrollment in FHS in 2012, including all five of the surviving FHS patients. Patients without any further treatment beyond SM-88 showed greater median OS (38 months) than patients who received subsequent treatments beyond SM-88 (28 months). In addition, patients with two or more prior systemic therapies (n=11) experienced a median OS of 23 months, including two CRs and three PRs, after beginning SM-88 therapy. For the three most common cancer types in the FHS, we reported median OS as follows: breast cancer, 35 months (n=14); lung cancer, 25 months (n=5); and pancreatic cancer, 24 months (n=3). In the breast cancer subgroup, median OS of 35 months was achieved despite patients having an average of 2.5 prior lines of systemic drug therapy and 4.5 prior therapeutic lines, including systemic, surgical or radiation therapy. 43% of patients in the breast cancer subgroup achieved CR or PR while on SM-88 monotherapy and ECOG PS average baseline improved from 1.8 to 0.6 after six weeks of SM-88 therapy. Additionally, after having stopped SM-88 treatment in the FHS, three breast cancer patients received additional treatment with SM-88 at a later time and all three of such patients were alive as of the last reported data in October 2017. One of the re-treated patients experienced a second objective tumor response from SM-88 monotherapy as measured by RECIST criteria. 
 Given the duration of survival combined with lack of documented disease progressions in many SM-88 patients, we believe that traditional RECIST response criteria, a commonly used clinical endpoint based primarily on static radiographic scans that measure tumor diameter, may not fully reflect the therapeutic benefit from SM-88 and that measuring metabolic function through 
PET standardized uptake values (SUV) imaging may more accurately correlate the effect of SM-88. For the ASCO general meeting in June 2018 (ASCO 2018), we published data comparing the impact of SM-88 therapy using RECIST or PET analysis. Eleven patients had comparative evaluable data between the two imaging modalities, of whom 10 eventually experienced a CR or PR under RECIST criteria. All subjects experienced a greater decrease using PET (median -48% SUV) than RECIST (median -1% tumor diameter). As treatment continued, the early SUV response had an 85.7% positive predictive value for CR or PR response in RECIST. A patient would be considered to have stable disease (SD) under RECIST if his or her tumor volume remained in a narrow, specified range, even if there was a substantial reduction to the PET scan values suggesting that the tumor was metabolically inactive. Because the overall survival data suggest that patients with SD according to RECIST 1.1 may also have clinical benefit, we include the commonly used calculation of Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), which includes patients achieving RECIST CR, PR and SD designations.

Additionally, as published in a retrospective analysis for ASCO 2018, from data available up to September 2017, 77 advanced cancer patients had been treated outside of the FHS with SM-88 (the Compassionate Use Patients) as part of a compassionate use program under IRB supervision. When performing this updated review, we required patient data providing information that could be evaluated to measure response criteria that are recognized by regulatory bodies, such as RECIST criteria. These criteria require imaging such as CT or MRI. Some patients in this group may have only had metabolic or PET imaging, or a mixture of PET/CT that does not support RECIST response criteria. 53 of the 77 Compassionate Use Patients had such evaluable data, as determined by both baseline and follow-up CT (CAT) scans following at least six-weeks of therapy. Compassionate Use Patients also began with actively progressive disease and generally followed the same or similar SM-88 treatment plan as the FHS patients, however 43% (23/53) received SM-88 therapy in combination with other cancer treatments, while 57% or 30/53 received SM-88 as a monotherapy. 45% (24/53) of patients experienced a CR or PR and an additional 30% (16/53) achieved SD (75% Clinical Benefit). 
 The following table combines the 30 patients from the FHS and 53 evaluable Compassionate Use Patients into several subgroups based on data available through September 2017. Note that the percentage of patients included is based on the number evaluable: 
 

Category | # of Patients(1) | ORR (CR/PR) | Median OS (months)
Combination Therapy | 23/81 (28%) | 39% (4%/35%) | 8.5 
Monotherapy | 58/81 (72%) | 43% (19%/24%) | 22.8 
Duration SM-88: 2-6 months | 60/83 (72%) | 28% (5%/23%) | 9.6 
Duration SM-88: >6 months | 23/83 (28%) | 74% (39%/35%) | 25.3 
Visceral & bone metastases | 17/39* (44%) | 41% (18%/24%) | 11.7 
ECOG PS ³2 | 30/66 (45%) | 47% (20%/27%) | 9.6 
ECOG PS 0 or 1 | 36/66 (55%) | 39% (17%/22) | 24.5 


* | 39 of the 81 patients had complete records on both visceral and bone metastases. Patients in which baseline status of either of these items were unknown were excluded from this calculation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(1) | Due to the nature of compassionate use programs, for which the data gathered is not specifically governed by a formal study protocol, not all data was available for all patients. If such data was not available, such patient was excluded from the related calculation.

The safety summary of the drug-related adverse events in the First Human Study (FHS) is summarized in the table below. Due to the nature of compassionate use programs as opposed to a study subject to a more defined protocol, detailed safety findings were not compiled. There were however, no drug-related adverse events reported in any of the full 77 patients.

 Through these two programs, patients being treated with SM-88 have achieved CRs or PRs across 15 different cancer types, including some of the most common and difficult to treat cancers, such as pancreatic, prostate, breast, lung, glioma, ovarian, sarcoma and colon cancer. As of the release of the interim results in September 2017, SM-88 had not been associated with any drug-related moderate or severe AEs. Based on preliminary data from the FHS and the Compassionate Use Patients suggesting SM-88 may have broad potential applicability and acceptable toxicity, we believe that SM-88 may ultimately have potential as a treatment for a wide range of cancers prior to the end-stage setting. 
 SM-88: Currently Enrolling Phase II Trial for Pancreatic Cancer 
 Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest major cancers, with a one-year survival rate of 20% at diagnosis according to the American Cancer Society. The poor prognosis is partially due to more than 80% of cases being metastatic at the time of diagnosis. When patients with pancreatic cancer are resistant to first line therapy  as were all 12 pancreatic patients who were treated in our FHS and compassionate use program, survival is often only a few months and clinical response rates are very low. Based on our initial results described below and the dire state of the disease, we have initiated a Phase II trial in refractory pancreatic cancer patients during the first half of 2018. On September 29, 2017, we submitted an SM-88 IND to the FDA for pancreatic cancer patients. On March 14, 2018 we announced that the FDA has accepted our IND application allowing us to initiate our currently enrolling Phase II clinical trial for SM-88 in pancreatic cancer. As of the date of this report, we have opened eleven sites across the U.S. and have patients enrolled in the study. We anticipate making the first presentation of interim data by early 2019. 
 SM-88: Retrospective Review of Pancreatic Patients 
 At the January 2018 ASCO Gastrointestinal annual meeting, we presented a retrospective review of the pancreatic cancer subjects treated through our FHS or as Compassionate Use Patients. Overall, of the 107 subjects treated in these programs, 12 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer have received SM-88 therapy. Two of these 12 patients received less than one cycle (six weeks) of SM-88 and were excluded from this analysis. Of the remaining ten patients, three were from the FHS and seven were Compassionate Use Patients. We believe all subjects were considered incurable, with 70% (7/10) of these patients having progressive disease and 30% (3/10) having recurrent disease. These patients had also failed or refused other available therapies. The median baseline ECOG PS of patients was two at baseline and had improved by 20% to one within six weeks of SM-88 therapy initiation. In contrast to current standard of care therapies for pancreatic cancer, which produce serious adverse events in more than half of patients, ultimately, 80% (8/10) of SM-88 treated patients showed improvements in ECOG PS and 30% (3/10) had a greater than one-point improvement. Median pain (as per NRS-11) reported by these patients improved from 3 at baseline to 0 at the end of the first SM-88 cycle. The range of pain scores also decreased from 0  7.5 points at baseline to 0  2.5 points at six weeks. While on therapy, 60% (6/10) of patients gained weight and 40% (4/10) maintained their weight. Additionally, all patients maintained or improved European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) subject reported outcomes for health (QLQ-C30 #29) and quality of life (QLQ-C30 #30) after initiating SM-88 therapy. Despite treating patients with a range of 0 to 6 lines of prior therapy, patients experienced a median progression free survival of 4.6 months. 40% (4/10) of these patients experienced an overall survival greater than 12 months and 30% (3/10) achieved a complete or partial response under RECIST criteria. One patient whose cancer was progressing while receiving traditional chemotherapy treatment experienced a partial response when SM-88 was added. We are currently enrolling patients in a Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of pancreatic cancer that we initiated in the first half of calendar year 2018.

SM-88: Currently Enrolling Phase II Prostate Cancer Trial 
 We are currently enrolling an open-label single arm Phase Ib/II trial in localized non-metastatic prostate cancer for biomarker-recurrent maintenance therapy. This six-month multi-center, open label study is expected to enroll approximately 34 subjects with biomarker-recurrent prostate cancer who have rising Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) levels and no radiographically detectable lesions. Subjects receive daily oral doses of SM-88. Efficacy endpoints include radiographic progression free survival, reductions in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or the need for subsequent chemotherapy or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and PSA doubling time. We completed our Phase Ib trial in January 2017, and initiated Phase II enrollment shortly thereafter. 
 As presented at the ASCO Genitourinary meeting in February 2018, 13 subjects in our Phase Ib/II trial have received study medication with evaluable results and 12 have completed at least one 28-day cycle (median 6, range 1-16) of therapy. While on therapy, eight subjects had a greater than 50% reduction in CTCs, five subjects had less than 5 cells per 7.5ml of blood and five subjects had at least one measure reported as undetectable. The median time to achieving an undetectable level of CTCs was 20 weeks (with a range of three to 28 weeks). PSA levels similarly demonstrated positive trends, with 92% (12/13) of subjects having at least one cycle in which PSA velocity improved (i.e. at least one decrease in PSA). The median time since biologic recurrence of the trial subjects, as of December 2017, was 12 months. Radiographic recurrence was observed in only 8% (1/13) of trial subjects. All reported drug-related and possibly drug-related adverse events have been mild in nature (grade one), and none of the subjects required ADT or chemotherapies during treatment.

Other Clinical and Development Plans 
 We intend to focus on expanding our clinical activities to certain late-stage cancer patient populations who have generally failed or refused all possible therapies with curative intent. We believe this strategy combines our objectives to address substantial unmet need with a more clear and rapid regulatory pathway. We believe lung, breast, bone and brain cancers may be appropriate additional indications given the demonstrated effect of SM-88 on these cancer types in our FHS and Compassionate Use Patients.

We intend to initiate additional Phase II studies in these or other cancers as resources become available. We may also develop other products for oncology using alternate delivery platforms as well as alternate product compositions. SM-88 is generally intended as an oral therapy that is broadly applicable to cancers; however, alternate routes of delivery may be more appropriate for use by certain patients or as treatment for certain types of cancer. For example, we have developed a prototype injectable formulation that may be beneficial for patients with a compromised digestive system and as a result are not able to absorb the oral formulation. Confronted with this situation, applicable end-stage First Human Study patients were administered with small SM-88 subcutaneous doses (of the tyrosine derivative component) in combination with an oral SM-88 dose to ensure absorption and we believe treating physicians for SM-88 Compassionate Use Patients also treated these end-stage patients with SM-88 by subcutaneous and/or oral delivery. We also have other alternative formulations, at various stages of development, such as transdermal and nasal, that we believe could provide an effective alternative therapeutic effect for patients with certain forms of cancer, including breast cancer and glioblastoma. 
 SM-88 Mechanism of Action 
 SM-88 is an oral, combination therapy with our proprietary dysfunctional tyrosine derivative as the backbone. Tyrosine is a non-essential amino acid that has a high affinity for uptake by cancer cells, but has minimal uptake by healthy cells. The tyrosine derivative used in SM-88 is designed to interfere with processes of cancer cells requiring functional tyrosine, such as protein synthesis. The other active components of SM-88 are rapamycin, methoxsalen, and phenytoin, which are used to complement and augment the activity of the tyrosine derivative and ultimately cause apoptosis of the cancer cells, in part, as a result of oxidative stress. Each of these three non-tyrosine components have been FDA approved for other conditions and are each administered at doses that are approximately 25% or less than their recommended therapeutic dosing levels for their respective approved indications. These four components are being individually orally administered to patients according to a dosage regimen in our ongoing Phase II trials. We believe the effectiveness of our tyrosine derivative in effecting cancer cell death is enhanced by combining it with small doses of the aforementioned three repurposed agents, which we believe may increase the uptake of the tyrosine derivative and enhance oxidative stress on the tumor cells. 
 SM-88 is intended to disrupt the cancer cells unique microenvironment following uptake of our tyrosine derivative. We believe that when the cancer cell attempts to use the dysfunctional tyrosine derivative for protein synthesis to create mucin, the process fails and the mucin layer begins to deteriorate. Mucin acts as a protective layer around the cancer cell that defends the tumor from the elements in the body outside the cancer cell. Without a stable protective coating from mucin, tumor cells become exposed to the host immune system. Mucin is also involved in the upregulation of enzymes that neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS). The erosion of the mucin can therefore also result in a heightened state of oxidative stress in cancer cells. Excessive oxidative stress is recognized to trigger a natural cell death process called apoptosis, that leads programmed destruction of the cell. 
Development Strategy and Key Product Properties 
 Our goal is to develop cancer therapies that are both effective cancer treatments and less toxic than current treatment options. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are: 

 | Successfully advance SM-88 through clinical development, including registration trials and commercial launch. We intend to pursue a worldwide development and commercialization plan for SM-88.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continue to invest in our technology platform and IP portfolio to further build our pipeline. We plan to expand our R&D efforts to encompass multiple indications and products within the oncology field. We have undertaken additional early development programs for improved formulations of SM-88 as well as wholly new compounds.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
9 
 

 | Build a balanced portfolio of proprietary and partnered programs. We plan to independently develop and commercialize multiple drug candidates for human indications within the oncology field. For targets outside our core areas of interest or where a partner can contribute specific expertise, we intend to evaluate potential collaborations with strategic partners and/or potential acquisitions of other companies that can augment our expertise and technology, as well as a means to acquire rights or ownership of additional IP. We also contemplate exploring global development partners and arrangements, where appropriate.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 By using SM-88 to disrupt key aspects of cancers unique metabolism, our intention is to create a therapy that is: 
 

 | Broadly effective across different cancer types  Because a vast majority of cancers use the same metabolic process, we believe that they likely also have the same susceptibilities to the components of SM-88, regardless of origin;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Highly specific to cancer  As supported by the current safety data reported for over 100 patients, together with recent advances in radiographic imaging that use tyrosine-based agents to selectively image cancer cells, cancer appears to have a high affinity for tyrosine uptake compared to normal cells. We believe the primary effects of SM-88 are derived from the modified tyrosine component;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Well-tolerated/ Broad Therapeutic Margin Safety findings are available for over 100 patients, including relatively asymptomatic patients from our Phase II prostate cancer trials, and there have been no reported drug-related serious adverse events. Further studies in relatively healthy individuals have not shown significant side effects;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Suitable for monotherapy or combination therapy  Although most of Tymes clinical and compassionate use experience has been in monotherapy, SM-88s differentiated mechanism of action (MOA) and safety profile may also allow it to be effective in combination with other cancer therapeutics with lower potential for overlapping toxicities; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A Potentially effective treatment for patients who have failed other therapeutic options  Cancers typically develop resistance mechanisms that can make them less responsive to subsequent chemotoxic treatments and patients can accumulate toxicities that can make them ineligible for subsequent treatments. However, as the fundamental metabolism of the cancer related to SM-88 and amino acid/tyrosine uptake does not appear to commonly change with traditional cancer treatments, and SM-88s relatively low toxicity profile, we believe SM-88 can be an effective alternative to existing subsequent standard of care treatments.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe we can become a leader in developing cancer therapies with our platform technology for the following reasons: 
 

 | SM-88 has demonstrated its potential as an effective and selective combination drug product treatment, with encouraging antitumor activity in 15 different types of cancer to date.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | To date, SM-88 has not shown significant toxic side effects at current therapeutic dose levels and we believe the novel mechanism of action should allow a range of potential combinations with existing treatment modalities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Tyme has created multiple delivery forms of SM-88 for the purpose of optimizing therapies for certain cancers/patients, including subcutaneous, intranasal, and transdermal formulations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We currently retain all commercial rights for SM-88 in connection with the treatment of cancer and have undertaken an extensive multinational patent effort to protect those rights.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We have a technology base and patent portfolio supporting SM-88 and have filed patents for additional drug candidates to provide a pipeline of oncology drug development programs based on our technology platform.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition 
 Our business strategy is intended to effectively position SM-88 for competition with products manufactured by other companies in the highly fragmented and competitive cancer treatment market. Our competition comes from other commercial and research enterprises working in the field of cancer research. This includes pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and government research institutes around the globe. 
 
10 
 
Important competitive factors include patient safety, effectiveness, quality-of-life and ease of use of products; price and demonstrated cost-effectiveness; marketing effectiveness; and research and development of new products and processes. Most new products we intend to market, assuming regulatory approval, will and must compete with other products already on the market as well as products that are later developed by existing or new competitors. If competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products would be subject to progressive price reductions, decreased volume of sales or both. Increasingly, to obtain favorable reimbursement and formulary positioning with government payers, managed care organizations and pharmacy benefits managers, we would be required to demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also more value as compared with other treatment regimens. 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development and regulatory plans in addition to proprietary scientific knowledge provide us with certain competitive advantages, we currently have limited financial resources and no revenue source and face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, each of whom has significantly greater financial resources than us. Any drugs that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new potential therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Our products, if approved for sale, would eventually be subject to competition from generic drug manufacturers. Manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals generally invest far less in Research and Development (R&D) and marketing than R&D companies such as us. We anticipate that any manufacturer of a generic version of our drugs will invest far less than we have in the past and intend to do in the future. They therefore, have the advantage in that they can price their drugs much lower than the brand-name drugs for which we obtain approval. Additionally, in many countries outside the United States, Intellectual Property (IP) protection is weak or nonexistent and we would be forced to compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products in such countries whether or not we hold legal exclusivity. 
 The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy. Our products once approved, would compete not only with other drugs, but also with such other types of therapies and treatments. 
 There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well-established therapies and widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payers. In general, although there has been considerable progress over the past few decades in the treatment of cancer with currently marketed therapies providing benefits to many patients, these therapies often are limited to some extent by a lack of efficacy and/or the significance or frequency of AEs. 
 In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of medicines in late-stage clinical development to treat cancer. These medicines in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant, additional competition for SM-88.
Intellectual Property 
 We will strive to protect and enhance our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including through seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights (when required), whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also intend to rely on trade secrets related to our proprietary technology platform and our know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of cancer treatment, which may be important for the development of our business. We additionally may rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions, where available. 
 
11 
 
Our commercial success may depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both our owned and licensed IP, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing such products, as well as being held valid if challenged. 
 Tyme has filed more than 60 patent applications in the US and abroad, with five U.S. patents issued thus far. The patents encompass SM-88 as well as citing inventions that fight cancer and aid in the creation of novel mechanisms to further that effort. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We have and will continue to seek U.S. and international patent protection for a variety of technologies, including: pharmaceutical compositions, methods for treating diseases of interest, methods for manufacturing the pharmaceutical compositions and research tools and methods. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel products. We will also seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. 
 We believe we have no need to license any technologies for SM-88 to be commercially viable. We believe our Company owns all the IP necessary for our SM-88 to perform as intended and to be commercially marketed, once all applicable regulatory requirements have been obtained. Additionally, we believe the drug substances utilized in SM-88 are not covered by any patents that would impede our use of such drug substances. 
 FDA Approval Process 
 SM-88 is subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FDA as a drug product. The FDA subjects drug products to extensive pre- and post-market regulation. The Public Health Service Act (PHSA), the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and the import and export of drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications (NDAs), withdrawal of approvals, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or fines or civil or criminal penalties. 
 The drug development process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the U.S. is long, expensive and inherently uncertain. Drug development in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal testing, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Developing the data to satisfy FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. 
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conducting of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices (GLP). The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 
12 
 
An IND must become effective before U.S. clinical trials may begin. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND submission within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or subjects with the condition under investigation, all under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practices (GCP), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the ongoing IND file. 
 The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to clinical trial subjects. The study protocol and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials must be submitted to an IRB for review and approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at a clinical site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRBs requirements or may impose other conditions to assure subject safety. The study sponsor may also suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a determination that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. In Phase I, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and is tested to assess pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, AEs associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. In the case of some products targeted for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer treatments, initial human testing may be conducted in the intended patient population. Phase II usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, as well as identification of common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase II, Phase III trials are initiated to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of subjects, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase III clinical trials are intended to establish data sufficient to demonstrate substantial evidence of the efficacy and safety of the product to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. Trials conducted outside of the U.S. under similar, GCP-compliant conditions in accordance with local applicable laws may also be acceptable to the FDA in support of product licensing. 
 Sponsors of clinical trials for investigational drugs must publicly disclose certain clinical trial information, including detailed trial design and trial results, in FDA public databases. These requirements are subject to specific timelines and apply to most controlled clinical trials of FDA-regulated products. 
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. The FDA review and approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the products pharmacology and CMC and must demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product based on these results. The NDA must also contain extensive manufacturing information. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial and is in addition to the costs of conducting clinical trials. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, as well as annual product and establishment user fees, which may total several million dollars and are typically increased annually. 
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agencys threshold determination that the NDA is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drugs are reviewed within 10 months from the date the application is accepted for filing. Although the FDA often meets its user fee performance goals, it can extend these timelines if necessary and its review may not occur on a timely basis at all. The FDA usually refers applications for novel drugs, which present complex questions of safety or efficacy, to an 
 
13 
 
 advisory committee - typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts - for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the drug product unless it verifies that compliance with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) standards is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication(s) being studied. 
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional nonclinical or clinical testing or supplemental information for the FDA to reconsider the application. If or when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAs satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two to six months depending on the type of information that was included. The FDA approval is never guaranteed and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. 
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. The approval for a drug may be significantly more limited than requested in the application, including limitations on the specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. The FDA may also require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, as a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to further ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS or use of a companion diagnostic with a drug can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require, as a condition of approval, substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drugs safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 As of March 31, 2018, we have two active INDs with the U.S. FDA, both associated with SM-88. The two INDs are associated with the relevant FDA departments that over see our two ongoing clinical trials, the Department of Oncology Products 1 (DOP1) for our prostate cancer trial, and the Department of Oncology Products 2 (DOP2) for our pancreatic cancer trial. 
 Priority Review/Standard Review (U.S.) and Related Requirements 
 The FDA may grant a NDA a priority review designation based both upon the request of an applicant and the results of the Phase III clinical trial(s) submitted in the NDA. This designation sets the target date at six months for FDA action on the application. Priority review is granted where preliminary trial results indicate that a product, if approved, has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy for a situation where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or where the product is possibly a significant improvement over existing marketed products. If these criteria are not met for priority review, the NDA is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months. However, priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for regulatory approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. 
 There can be no assurance that we would be able to satisfy any of these requirements to conduct preclinical or clinical trials or receive any regulatory approvals including priority or accelerated evaluation. 
 Breakthrough Therapy Approvals 
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act provides another designation for an expedited FDA review process called Breakthrough Therapy Designation. A breakthrough therapy is a drug that is intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing 
 
14 
 
 therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If a drug is designated as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA will expedite the development and review of such drug for trial and market approval. All requests for Breakthrough Therapy Designation will be reviewed within 60 days of receipt and FDA will either grant or deny the request. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Act 
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, newly approved drugs and indications may benefit from a statutory period of non-patent marketing exclusivity. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides five-year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety. The Hatch-Waxman Act prohibits having an effective approval date for an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for another version of such drug during the five-year exclusive period; however, submission of an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA containing a paragraph IV certification is permitted after four years, which may trigger a 30-month stay of approval of the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA. Protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act will not prevent the submission or approval of another full NDA; however, the applicant for the full NDA would be required to conduct its own preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for the approval of new and supplemental NDAs, including Section 505(b)(2) NDAs, for, among other things, new indications, dosages or strengths of a currently approved drug, if new clinical investigations conducted or sponsored by the applicant are determined by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the new or supplemental NDA. 
 In addition to non-patent marketing exclusivity, the Hatch-Waxman Act amended the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to require each NDA sponsor to submit with its application information on any patent that claims the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product (formulation and composition) and method-of-use for which the applicant submitted the NDA and with respect to which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner engaged in the manufacture, use or sale of the drug. Generic applicants that wish to rely on the approval of a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to each listed patent. The Orange Book is a listing of all drug products that have been approved by the FDA and their generic equivalences. We intend to submit for Orange Book listing all relevant patents for SM-88 and to vigorously defend any Orange Book-listed patents for our approved products. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Act also permits a patent term extension of up to five years as compensation for the patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, a patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years after the FDA approves a marketing application. The patent term extension period is generally equal to the sum of one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA and all the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, up to a total of five years. Only one patent applicable to a regulatory review period that represents the first commercial marketing of that drug is eligible for the extension and it 
 must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for patent term extension. We will consider applying for a patent term extension for some of our patents, to add patent life beyond the expiration date, depending on our ability to meet certain legal requirements permitting such extension and the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of an NDA. There can be no assurance that such an extension, if applied for, will be granted. 
 Advertising and Promotion 
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to continuing post-approval regulatory requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in significant penalties, including the issuance of warning letters directing a company to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials are pre-cleared by the FDA and federal and state civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. 
 
15 
 
Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes to indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing original and resubmitted NDAs. 
 AE Reporting and cGMP Compliance 
 AE reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase IV testing, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage and distribution procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain manufacturing subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals, request product recalls or impose marketing restrictions through labeling changes or product removals if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if the product encounters problems following initial marketing or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 
 Orphan Drug 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition; generally, a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not necessarily convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a product to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for the product for treatment of the specified indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee. When appropriate, we intend to hold discussions with the FDA regarding pursuing orphan drug designation for SM-88. There can be no assurance given that such discussions, if commenced, would result in our pursuing orphan drug designation for SM-88 or that, if pursued, the FDA would grant SM-88 an orphan drug designation. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 In the U.S., our activities are potentially subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (for example, the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice and state and local governments. 
European Regulation and Review 
 EU Approval Process 
 The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is a decentralized scientific agency of the European Union (EU). It coordinates the evaluation and monitoring of centrally authorized medicinal products. It is responsible for the scientific evaluation of applications for EU marketing authorizations, as well as the development of technical guidance and the provision of scientific advice to sponsors. The EMA decentralizes its scientific assessment of medicines by working through a network of about 4,500 experts throughout the EU, nominated by the Member States. The EMA draws on resources of over 40 National Competent Authorities of European Member States. 
 
16 
 
The process regarding regulatory approval of medicinal products in the EU follows roughly the same lines as in the U.S. and likewise generally involves satisfactorily completing each of the following: 
 

 | preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the applicable European GLP regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the relevant national authorities of a clinical trial application (CTA) for each trial in humans, which must be approved before the trial may begin;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the relevant competent authorities of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA), which includes the data supporting safety and efficacy as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product in clinical development and proposed labeling;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an inspection by the relevant national authorities of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product is produced to assess compliance with strictly enforced cGMPs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | potential audits of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the MAA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | review and approval by the relevant competent authority of the MAA before any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies 
 The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with the relevant European regulations and requirements. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animal studies in order to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. The results of the preclinical tests, together with relevant manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of the CTA. 
Clinical Trial Approval 
 Pursuant to the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, as amended, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the Member States. Under this system, approval must be obtained from the competent national authority of each European Member State in which a study is planned to be conducted. To this end, a CTA is submitted, which must be supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier (IMPD) and further supporting information prescribed by the Clinical Trials Directive and other applicable guidance documents. Furthermore, a clinical trial may only be started after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the clinical trial application in that country. 
 A new EU regulation on clinical trials was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers in 2014. The new regulation aims to simplify consent rules, streamline application procedures by creating a centralized process for approval, provide more transparency and harmonize performance of clinical trials throughout the EU Member States. The new regulations are anticipated to take effect in 2019, with one-year transition period during which a new CTA can be authorized either according to the old Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC or the new 536/2014 Regulation, as requested by the sponsor. 
 Manufacturing and import into the EU of investigational medicinal products is subject to the holding of appropriate authorizations and must be carried out in accordance with cGMPs. 
 Health Authority Interactions 
 During the development of a medicinal product, frequent interactions with the EU regulators are vital to make sure all relevant input and guidelines/regulations are taken into account in the overall program. 
 
17 
 
Pediatric Studies 
 Regulation (EC) 1901/2006, which came into force in the EU on January 26, 2007, aims to facilitate the development and accessibility of medical products for use in children without subjecting children to unnecessary trials or delaying the authorization of medicinal products for use in adults. The regulation established the Pediatric Committee (PDCO), which is responsible for coordinating the EMAs activities regarding medicines for children. The PDCOs main role is to determine which studies that marketing authorization applicants need to complete in the pediatric population as part of the so-called Pediatric Investigation Plans (PIP). All applications for marketing authorization for new medicines that were not authorized in the EU before January 26, 2007 have to include either the results of studies carried out in children of different ages (as agreed with the PDCO) or proof that a waiver or a deferral of these studies has been obtained from the PDCO. As indicated, the PDCO determines what pediatric studies are necessary and describes them in a PIP. This requirement for pediatric studies also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The PDCO can grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine in children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults and can also grant waivers when development of a medicine in children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population. 
 Before an MAA can be filed or an existing marketing authorization can be varied, the EMA checks that companies are in compliance with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP. 
 Regulation (EC) 1901/2006 also introduced several incentives for the development of medicines for children in the EU: 
 

 | medicines that have been authorized across the EU in compliance with an agreed PIP are eligible for an extension of their patent protection by six months (this is the case even when the pediatric studies results are negative);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | for orphan medicines, the incentive is an additional two years of market exclusivity, extending the typical 10-year period to 12 years;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | scientific advice and protocol assistance at the EMA are free of charge for questions relating to the development of medicines for children; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | medicines developed specifically for children that are already authorized but are not protected by a patent or supplementary protection certificate, may be eligible for a pediatric use marketing authorization (PUMA); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | if a PUMA is granted, the product will benefit from 10 years of market protection as an incentive for the development of the product for use in children.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAA 
 Authorization to market a product in the EU member states proceeds under one of three procedures: (i) a centralized authorization procedure, (ii) a mutual recognition procedure, (iii) a decentralized national procedure. 
Centralized Authorization Procedure 
 Certain drugs, including medicinal products developed by means of biotechnological processes, must be approved via the centralized authorization procedure for marketing authorization. A successful application under the centralized authorization procedure results in a marketing authorization from the European Commission, which is automatically valid in all EU member states. The other European Economic Area member states (namely Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) are also obligated to recognize the Commission decision. The EMA and the European Commission administer the centralized authorization procedure. 
 Under the centralized authorization procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) serves as the scientific committee that renders opinions about the safety, efficacy and quality of human products on behalf of the EMA. The CHMP is composed of experts nominated by each member states national drug authority, with one of them appointed to act as Rapporteur for the co-ordination of the evaluation with the possible 
 
18 
 
 assistance of a further member of the Committee acting as a Co-Rapporteur. After approval, the Rapporteur(s) continue to monitor the product throughout its life cycle. The CHMP is required to issue an opinion within 210 days of receipt of a valid application, though the clock is stopped if it is necessary to ask the applicant for clarification or further supporting data. The process is complex and involves extensive consultation with the regulatory authorities of member states and a number of experts. Once the procedure is completed, a European Public Assessment Report is produced. If the CHMP concludes that the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product are sufficiently proven, it adopts a positive opinion. The CHMPs opinion is sent to the European Commission, which uses the opinion as the basis for its decision whether or not to grant a marketing authorization. If the opinion is negative, information is given as to the grounds on which this conclusion was reached. After a drug has been authorized and launched, it is a condition of maintaining the marketing authorization that all aspects relating to its quality, safety and efficacy must be kept under review. Sanctions may be imposed for failure to adhere to the conditions of the marketing authorization. In extreme cases, the authorization may be revoked, resulting in withdrawal of the product from sale. 
 Mutual Recognition Procedure and Decentralized National Procedure 
 Under a Mutual Recognition Procedure (MRP) or a Decentralized Procedure (DCP), the applicant must select which and how many EU member states in which to seek approval. In the case of an MRP, the applicant must initially receive national approval in one EU member state. This will be the so-called reference member state (RMS) for the MRP. Then, the applicant seeks approval for the product in other EU member states, the so-called concerned member states (CMS) in a second step. 
 For the DCP, the applicant will approach all chosen Member States at the same time. To do so, the applicant will identify the RMS that will assess the submitted MAA and provide the other selected Member States with the conclusions and results of the assessment. In principle, the applicant can choose any EU Member State as the RMS; however, in almost all Member States, the applicant needs to send a request for a time slot when the applicant will be allowed to submit the application. Depending on the Member State selected as RMS, the interval between submission of the request to the actual submission date can be two years or longer. 
 Accelerated Assessment Procedure 
 Under the Centralized Procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days, which excludes clock stops when additional written or oral information needs to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by The CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, such as when a medicinal product is expected to be a major public health interest, as defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease to be treated (e.g. heavily disabling or life-threatening); the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and an anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. Under these circumstances, the European Medicines Agency ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is delivered within 150 days, excluding clock stops. There can be no assurance however, that we would be able to satisfy any of these requirements or receive any approval or accelerated evaluation. 
Conditional Approval 
 Under EU regulations, a medicine that would fulfill an unmet medical need may, if its immediate availability is in the interest of public health, be granted a conditional marketing authorization on the basis of less complete clinical data than are normally required, subject to specific obligations being imposed on the authorization holder. These specific obligations are to be reviewed annually by the EMA. The list of these obligations is to be made publicly accessible. Such an authorization is valid for one year, on a renewable basis. 
 Period of Authorization and Renewals 
 A marketing authorization is initially valid for five years and may then be renewed on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder is to provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variants introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least nine months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization shall be valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization that is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the European market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing Member State within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause). 
 
19 
 
Orphan Drug Designation 
 EU regulations also provide for an orphan drug designation. This designation is granted if its sponsor can establish: 
 

(a) | (i) that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made; or
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 (ii) that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment; and 
 

(b) | that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 An application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time before the filing of an application for approval to market the product. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. However, this period may be reduced to six years if at the end of the fifth year it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example because the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify continued market exclusivity. Market exclusivity can be revoked only in very selected cases, such as consent from the marketing authorization holder, inability to supply sufficient quantities of the product, demonstration of clinically relevant superiority by a similar medicinal product or, after a review by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, requested by a Member State in the fifth year of the marketing exclusivity period (if the designation criteria are believed to no longer apply). Medicinal products designated as orphan drugs are eligible for incentives made available by the EU and by its Member States to support research into and the development and availability of orphan drugs. It is not our current intention to pursue orphan drug designation for SM-88.
Regulatory Data Protection 
 Without prejudice to the law on the protection of industrial and commercial property, marketing authorizations for new medicinal products in the EU benefit from an 8+2+1 year period of regulatory protection. 
 This regime consists of a regulatory data protection period of eight years plus a concurrent market exclusivity of ten years plus an additional market exclusivity of one additional year if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing approval holder obtains an approval for one or more new therapeutic indications that, during the scientific evaluation prior to their approval, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Under the current rules, a third party may reference the preclinical and clinical data of the reference product beginning eight years after first approval, but the third party may market a generic version only after ten (or eleven) years have lapsed. Additional regulatory data protection can be applied for when an applicant has complied with all requirements as set forth in an approved PIP. 
 International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) 
 The International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) is a project that brings together the regulatory authorities of Europe, Japan and the U.S. and experts from the pharmaceutical industry in the three regions to discuss scientific and technical aspects of pharmaceutical product registration. The purpose of ICH is to reduce or obviate the need to duplicate the testing carried out during the research and development of new medicines by recommending ways to achieve greater harmonization in the interpretation and application of technical guidelines and requirements for product registration. Harmonization would lead to a more economical use of human, animal and material resources, the elimination of unnecessary delay in the global development and availability of new medicines, while maintaining safeguards on quality, safety, efficacy and regulatory obligations to protect public health.

ICH guidelines have been adopted as law in many countries, but are only used as guidance in the U.S. by the FDA. In many areas of drug regulation, ICH has resulted in comparable requirements, for instance with respect to the Common Technical Document, which has become the core document for filings for market authorization in several jurisdictions. In this manner, ICH has facilitated a more efficient path to markets. 
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 As previously noted, in the U.S. and other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The division of competences within the EU leaves to its Member States the power to organize their own social security systems, including health care policies to promote the financial stability of their health care insurance systems. 
 In this context, each of the Member States national authorities is free to set the prices of medicinal products and to designate the treatments that they wish to reimburse under their social security system. However, the EU has defined a common procedural framework through the adoption what is generally known as the Transparency Directive. This directive aims to ensure that national pricing and reimbursement decisions are made in a transparent manner and do not disrupt the operation of the internal market. 
 The pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement systems established by Member States are usually quite complex. Each country uses different schemes and policies, adapted to its own economic and health needs. We would have to develop or access special expertise in this field to prepare health economic dossiers on our medicinal products if we would market our products, if and when approved, in the EU. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no near-term plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely on and expect to continue to rely on, third party contract manufacturers for supplies of SM-88 for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for the initial commercial manufacture of any products that we may market following regulatory approval. 
 We currently purchase all our drug substance and drug products from contract manufacturers and intend to continue to do so on an as-needed purchase order basis. We have entered into limited -term supply arrangements for certain SM-88 components related to supply for our clinical activities in order to secure favorable pricing terms. We intend to identify and qualify any further necessary contract manufacturers to provide all active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and finished drug product services during the IND stages and before submission of an NDA to the FDA. 
 Our current intention is that, during the course of the IND program through the End-of-Phase II (EOP2), we will conduct the manufacturing, CMC and GMP programs towards commercial manufacturing. The overall manufacturing program includes, but is not limited to, the development of product and process specifications, producing and validating standards and the development of suitable analytical methods for test and release, as well as stability testing. Before and during the use of contract manufacturers, we (or qualified designee) will conduct audits to ensure compliance with the mutually agreed process descriptions and cGMP regulations. Our manufacturers themselves must comply with their in-house quality assurance programs and be available for inspections by regulatory agencies, including the FDA and European drug regulatory agencies. During the development of our drug candidates, we anticipate scaling the manufacturing process to a suitable size. Increasing scale involves several steps and may involve modification of the process, in which case modifications to our CMC sections will occur, with continuous submissions to the FDA and EU regulatory authorities. 
 As we progress through the regulatory approval process, there is a possibility that our intended manufacturing process will undergo modifications, primarily based on initial manufacturing results and data generated during the manufacture of drug substance and product to be used in our clinical trials. Modifications could cause delays in obtaining regulatory approval of SM-88, if at all, as well increase our research and development and manufacturing costs and potentially make such product costs prohibitive to our intended end users and their medical insurance providers.

SM-88 is a combination drug that is comprised of four active ingredients. Three of the components of SM-88 previously received regulatory approval in areas other than cancer treatment. The four active ingredients that comprise SM-88 are organic compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules. They can be manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry is amenable to scale-up and we do not believe unusual equipment could be required in the manufacturing process. 
 Our tyrosine-based component is a derivative product that has been modified by a proprietary process to modify its functionality. This drug substance is being manufactured on an exclusive basis by a leading, FDA-audited contract manufacturer that has previously manufactured tyrosine-based products on a commercial scale. This manufacturer currently is our sole supplier of this drug substance. To our knowledge, the current manufacturer of this drug substance is the only FDA-approved supplier of this drug. We believe this cGMP contract manufacturer has sufficient capacity to meet our projected needs into the near future and we maintain inventory on hand to meet our immediate clinical needs. In the event of a catastrophic event or if this contract manufacturer is unable to meet our needs, we will need to find an alternative source. This will likely result in delays for the clinical development program. It is not impossible to find a substitute for this supplier in the event that it becomes necessary, but it may be costly in terms of development time. We do not currently have arrangements in place for a redundant supply of the drug substance. 
 To date, we have, through an FDA-audited contract manufacturer, produced cGMP drug substance for use in our planned clinical trials. In addition, we have produced cGMP clinical trial materials utilizing such drug substance, through a FDA-audited contract manufacturer. Such newly produced drug substance and clinical trial materials are currently undergoing long term regulatory testing. We believe we have produced enough drug substance to create an inventory to meet our immediate needs regarding our planned clinical trials. 
 For future work involving the drug product, it is anticipated that manufacture process development work will continue, with focus of manufacturing improvements, and increasing scale. It is anticipated that future manufacturing of clinical trial materials may be required to fill clinical trial needs. Additional tyrosine derivative drug product variations have also been developed for research purposes and some are being validated and tested for clinical purposes. 
 The remaining three APIs in SM-88 are available from several contract manufacturers, each holding Drug Master Files at the FDA for their respective APIs. We believe that the loss of or the inability of, any of single source to provide our required ingredients would not have any substantive delaying effect on our research program, clinical trials or future commercial sale of SM-88, as we believe other sources are readily available. 
 Research and development expenses were $8,839,661 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, $6,111,587 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, $3,823,966 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and $808,472 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. 
 Employees 
 As of March 31, 2018, we had a total of 11 full-time employees, all located in the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Of the 11 employees, six perform research and development activities and 5 serve in general and administrative functions. Our Chief Executive Officer, Steve Hoffman, is also our Chief Science Officer and, as such, may be considered engaged in R&D activities, for purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, as well as his being categorized as serving in an administrative capacity Based upon their roles and activities with the Company, certain other employees may also be categorized as serving in more than one role. Where necessary, we have entered into consulting contracts to provide us with subject matter expertise. We believe there is available a sufficient number of contractors with appropriate subject matter expertise for our current and near-term needs.

 Corporate History; Significant Organizational Events 
 Overview 
 We were originally incorporated in Florida as Global Group Enterprises Corp. on November 22, 2011. Effective as of September 18, 2014, we reincorporated in the State of Delaware and later engaged in a merger and certain other transactions (described under the sub-captions below). As a result of these events, among other things, 
 

 | we changed our jurisdiction of incorporation from Florida to Delaware;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | we changed our name from Global Group Enterprises Corp. to Tyme Technologies, Inc.;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | we increased our authorized capital stock from 250,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, (Common Stock) to 300,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Subsequent to this organizational merger, we entered into a merger in 2015, whereby we acquired our current clinical-stage pharmaceutical business. The effects of such 2015 merger and associated financing transactions are described below under Merger Agreement. 
 Merger Agreement 
 On March 5, 2015, we, our wholly-owned subsidiary formed for the purposes of completing the merger (which we refer to as Acquisition Sub), Tyme, Inc. (Tyme) and certain other parties entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the Merger Agreement). Simultaneous with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we and the other parties to the Merger Agreement consummated the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the Merger). We refer to the date that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, were consummated as the Closing Date. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Acquisition Sub merged with and into Tyme. Tyme was the surviving corporation in the Merger and thus became our wholly-owned subsidiary. 
 In accordance with the Merger Agreement, we also completed a split-off transaction whereby we transferred all of our pre-Merger assets and liabilities to a newly formed subsidiary, Global Group Enterprises Corp., a Florida corporation (Split-Off Subsidiary), and transferred our entire equity interest in Split-Off Sub to our pre-Merger principal stockholder, who was a founder and former executive officer (the Split-Off). The Split-Off was effected in consideration for the surrender to us for cancellation of all of this founders 13,000,200 shares of our Common Stock. For further details, see Split-Off Transaction below. As a result of the consummation of the Merger and Split-Off Transaction, our sole business became the business of Tyme, a research and development company focused on developing drug candidates for the treatment of cancer in humans. 
 At the closing of the Merger, the shares of Tymes common stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger were converted into shares of our Common Stock, resulting in an aggregate of 68 million shares of our Common Stock being issued in connection with the Merger to the holders of Tymes common stock immediately preceding the effective time of the Merger (the Pre-Merger Tyme Stockholders). 
 The Merger Agreement contained representations and warranties and pre- and post-closing covenants of each party and customary closing conditions. Breaches of the representations and warranties under the Merger Agreement are subject to indemnification provisions. Each of the Pre-Merger Tyme Stockholders initially received in the Merger 95% of the shares to which each such stockholder was entitled under the terms of the Merger Agreement, with the remaining 5% of such shares being held in escrow for two years to satisfy post-closing claims for indemnification by the Company and then distributed in June of 2017. The Merger Agreement also contained a 
 
23 
 
 provision providing for a post-Merger share issuance, as a means for which claims for indemnity may be made by the Pre-Merger Tyme Stockholders. Pursuant to this provision, up to one million additional shares (R&W Shares) of our Common Stock could have been issued to the Pre-Merger Tyme Stockholders during the one-year period following the Merger for breaches of representations and warranties of the pre-Merger Company contained in the Merger Agreement. The foregoing mechanisms are the exclusive remedies of the Company on the one hand and the Pre-Merger Tyme Stockholders on the other hand for satisfying indemnification claims under the Merger Agreement, other than claims based on fraud or willful misconduct. 
 The Merger Agreement also called for the surrender for cancellation, effective as of the Merger Closing, of a number of shares of our Common Stock by the owners of such shares. In addition to the surrender and cancellation of 13,000,200 shares in connection with the Split-Off transaction, a further 26,276,600 shares (the Merger Related Surrendered Shares) were surrendered by their owners and canceled. 
 The Merger was treated as a recapitalization or reverse acquisition for financial accounting purposes. Tyme is considered the acquirer for accounting purposes and our historical financial statements before the Merger have been replaced by the historical financial statements of Tyme before the Merger. 
 The Merger is intended to be treated as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 
 The issuance of shares of our Common Stock to holders of Tymes common stock in connection with the Merger was not registered under the Securities Act, in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, which exempts transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering. These securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirement and are subject to further contractual restrictions on transfer as described below. 
 We and the Pre-Merger Tyme Stockholders entered into additional agreements concerning the registration or sale of shares of our Common Stock, in certain circumstances, the terms of which have expired prior to March 31, 2018. 
 All descriptions of the Merger Agreement, herein are qualified in their entireties by reference to the texts thereof incorporated by reference herein and listed as an exhibit hereto.
Split-Off Transaction 
 Immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, under the terms of a Split-Off Agreement and a General release agreement, we effected the Split-Off, whereby we (x) transferred all of our pre-Merger operating assets and liabilities to Split-Off Subsidiary, our wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary and (y) transferred all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Split-Off Subsidiary to Andrew Keck, our founder and a principal stockholder of our Company prior to the consummation of the Merger, in consideration of and in exchange for (i) the surrender for cancellation of an aggregate of 13,000,200 shares of our Common Stock owned by him and (ii) certain representations, covenants and indemnities Split-off. Mr. Keck served as our sole executive officer and director from our initial formation through April 26, 2013. 
 Bridge Financing by Tyme 
 In July 2014, Tyme offered and sold to an accredited investor a Tyme senior subordinated secured convertible note in the principal amount of $1.1 million. The note bore interest at 10% per annum and was payable on October 11, 2015, subject to earlier conversion as described below. In November of 2014, the holder of such note loaned Tyme an additional $250,000 and the note was amended and restated to reflect a principal amount of $1.35 million. In January of 2015, the holder of such note loaned Tyme an additional $960,000 and the note was further amended and restated to reflect a principal amount of $2.31 million. In February of 2015, the note was further amended to reflect a change in its mandatory conversion feature to a fixed amount, as further discussed below. The note as amended and restated is referred to in this report as the Bridge Note. 
 
24 
 
Interest on the bridge note would have been payable at maturity; however, upon conversion of the Bridge Note as described below, accrued interest was, in accordance with the terms of the bridge note, forgiven. The bridge note was secured by a security interest on all of the assets of Tyme and its Luminant Biosciences, LLC wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyme (Luminant), subject to certain limited exceptions, as well as a pledge of certain shares of stock of Tyme then held by two principal stockholders of Tyme and Tymes membership interest in Luminant. 
 Upon the closing of the Merger and the private placement offering (the PPO) (described below), the outstanding principal amount of the Bridge Note was automatically converted into 2.31 million shares (the Conversion Shares) of our Common Stock, at a rate of one share for every $1.00 of Bridge Note principal then outstanding. The security interest and pledges terminated upon conversion of the Bridge Note. 
 The PPO and PPO Note 
 Concurrently with the closing of the Merger and in contemplation of the Merger, we held a closing of a PPO in which we sold 2.716 million shares of our Common Stock at a purchase price of $2.50 per share for gross proceeds of $6.79 million. Only $4.29 million of such gross proceeds was paid in cash. The remaining $2.5 million was paid by the delivery to us of a 90-day, limited recourse promissory note in the principal amount of $2.5 million (the PPO Note). The PPO Note was secured by an escrow of five million shares of our Common Stock, pursuant to a Subscription Note Shares Escrow Agreement among us, the purchaser in the PPO and an escrow agent (the PPO Note Escrow Agreement). 
 The PPO Note had an original maturity date of June 5, 2015. Under an Omnibus Amendment, dated as of June 5, 2015, among Christopher Brown, GEM Global Yield Fund LLC SCS (GEM) and us, among other matters, GEM made a payment to us equal to one-half of the original principal amount of the PPO Note and we extended the maturity date with respect to the balance due under the PPO Note ($1,250,000 in principal amount) to July 6, 2015. Following such receipt of one-half of the PPO Note, 2,500,000 of such shares were released from escrow and the remaining 2,500,000 shares remained in escrow. We entered into a Second Omnibus Amendment as of July 23, 2015 (the Second Omnibus Amendment), pursuant to which, among other matters, we agreed to the extension of the maturity date of the remaining $1,250,000 outstanding amount due under the PPO Note to a date which is five business days following the date on which we provide the maker of the PPO Note with written evidence that the IND for our SM-88 drug candidate has been submitted by us to the FDA. The IND was received by the FDA on September 21, 2015 and notice of such was given to the maker of the PPO Note on September 25, 2015. Subsequently, the remaining $1,250,000 PPO Note balance was paid and we authorized the release of the 2,500,000 shares then remaining in escrow. 
 The PPO was exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The sole investor in the PPO was GEM. The Bridge Note investor designated GEM as the party to receive the Conversion Shares. GEM was a principal stockholder of our pre-Merger company, and the purchaser of the Bridge Note is the manager of GEM. 
 The closing of the PPO and the closing of the Merger were conditioned upon each other. 
 At-the-Market Sales of Common Stock 
 On November 2, 2017, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with Canaccord Genuity Inc. (Canaccord), pursuant to which we may, from time to time, sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $30,000,000 through Canaccord, as our sales agent, in an at-the-market offering (the ATM Financing Facility). Since initiation, we have sold 1,543,364 shares of our common stock under this equity distribution agreement for net proceeds of $5,967,415 and paid Canaccord aggregate commissions of $184,559. 
 Public Stock Offering 
 On March 6, 2018, Tyme closed an underwritten public offering of 10.4 million shares of its Common Stock, at a public offering price of $2.25 per share and received net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before our expenses of the offering, of approximately $21.89 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for research and further development of its lead clinical program SM-88 and for 
 
25 
 
 general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, working capital and general and administrative expenses. The Company may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies that are complementary to its own, although it has no current plans, commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions as of the date hereof.
