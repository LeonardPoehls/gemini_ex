Item 1. Business
Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on December 12, 2014 as a business company with limited liability. This means that our shareholders have no additional liability for the company’s liabilities over and above the amount paid for their shares. We were formed for the purpose of entering into an initial business combination with one or more target businesses, which we refer to in this report as the initial business combination. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, although we intend to focus our search on target businesses and assets in the metals and mining industry, with an emphasis on gold and other precious metals.
 
We are led by our management team of Thomas S. Kaplan, our Chairman, and Eric N. Vincent, our Chief Executive Officer. Messrs. Kaplan and Vincent are officers of our sponsor and TEG, a privately held global natural resources investment management company that manages the assets of Mr. Kaplan and other institutional investors. TEG is the investment advisor to Electrum Strategic Opportunities Fund L.P., or ESOF, the majority owner of the sponsor, and will assist Messrs. Kaplan and Vincent in the sourcing, evaluation and execution of investment opportunities.
 
Over the course of their careers, Messrs. Kaplan and Vincent have developed a broad international network of contacts and corporate relationships that we believe will serve as a useful source of investment opportunities. We will seek to capitalize on the global network and investing and operating experience of our management team to identify, acquire and operate one or more businesses or assets in the metals and mining industry within or outside of the United States, although we may pursue a business combination outside of this industry. In the event that we elect to pursue an investment outside of metals and mining, our management’s expertise related to that industry may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained herein regarding this industry might not be relevant to an understanding of the business or asset that we elect to acquire.
 
We believe that our management team is well positioned to take advantage of investment opportunities and that TEG’s deep domain expertise and broad global network will allow us to identify, evaluate and consummate a business combination. Notably, we believe that the current market environment, which has forced many metal and mining companies into a state of distress, has significantly increased the number of investment opportunities in the sector. However, there is no assurance that we will complete an initial business combination nor is there any guarantee that such initial business combination will be successful. The members of our management team are not required to devote any significant amount of time to our business and are concurrently involved with other businesses. There is no guarantee that our current officers and directors will continue in their respective roles, or in any other role, after our initial business combination, and their expertise may only be of benefit to us until our initial business combination is completed, if at all.
 
The registration statements on Form S-1 (Nos. 333-203599 and 333-204866), which we refer to collectively as our “registration statement,” for our initial public offering were declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on June 10, 2015. On June 16, 2015, we consummated our initial public offering and sold 20,000,000 units, including 2,500,000 units issued pursuant to the partial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. Each unit consists of one ordinary share and one warrant to purchase one-half of one ordinary share at a price of $5.75 per half share, subject to adjustment as described in our registration statement. Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of ordinary shares. Each warrant will become exercisable 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination, and will expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination, or earlier upon redemption. In connection with the closing of our initial public offering, the underwriters notified us that they would not be exercising the remainder of their over-allotment option. As a result, our initial shareholders forfeited an aggregate of 31,250 ordinary shares so that the initial shareholders continued to collectively own 20.0% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares after the offering.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, our sponsor and an entity controlled by Dwight W. Anderson, one of our directors, purchased an aggregate of 14,050,000 private placement warrants at a price of $0.50 per warrant in a private placement. We received net proceeds of approximately $201,175,000 from our initial public offering and sale of the private placement warrants, net of the non-deferred portion of the underwriting commissions and underwriter advisory fees of $5,250,000 and offering costs and other expenses of approximately $600,000. Of those net proceeds, a total of $6,750,000 is attributable to deferred underwriting discounts and underwriter advisory fees, which have been deferred until the consummation of our initial business combination. $200,000,000 of the net proceeds were deposited in a trust account. Except for a portion of the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay any income or other tax obligations, none of the funds held in the trust account will be released until the earlier of the completion of our initial business combination and the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are unable to consummate a business combination by February 5, 2018, or June 5, 2018, if our shareholders approve amending our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association at the meeting of our shareholders scheduled to occur on February 2, 2018 (such deadline to consummate a business combination, the “Business Combination Deadline”). If we do not complete a business combination by the Business Combination Deadline, we will distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account pro rata to our public shareholders by way of redemption and cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up of our affairs.

On June 5, 2017, our shareholders approved a proposal to extend the Business Combination Deadline until October 8, 2017 (the “First Extension”). In connection with the First Extension, our sponsor agreed to contribute to us as a loan $0.025 for each public share that is not redeemed, for each calendar month (commencing on June 10, 2017 and on the 10th day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that is needed by us to complete a business combination from June 10, 2017 until October 8, 2017. Our sponsor agreed to continue to make this contribution through February 5, 2018 in connection with our shareholders’ approval of a proposal at a special meeting held on October 5, 2017 to extend the Business Combination Deadline until February 5, 2018 (the “Second Extension”). We have filed a definitive proxy statement with respect to a meeting of our shareholders scheduled to occur on February 2, 2018, to vote on, among other things, an amendment (the “Extension Amendment”) to our memorandum and articles of association to extend the Business Combination Deadline (the “Extension”) for an additional four months, from February 5, 2018 to June 5, 2018 (the “Extended Date”). Our sponsor has agreed to contribute to us as a loan $0.035 for each public share that is not redeemed in connection with the shareholder vote to approve the Extension, for each calendar month, or portion thereof, that is needed by us to complete a business combination. In connection with the First Extension, 3,937,943 of our ordinary shares were redeemed, and in connection with the Second Extension, 3,031,985 of our ordinary shares were redeemed. Our public shareholders have the opportunity to redeem their ordinary shares in connection with the proposed Extension Amendment, as described in our proxy statement relating to the meeting of shareholders to be held on February 2, 2018.
 
Business Strategy
 
We believe that current market conditions in the metals and mining industry, particularly with gold and other precious metals, should present the Company with attractive acquisition opportunities. We intend to focus primarily on acquiring companies or assets valued between $150 million and $800 million of enterprise value. We believe the metals and mining industry represents an attractive sector to search for target businesses for the following reasons:
Capital Constraints.  The exploration, development and production of mining assets require substantial funding. As a result of trends in the mining industry, including the declines in precious metals prices from their peak in 2011, declining grades, rising costs, unmet guidance, and resource nationalism, many mining companies are experiencing difficulty attracting the significant capital needed to permit the exploration, development or production of their assets.
Distressed Sales.  Mining companies may find themselves overleveraged and with the need to dispose of assets or sell controlling interests to raise proceeds to repay indebtedness.
 
Historically Low Valuations.  Gold mining company valuations have fallen sharply from peak levels. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) was trading 65% below its September 2011 peak as of December 31, 2017, and the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDX-J) had declined by 81% from its December 2010 peak, data from Bloomberg indicates.
 
We believe that these factors may cause mining companies to seek a merger partner or to dispose of assets that may represent attractive acquisition opportunities. We believe that our capital resources, together with the industry, transactional and operational experience of our management team, should position us to take advantage of these opportunities. Additionally, we believe our management team’s capabilities, including access to geologists, engineers and mining industry professionals with substantial industry experience, should provide us a competitive advantage in identifying and evaluating attractive opportunities and completing transactions through the ability to act quickly and efficiently. These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.
 
We intend to implement our business through disciplined valuation analyses and a rigorous due diligence and acquisition process that includes the following elements:
 
Identifying opportunities.  We believe that the relationships and industry experience of our management team should enable us to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. We intend to utilize a research-intensive, analytical process to source investment opportunities. Our management team believes its reputation as a trusted strategic partner with meaningful operational, geological and technical expertise creates opportunities to invest in businesses that are not as easily identified by traditional financial buyers.

Executing proficiently.  We believe that the due diligence capabilities available to our management team, including geologists, engineers and experienced transactional professionals, should provide us the ability to evaluate the technical and geological merits of potential investments, and complete acquisition opportunities proficiently.
 
Improving operations and strategies.  We believe that the industry and operational experience of our management team and its broad network of industry relationships should enable us to improve the strategic and operational performance of the assets and businesses that we acquire.
 
Engaging in corporate development.  We believe that the industry experience of our management team should enable us to recruit highly qualified executives to manage the assets and businesses we acquire.
 
Value maximization.  We believe that the industry and transactional experience of our management team should enable us to identify opportunities to maximize the value of the assets and businesses we acquire, including through dispositions, capital transactions and joint ventures. Additionally, we believe that our management team will be viewed as a value-added partner to target companies by providing strategic, technical and financial advice, including reinterpretation of geological data, lending TEG’s deep domain expertise to effect operational improvement, introducing the target company to new institutional investors, and attracting equity research coverage.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe our competitive strengths to be the following:
 
Status as a public company.  We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses might find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, roadshow and public reporting efforts that will likely not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. Furthermore, once the business combination is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests than it would have as a privately-held company. Being public can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
While we believe that our status as a public company will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view the inherent limitations in our status as a blank check company as a deterrent and may prefer to effect a business combination with a more established entity or with a private company.
 
Financial position.  With funds held in trust available for our initial business combination in the amount of approximately $133.7 million as of November 30, 2017, we offer a target business a variety of options such as providing the owners of a target business with shares in a public company and a public means to sell such shares, providing cash for stock, and providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to consummate our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and it may not be available to us.
 
Management Operating and Investing Experience.  Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad international network of contacts and corporate relationships which we believe will serve as a useful source of investment opportunities. We will seek to capitalize on the global network and investing and operating experience of our management team to identify, acquire and operate one or more businesses or assets in the mining industry, although we may pursue a business combination outside of the mining industry. Our executive officers are officers of our sponsor and TEG, a privately held global natural resources investment management company that manages the assets of Mr. Kaplan and other institutional investors. Mr. Kaplan has applied his deep understanding of historical precedents to the natural resources markets and established his reputation as one of the thought leaders within the precious metals sector. Over the last two decades, Mr. Kaplan has assembled a team of natural resources and investment professionals to pursue investments across the industry.

TEG has demonstrated an ability to transact successfully in the natural resources sector globally, generating significant returns by investing in high-quality exploration and development opportunities that they believed would outperform the markets. Over the last 20 years, Mr. Kaplan and the TEG management team have made multiple successful investments through various commodity cycles across a wide spectrum of the natural resources industry, including in gold, silver, platinum, copper, gas and hydrocarbons.
 
Assistance from TEG. In addition to Mr. Kaplan and Mr. Vincent, we expect TEG employees and consultants to help identify target businesses and assist with the due diligence and the transaction execution for us in connection with a business combination. None of these individuals are required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs. TEG is the investment advisor to ESOF, which is the majority owner of the sponsor.
 
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business unless and until we consummate a business combination. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of private warrants, our shares, debt or a combination of these in effecting our initial business combination. Although substantially all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of private warrants are intended to be applied generally toward effecting a business combination as described in this report, the proceeds are not otherwise being designated for any more specific purposes. Accordingly, investors in our securities are investing without first having an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any one or more business combinations. Our initial business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various Federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination.
Sources of Target Businesses
 
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read our registration statement and the other reports we file with the SEC and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. We may also engage professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We have no present intention to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or sponsor. However, we are not restricted from entering into any such transactions and may do so if (1) such transaction is approved by a majority of our disinterested and independent directors (if we have any at that time) and (2) we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated shareholders from a financial point of view. As of the date of this report, there are no affiliated entities that we would consider as a business combination target.
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination
 
Subject to the limitation that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. Except for the general criteria and guidelines set forth above under the caption “Business Strategy,” we have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. Furthermore, we do not have any specific requirements with respect to the value of a prospective target business as compared to our net assets or the funds held in the trust account.
 
Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage.

The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination remain to be determined. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.
 
Fair Market Value of Target Business
 
Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance. We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure a business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction parent company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we or a newly formed public holding company issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of the outstanding shares of the public parent company subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% trust account balance test. In order to consummate such an acquisition, we may issue a significant amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a public or private offering of debt or equity securities. Since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not entered into any such fund raising arrangement and have no current intention of doing so. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold.
Lack of Business Diversification
 
We expect to complete only a single business combination, although this process may entail the simultaneous acquisitions of several operating businesses. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business operation. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

· | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial business combination;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | result in our dependency upon the successful development, construction and operation of a single mining asset; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business.
 
Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’s Management Team
 
Although we intend to scrutinize the management team of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination, our assessment of the target business’ management team may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management team may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following our initial business combination remains to be determined. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full time efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of our initial business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of our initial business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, our officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
Following our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We may not have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination
 
In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our shareholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case based on the number of public shares outstanding and subject to the limitations described herein. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each shareholder may tender all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. Unlike other blank check companies which require shareholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and related redemptions of public shares for cash upon consummation of such initial business combination even when a vote is not required by law, we will have the flexibility to avoid such shareholder vote and allow our shareholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
 
We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability to consummate such initial business combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares redeemed or sold to us) and may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public shareholders may therefore have to wait until the Business Combination Deadline in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.

Our sponsor and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any ordinary shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to redeem any ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any ordinary shares in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination.
 
None of our officers, directors, sponsor or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase units or ordinary shares in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of shareholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, sponsor or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, sponsor and their affiliates will not make purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.
 
Redemption Rights
 
At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, any public shareholder, whether voting for or against such proposed business combination, will be entitled to demand that his ordinary shares be redeemed for a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the trust account (initially $10.00 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes or for working capital). Alternatively, we may provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their ordinary shares to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of his or any other person with whom he is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to 20% or more of the ordinary shares sold in our initial public offering. Accordingly, if you purchase more than 20% of the ordinary shares sold in our initial public offering and our proposed business combination is approved, you will not be able to seek redemption rights with respect to the full amount of your shares and may be forced to hold such additional ordinary shares or sell them in the open market. Such a public shareholder would still be entitled to vote against a proposed business combination with respect to all ordinary shares owned by him or his affiliates. We believe this restriction will prevent shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares before the vote held to approve a proposed business combination and attempt to use the redemption right as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a substantial premium to the then current market price.
 
Our sponsor, as well as our officers and directors, will not have redemption rights with respect to any ordinary shares owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to our initial public offering or, except in the case of our liquidation if we do not complete a business combination as described below, purchased by them in our initial public offering or in the aftermarket.
 
We may also require public shareholders who wish to redeem, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent at any time through the vote on the business combination or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders to deliver their shares prior to the vote on the business combination in order to exercise redemption rights. This is because a holder would need to deliver shares to exercise redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require shareholders to exercise redemption rights prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to shareholders.
 
Any request to redeem such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their redemption and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
 
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to have their shares redeemed.

Liquidation if No Business Combination
 
If we do not complete a business combination by the Business Combination Deadline, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account pro rata to our public shareholders by way of redemption and cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up of our affairs. This redemption of public shareholders from the trust account shall be done automatically by function of our memorandum and articles of association and prior to any voluntary winding up, although at all times subject to the Companies Act.
 
Following the redemption of public shares, we intend to enter “voluntary liquidation” which is the statutory process for formally closing and dissolving a company under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. Given that we intend to enter voluntary liquidation following the redemption of public shareholders from the trust account, we do not expect that the voluntary liquidation process will cause any delay to the payment of redemption proceeds from our trust account. In connection with such a voluntary liquidation, the liquidator would give notice to creditors inviting them to submit their claims for payment, by notifying known creditors (if any) who have not submitted claims and by placing a public advertisement in at least one newspaper published in the British Virgin Islands newspaper and in at least one newspaper circulating in the location where the company has its principal place of business, and taking any other steps he considers appropriate to identify the company’s creditors, after which our remaining assets would be distributed. As soon as the affairs of the company are fully wound-up, the liquidator must complete his statement of account and make a notificational filing with the Registrar. We would be dissolved once the Registrar issues a Certificate of Dissolution.
 
Our sponsor has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its insider shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the applicable period from the closing of our initial public offering.
 
However, if our sponsor, or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquire public shares after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination by the Business Combination Deadline. We will pay the costs of our liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. However, the liquidator may determine that he or it requires additional time to evaluate creditors’ claims (particularly if there is uncertainty over the validity or extent of the claims of any creditors). Also, a creditor or shareholder may file a petition with the BVI court which, if successful, may result in our liquidation being subject to the supervision of that court. Such events might delay distribution of some or all of our remaining assets.
 
Additionally, in any liquidation proceedings of the company under British Virgin Islands law, the funds held in our trust account may be included in our estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any such claims deplete the trust account we may not be able to return to our public shareholders the liquidation amounts payable to them.
 
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors, which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. The actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.00, plus interest (net of any taxes payable).
 
Although we seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, ESOF agreed that it will be liable to us, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below $10.00 per share (whether or not the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, ESOF will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. However, ESOF may not be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. We have not independently verified whether ESOF has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations. We believe the likelihood of ESOF having to indemnify the trust account is limited because we will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as well as other entities execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account.

In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below $10.00 per share and ESOF asserts that it is unable to satisfy any applicable obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against ESOF to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against ESOF to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, due to claims of creditors, the actual value of the per-share redemption price may be less than $10.00 per share.
 
We seek to reduce the possibility that ESOF will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. ESOF will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to the remaining portion, if any, of any founds outside of the trust account, and the interest income earned on the balance of the trust account (net of taxes payable) with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $20,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.
 
If we are deemed insolvent for the purposes of the Insolvency Act (i.e. (i) we fail to comply with the requirements of a statutory demand that has not been set aside under section 157 of the Insolvency Act; (ii) execution or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of a British Virgin Islands Court in favor of a creditor of the company is returned wholly or partly unsatisfied; or (iii) either the value of the company’s liabilities exceeds its assets, or the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due), then there are very limited circumstances where prior payments made to shareholders or other parties may be deemed to be a “voidable transaction” for the purposes of the Insolvency Act. A voidable transaction would include, for these purposes, payments made as “unfair preferences” or “transactions at an undervalue”. A liquidator appointed over an insolvent company who considers that a particular transaction or payment is a voidable transaction under the Insolvency Act could apply to the British Virgin Islands Courts for an order setting aside that payment or transaction in whole or in part.
 
Additionally, if we enter insolvent liquidation under the Insolvency Act, the funds held in our trust account will likely be included in our estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any insolvency claims deplete the trust account you may not be able to return to our public shareholders the liquidation amounts due them.
 
Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of a redemption to public shareholders prior to any winding up in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination or our liquidation or if they redeem their shares in connection with an initial business combination that we consummate. In no other circumstances shall a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.

The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
 

· | our obligation to seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our obligation to redeem ordinary shares held by our public shareholders may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our outstanding warrants, and the potential future dilution they represent;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our obligation to either repay or issue private warrants upon conversion of up to $1,000,000 of working capital loans that may be made to us by our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates, and our obligation to repay loans made to us by our sponsor in connection with the extensions of our Business Combination Deadline; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the private warrants (and underlying securities) and any securities issued to our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
 
If we succeed in effecting our initial business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. Subsequent to our initial business combination, we may not have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 
Employees
 
We have two executive officers, neither of whom is paid a salary by us. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to acquire has been located, management will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements
 
We have registered our units, ordinary shares and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. These filings are available to the public via the Internet at the SEC’s website located at http://www.sec.gov. You may also read and copy any document that we file with the SEC at the SEC’s public reference room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. For more information, please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. You may request a copy of our filings with the SEC (excluding exhibits) at no cost by writing or telephoning us at the following address or telephone number:
Electrum Special Acquisition Corp.
 c/o The Electrum Group LLC
 700 Madison Avenue, 5th Floor
 New York, NY 10065
 Tel: (646) 365-1600
 
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to U.S. GAAP or IFRS as issued by the IASB. To the extent we furnish our shareholders with financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, such financial statements will need to be audited in accordance with U.S. GAAP at the time of the consummation of the business combination. A particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate may not have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.

We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2017 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act and will remain such for up to five years. However, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period or our total revenues exceed $1.17 billion or the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, we have elected, under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
