Effective May 26, 2006, a business combination occurred between Sancon Recycling Pty Ltd. (“SRPL”) and MKA Capital Inc. (hereinafter referred to as "MKAC"). The combination was effected by MKAC exchange its seventy-five percent (75%) equity stake in MK Aviation, S.A.

Meanwhile, the Shareholders exchanged their ownership of seventy-five percent (75%) equity stake in MK Aviation, S.A. with 14,897,215 shares of the Registrant's common stock from Mr. Kraselnick and associated parties.

SRPL did not recognize goodwill or any intangible assets in connection with the transaction.

Overview of the Company and its Operations
 
The Company is a controlled corporation with the substantial majority of our shares held by Pontoon Boat Inc. (“Pontoon”), a company registered in the Republic of Vanuatu. Pontoon acquired a 51% common shares of the Company in July 2016. As a result, there can be no assurance that business and/or strategy of the Company will not change over time as a result of Pontoon’s acquisition.
 
IGS Mart is a company incorporated in Malaysia on June 2, 2017. It currently operates one convenient store named Like Mart at G-3A Tiara Mutiara 139, Jalan Puchong, 58200 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. IGS Mart intends to open an additional 5 convenient stores in Malaysia over the next 15 months. Although there is no assurance of success, the Company believes that there is a good opportunity for expansion of many more outlets after the brand is established.
 
The directors are always on the look-out for viable business that the Company can acquire in Asia.

Our Strategy
 
We do not currently engage in any business activity. Our principal business objective will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings.
 
We may consider a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.
 
Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies.
 
Our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only on business combination, due primarily to our limited financing, and the dilution of interest for current stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management's plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve tax free reorganization.
 
Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.
 
Evaluation of Business Combinations
 
Our management intends to concentrate on prospective business combinations that may be brought to its attention through their own efforts, through persons having pre-existing business or personal relationships with members of the Company's management and interested persons referred to the Company by persons having such pre-existing relationships with members of its management or other third parties.
 
While we have not established definitive criteria for acquisition candidates but intend to focus on Asian-based entities. In analyzing prospective business combinations, our management will also consider such matters as the following:
 

· | Available technical, financial, and managerial resources,
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | Working capital and other financial requirements,
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | Prospects for the future,
--+--------------------------


· | Nature of present and expected competition,
--+--------------------------------------------


· | The potential for further research, development, or exploration,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | The potential for growth or expansion, and
--+-------------------------------------------


· | The potential for profit.
--+--------------------------



As a part of our investigation, our officers and/or directors will meet personally with management and key personnel, visit and inspect material facilities, check references of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of our limited financial resources and management expertise.

Factors That May Affect Future Results
 
The Company's ability to execute its business strategy and to sustain its operations depends upon its ability to maintain or procure capital. There can be no absolute assurance the necessary amount of capital will continue to be available to the Company on favorable terms, or at all. The Company's inability to obtain sufficient capital would limit the Company's ability to: (i) acquire new business and (ii) fund its working capital needs. The Company's access to capital may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.
 
There can be no absolute assurance the Company will be able to effectively manage its existing or the possible future expansion of its operations, or the Company's systems, procedures or controls will be adequate to support the Company's operations. Consequently, the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations could be possibly and adversely affected.
 
As a public company, IGS is subject to certain regulatory requirements including, but not limited to, compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX404"). Such compliance results in significant additional costs to the Company by increased audit and consulting fees, and the time required by management to address the regulations.
