ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General
We are a growth-oriented master limited partnership formed by CONSOL Energy to manage and further develop all of its active coal operations in Pennsylvania. At December 31, 2016, our assets include a 25% undivided interest in, and operational control over, CONSOL Energy's Pennsylvania Mining Complex, which consists of three underground mines and related infrastructure that produce high-Btu bituminous thermal coal that is sold primarily to electric utilities in the eastern United States, our core market. We are a leading producer of high-Btu thermal coal in the Northern Appalachian Basin and the eastern United States due to our ability to efficiently produce and deliver large volumes of high-quality coal at competitive prices, the strategic location of our mines, the industry experience of our management team and our relationship with CONSOL Energy.
The Pennsylvania Mining Complex, which includes the Bailey Mine, the Enlow Fork Mine and the Harvey Mine, has extensive high-quality coal reserves. We mine our reserves from the Pittsburgh No. 8 Coal Seam, which is a large contiguous formation of uniform, high-Btu thermal coal that is ideal for high productivity, low-cost longwall operations. As of December 31, 2016, the Partnership's portion of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex included 191,678 thousand tons of proven and probable coal reserves with an average gross heat content of approximately 12,970 British thermal units ("Btu") per pound and approximately 3.7 pounds sulfur dioxide per million British thermal units ("lb SO2/mmBtu"). Based on our current production capacity, these reserves are sufficient to support approximately 27 years of production. In addition, our reserves currently exhibit thermoplastic behavior suitable for cokemaking and contain an average of approximately 39%-40% volatile matter (on a dry basis), which enables us, if market dynamics are favorable, to capture greater margins from selling our coal as a crossover product in the high-vol metallurgical market to cokemakers and steel manufacturers who utilize modern cokemaking technologies.
The design of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex is optimized to produce large quantities of coal on a cost-efficient basis. We are able to sustain high production volumes at comparatively low operating costs due to, among other things, the technologically advanced longwall mining systems, logistics infrastructure and safety. All of our mines utilize longwall mining, which is a highly automated underground mining technique that produces large volumes of coal at lower costs compared to other underground mining methods. Generally, we operate five longwalls and 15-17 continuous mining sections at the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. The current production capacity of the Partnership's portion of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex’s five longwalls is 7,125 thousand tons of coal per year. The preparation plant is connected via conveyor belts to each of our mines, to clean and process up to 8,200 tons of coal per hour. Our onsite logistics infrastructure at the preparation plant includes a dual-batch train loadout facility capable of loading up to 9,000 tons of coal per hour and 19.3 miles of track linked to separate Class I rail lines owned by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which enables us to simultaneously accommodate multiple unit trains and significantly increases our efficiency in meeting our customers’ transportation needs. Our ability to accommodate multiple unit trains allows for the seamless transition of locomotives from empty inbound trains to fully loaded outbound trains at our facility.
On July 1, 2015, the Partnership’s common units began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CNXC”. On July 7, 2015, the Partnership completed the issuance of common units under the IPO, a private placement with Greenlight Capital, and entered into a $400,000 thousand senior secured revolving credit facility. In connection with the IPO CONSOL Energy contributed a 20% undivided interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses comprising the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. 
On September 30, 2016, the Partnership acquired an additional 5% of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex, from CONSOL Energy and its affiliates, for $21,500 thousand in cash and the issuance of 3,956,496 Class A Preferred Units with a value of $67,300 thousand. All information (except distributable cash flow, which reflects the ownership percentage at the time) included within this filing has been recast to reflect the Partnership's current 25% interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses comprising the Pennsylvania Mining Complex.
Our primary strategy for growing our business and increasing distributions to our unitholders is to make acquisitions that increase our distributable cash flow. The primary component of our growth strategy is based upon our expectation of future divestitures by our sponsor to us of portions of its retained 75% undivided interest in the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. We have a right of first offer pursuant to our omnibus agreement to purchase part or all of the remaining undivided interest in the Pennsylvania Mining Complex retained by our sponsor for so long as our sponsor controls our general partner. CONSOL Energy has stated its desire to divest its retained interest in the Pennsylvania Mining Complex, however the timing and magnitude of such divestitures are dependent upon many market factors.

Our Rights of First Offer
CONSOL Energy granted to us a right of first offer to acquire its retained 75% undivided interest in the Pennsylvania Mining Complex for so long as its affiliates control our general partner. In addition, at December 31, 2016, we also have a right of first offer to acquire two other assets, which will expire in July 2020. CONSOL Energy is under no obligation to sell those assets and we are under no obligation to purchase those assets from CONSOL Energy.
Our Assets
CNX Thermal Holdings, owns a 25% undivided interest in the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. CNX Thermal Holdings entered into an operating agreement with CPCC and Conrhein under which CNX Thermal Holdings is named as operator and assumes management and control over the day-to-day operations of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex for the life of the mines. We are managed by the directors and executive officers of our general partner. As a result, the directors and executive officers of our general partner have the ultimate responsibility for managing and conducting all of our and our subsidiaries’ operations, including with respect to CNX Thermal Holdings’ rights and obligations under the operating agreement. Based on our current production capacity utilizing five longwall mining systems, our recoverable reserves are sufficient to support approximately 27 years of production.
CONSOL Energy owns a 75% undivided interest in the Pennsylvania Mining Complex, as well as 100% of our general partner and, indirectly through our general partner, our 1.7% general partner interest and incentive distribution rights. In addition, CONSOL Energy owns a 60.1% limited partner interest in us. 
Our Operations
Bailey Mine
The Bailey Mine is located in Enon, Pennsylvania. As of December 31, 2016, the Partnership's portion of the Bailey Mine’s assigned and accessible reserve base contained an aggregate of 64,921 thousand tons of clean recoverable proven and probable coal. While operating two longwalls, the typical production capacity of our portion of the Bailey Mine is 2,875 thousand tons (11,500 thousand 100% basis) of coal per year. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our portion of the Bailey Mine produced 3,014 thousand tons, 2,547 thousand tons and 3,081 thousand tons of coal, respectively. 
 Enlow Fork Mine
The Enlow Fork Mine is located directly north of the Bailey Mine. As of December 31, 2016, the Partnership's portion of the Enlow Fork Mine’s assigned and accessible reserve base contained an aggregate of 76,629 thousand tons of clean recoverable proven and probable coal. While operating two longwalls, the typical production capacity of our portion of the Enlow Fork Mine is 2,875 thousand tons (11,500 thousand 100% basis) of coal per year. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our portion of the Enlow Fork Mine produced 2,409 thousand tons, 2,250 thousand tons and 2,639 thousand tons of coal, respectively.
Harvey Mine
The Harvey Mine is located directly east of the Bailey and Enlow Fork Mines. As of December 31, 2016, the Partnership's portion of the Harvey Mine’s assigned and accessible reserve base contained an aggregate of 50,128 thousand tons of clean recoverable proven and probable coal. While operating one longwall, the typical production capacity of our portion of the Harvey Mine is 1,375 thousand tons (5,500 thousand 100% basis) of coal per year. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our portion of the Harvey Mine produced 743 thousand tons, 901 thousand tons and 796 thousand tons of coal, respectively. Longwall production commenced in March 2014.
Coal Capital
In 2017, the Partnership expects to invest $30-$36 million in maintenance capital expenditures. the Partnership is not expecting to invest in expansion projects in 2017, however, the Partnership continually evaluates potential acquisitions.
Our Customers and Contracts
We sell coal to an established customer base through opportunities as a result of strong business relationships or through a formalized bidding process. We refer to the contracts under which coal produced from the Pennsylvania Mining Complex is 
8

sold and which a wholly-owned subsidiary of CONSOL Energy administers under the contract agency agreement at our direction as "our contracts". Our total sold position for 2017 is 6.4 million tons or 98% of the estimated total sales volumes based on the midpoint of our guidance range. In addition to a strong 2017 sold position, we have a solid position of approximately 66% sold for 2018, based on 6.5 million tons of total sales. With our planned coal production in 2017 largely sold out, our focus now has shifted to maximizing realizations for any additional production and booking additional sales for contract years 2018 and 2019. We are currently active in negotiations with several customers to expand our crossover metallurgical coal portfolio, and we continue to pursue select domestic customers that fit with our long-term market strategy.
The sales commitments under contract are our expected sales tons and can fluctuate up or down due to provisions contained within our contracts. The contractual time commitments for customers to nominate future purchase volumes under our contracts are typically sufficient to allow us to balance our sales commitments with prospective production capacity or incremental sales volume. In addition, the commitments can change because of reopener provisions contained in certain of these long-term contracts.  For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 80% and 75%, respectively, of all the coal produced from the Pennsylvania Mining Complex was sold under contracts with terms of one year or more.
The provisions of our contracts are the results of both bidding procedures and extensive negotiations with each customer. As a result, the provisions of our contracts vary significantly in many respects, including, among other factors, price adjustment features, price and contract reopener terms, force majeure provisions, coal qualities and quantities. Our contracts typically stipulate procedures for transportation of coal, quality control, sampling and weighing. Most contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal within stated ranges for specific coal characteristics such as heat, sulfur, ash, moisture, grindability, volatility and other qualities. Failure to meet these specifications can result in economic penalties, rejection or suspension of shipments or termination of the contracts. Although the volume to be delivered pursuant to a long-term contract is stipulated, the customers often have the option to vary the volume within specified limits.
Substantially all of our multi-year sales contracts contain base prices, subject only to pre-established adjustment mechanisms based primarily on (i) variances in the quality characteristics of coal delivered to the customer beyond threshold quality characteristics specified in the applicable sales contract, (ii) the actual calorific value of coal delivered to the customer, and/or (iii) changes in electric power prices in the markets in which our customers operate, as adjusted for any factors set forth in the applicable contract. The electric power price-related adjustments, if any, result only in positive monthly adjustments to the contracted base price that we receive for our coal. Price reopener provisions are present in several of our multi-year sales contracts. These price reopener provisions may automatically set a new price prospectively based on prevailing market price or, in some instances, require the parties to agree on a new price, sometimes within a specified range of prices. In a limited number of agreements, failure of the parties to agree on a price under a price reopener provision can lead to termination of the contract.  Under some of our contracts, we have the right to match lower prices offered to our customers by other suppliers.  Some of the long-term contracts also permit the contract to be reopened for renegotiation of terms and conditions other than pricing terms, and where a mutually acceptable agreement on terms and conditions cannot be concluded, either party may have the option to terminate the contract.
Of our 2016 sales tons, approximately 75% were sold to U.S. electric generators, 22% were priced on export markets and 3% were sold to other domestic customers. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from two customers: Duke Energy Corporation (“Duke Energy”) and GenOn Energy, Inc. (“GenOn Energy”) from each of whom we derived at least 10% of our total coal sales revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately nine sales agreements with these customers that expire at various times between 2017 and 2018.
Transportation Logistics and Infrastructure
We have developed a transportation and logistics network with dual rail transportation options that we believe provides us with operational and marketing flexibility, reduces the cost to deliver coal to our core market and allows us to realize higher netback prices. Most of our coal is sold free on board (“FOB”) at the Pennsylvania Mining Complex, which means that our customers bear the transportation costs from the mining complex, and essentially all of our coal transported to our domestic customers or to an export terminal facility originates by rail. We believe our proximity to our core markets, dual rail transportation options, rail-to-barge access and customized on-site logistics infrastructure contribute to lower overall delivered costs for power plants in the eastern United States as a result of shorter transportation distances, access to diversified rail route options, higher rail car utilization, more efficient use of locomotive power and more predictable movement of product between mine and destination. In addition, we have favorable access to international coal markets through coal export terminals located on the U.S. east coast.

Seasonality
Our business has historically experienced limited variability in its results due to the effect of seasonal changes. Demand for coal-fired power can increase due to unusually hot or cold weather as power consumers use more air conditioning or heating, respectively. Conversely, mild weather can result in weaker demand for our coal. Adverse weather conditions, such as blizzards or floods, can impact our ability to transport coal over our overland conveyor systems and to transport our coal by rail.
Competition
The coal industry is highly competitive, with numerous producers selling into all markets that use coal. There are numerous large and small producers in all coal producing basins of the United States, and we compete with many of these producers. 
The most important factors on which we compete are coal price, coal quality and characteristics, transportation costs and reliability of supply. Demand for coal and the prices that we will be able to obtain for our coal are closely linked to coal consumption patterns of the domestic electric generation industry and foreign coal consumers. These coal consumption patterns are influenced by many factors that are beyond our control, including demand for electricity, which is significantly dependent upon economic activity and summer and winter temperatures in the United States, government regulation, technological developments and the location, quality, price and availability of competing sources of fuel.
Laws and Regulations
Overview
Our coal mining operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety regulations. Regulations relating to our operations require us to obtain permits and other licenses; reclaim and restore our properties after mining operations have been completed; store, transport and dispose of materials used or generated by our operations; manage surface subsidence from underground mining; control water and air emissions; protect wetlands and endangered plant and wildlife; and to ensure employee health and safety. Furthermore, the electric power generation industry is subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities, which could affect demand for our coal. Compliance with these laws has substantially increased the cost of coal mining, and the possibility exists that new legislation
or regulations may be adopted which would have a significant impact on our coal mining operations or our customers’ ability to use our coal and may require us or our customers to change their operations significantly or incur substantial costs.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations to which we and our customers’ business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations and financial position.
Environmental Laws
Air Emissions. The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and corresponding state and local laws and regulations affect all aspects of coal mining operations, both directly and indirectly. The CAA directly impacts our coal mining and processing operations by requiring us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain facilities or to use specific equipment, technologies or best management practices to control emissions.
The CAA also indirectly and more significantly affects the U.S. coal industry by extensively regulating the air emissions of coal-fired electric power generating plants operated by our customers. Coal contains impurities, such as sulfur, mercury and other constituents, many of which are released into the air when coal is burned. Carbon dioxide ("CO2"), a regulated greenhouse gas ("GHG"), is also emitted when coal is burned. Environmental regulations governing emissions from coal-fired electric generating plants increase the costs to operate and could affect demand for coal as a fuel source and affect the volume of our sales. Moreover, additional environmental regulations increase the likelihood that existing coal-fired electric generating plants will be decommissioned, including plants to which the Partnership sells coal to, and reduce the likelihood that new coal-fired plants will be built in the future.
In early 2012, the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") promulgated or finalized several rules for New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS") for coal- and oil- fired power plants which also have a negative effect on coal-generating facilities. The Utility Maximum Control Technology ("UMACT") rule requires more stringent NSPS for particulate matter ("PM"), Sulfur dioxide "SO2") and nitrogen oxides ("NOX") and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards ("MATS") rule 
10

requires new mercury and air toxic standards. In November 2012, the EPA published a notice of reconsideration of certain aspects of the UMACT and MATS rules. Following reconsideration in April 2013 and again in April 2014, the EPA promulgated final UMACT and MATS rules in November 2014 at which point the standards became applicable to new power plants. The final rules have higher emission limits, but the standards are still stringent and compliance with the rules is expensive.
The CAA requires the EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS") for certain pollutants and the CAA identifies two types of NAAQS. Primary standards provide public health protection, including protecting the health of "sensitive" populations such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly. Secondary standards provide public welfare protection, including protection against decreased visibility and damage to animals, crops, vegetation, and buildings. On October 1, 2015, the EPA finalized the NAAQS for ozone pollution and reduced the limit to 70 parts per billion (ppb) from the previous 75 ppb standard. The final rule could have a large impact on both the oil and gas and coal mining industries as states would be required to update their permitting standards to meet these potentially unachievable limits. Six states have now filed a petition for review in the D.C. Circuit of Appeals.
On July 6, 2011, the EPA finalized a rule known as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule ("CSAPR"). CSAPR regulates cross-border emissions of criteria air pollutants such as SO2 and NOX, as well as byproducts, fine particulate matter ("PM2.5") and ozone by requiring states to limit emissions from sources that "contribute significantly" to noncompliance with air quality standards for the criteria air pollutants. If the ambient levels of criteria air pollutants are above the thresholds set by the EPA, a region is considered to be in "nonattainment" for that pollutant and the EPA applies more stringent control standards for sources of air emissions located in the region. In April 2014, the Supreme Court reversed a decision of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals that vacated the rule. Following remand and briefing the D.C. Circuit Court, in October 2014, granted a motion to lift a stay of the rule and allow the EPA to modify the CSAPR compliance deadline by three-years, setting the stage for issuance of the proposed rule. Implementation of CSAPR Phase 1 began in 2015, with Phase 2 scheduled to begin in 2017. On September 7, 2016, the EPA finalized an update to the CSAPR for the 2008 ozone NAAQS by issuing the final CSAPR Update. Starting in May 2017, this rule will reduce summertime (May - September) NOX emissions from power plants in 22 states in the eastern United States. 
On March 27, 2012, the EPA published its proposed NSPS for CO2 emissions from new coal-powered electric generating units. The proposed rule would have applied to new power plants and to existing plants that make major modifications. If the rule had been adopted as proposed, only new coal-fired power plants with CO2 capture and storage ("CCS") could have met the proposed emission limits. Commercial scale CCS is not likely to be available in the near future, and if available, it may make coal-fired electric generation units uneconomical compared to new gas-fired electric generation units. On January 8, 2014, the EPA re-proposed NSPS for CO2 for new fossil fuel fired power plants and rescinded the rules that were proposed on April 12, 2012.
On September 20, 2013, the EPA issued a new proposal to control carbon emissions from new power plants. Under the Clean Power Plan ("CPP") proposal, the EPA would establish separate NSPS for CO2 emissions for natural gas-fired turbines and coal-fired units. The proposed “Carbon Pollution Standard for New Power Plants” replaces the earlier proposal released by the EPA in 2012. On August 3, 2015, the EPA finalized the Carbon Pollution Standards to cut carbon emissions from new, modified and reconstructed power plants, which would have become effective on October 23, 2015. On June 2, 2014, the EPA proposed additional CPP legislation to cut carbon emissions from existing power plants. Under this proposed rule, the EPA would create emission guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to address GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. Specifically, the EPA is proposing state-specific rate-based goals for CO2 emissions from the power sector, as well as guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to achieve the state-specific goals. On August 3, 2015, the EPA finalized the CPP Rule to cut carbon pollution from existing power plants, which would have become effective on December 22, 2015. 
States, industry, organizations, and private entities have filed multiple petitions for review of the CPP in the D.C. Circuit of Appeals and requested that the Court stay implementation of the CPP because they will suffer “irreparable harm.” Petitioners also argued that the Final Rule violates the CAA because energy generating units are already subject to hazardous air pollutant limits under Section 112 of the CAA. On November 3, 2015, twenty-three states were involved in filing a Petition for Review in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., challenging EPA’s Section 111(b) Rule-also called the “NSPS”-which regulates new coal-fired power plants. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay, halting implementation of the EPA’s CPP pending the resolution of legal challenges to the program in court. 
Clean Water Act. The federal Clean Water Act ("CWA") and corresponding state laws affect our coal operations by regulating discharges into surface waters. Permits requiring regular monitoring and compliance with effluent limitations and reporting requirements govern the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters. The CWA and corresponding state laws include 
11

requirements for: improvement of designated "impaired waters" (i.e., not meeting state water quality standards) through the use of effluent limitations; anti-degradation regulations which protect state designated "high quality/exceptional use" streams by restricting or prohibiting discharges; requirements to treat discharges from coal mining properties for non-traditional pollutants, such as chlorides, selenium and dissolved solids; requirements to minimize impacts and compensate for unavoidable impacts resulting from discharges of fill materials to regulated streams and wetlands; and requirements to dispose of produced wastes and other oil and gas wastes at approved disposal facilities. In addition, the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure ("SPCC") requirements of the CWA apply to all CONSOL Energy operations that use or produce fluids and require the implementation of plans to address any spills and the installation of secondary containment around all storage tanks. These requirements may cause us to incur significant additional costs that could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
However, on June 29, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule effective August 28, 2015, clarifying which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act, which would impose additional permitting obligations on our operations. On August 27, 2015, the District Court for the District of North Dakota blocked implementation of the rule in 13 states. On October 9, 2015, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit blocked implementation of the rule nationwide. On January 19, 2017 the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider whether jurisdiction rests with the federal district or appellate courts to decide this matter. 
In order to obtain a permit for surface coal mining activities, including valley fills associated with steep slope mining, an operator must obtain a permit for the discharge of fill material from the ACOE and a discharge permit from the state regulatory authority under the state counterpart to the CWA. Beginning in early 2009, the EPA took a number of initiatives that have resulted in delays and obstruction of the issuance of such permits for surface mining operations in the Appalachian states, including Pennsylvania where the Pennsylvania Mining Complex is located. Increased oversight of delegated state programmatic authority, coupled with individual permit review and additional requirements imposed by the EPA, has resulted in delays in the review and issuance of permits for surface coal mining operations, including applications for surface facilities for underground mines, such as applications for coal refuse disposal areas.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and corresponding state laws and regulations affect coal mining by imposing requirements for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. Facilities at which hazardous wastes have been treated, stored or disposed of are subject to corrective action orders issued by the EPA that could adversely affect our results, financial condition and cash flows. In 2010, the EPA proposed options for the regulation of Coal Combustion Residuals ("CCRs") from the electric power sector as either hazardous waste or non-hazardous waste. On December 19, 2014, the EPA announced the first national regulations for the disposal of CCRs from electric utilities and independent power producers under RCRA. On April 17, 2015, the EPA finalized these regulations under the solid waste provisions (Subtitle D) of RCRA and not the hazardous waste provisions (Subtitle C) which became effective on October 19, 2015. The EPA affirms in the preamble to the final rule that “this rule does not apply to CCR placed in active or abandoned underground or surface mines.” Instead, “the U.S. Department of Interior ("DOI") and the EPA will address the management of CCR in mine fills in a separate regulatory action(s).” On November 3, 2015, the EPA published the final rule Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards ("ELG"), revising the regulations for the Steam Electric Power Generating category which became effective on January 4, 2016. The rule sets the first federal limits on the levels of toxic metals in wastewater that can be discharged from power plants, based on technology improvements in the steam electric power industry over the last three decades. The combined effect of the CCR and ELG regulations has forced power generating companies to close existing ash ponds and will likely force the closure of certain older existing coal burning power plants that cannot comply with the new standards.
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. The federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act ("SMCRA") establishes minimum national operational and reclamation standards for all surface mines as well as most aspects of underground mines. SMCRA requires that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of and following completion of mining activities. Permits for all mining operations must be obtained from the U.S. Office of Surface Mining ("OSM") or, where state regulatory agencies have adopted federally approved state programs under SMCRA, the appropriate state regulatory authority. States that operate federally approved state programs may impose standards which are more stringent than the requirements of SMCRA and OSM's regulations and in many instances have done so. The Pennsylvania Mining Complex is located in states which have achieved primary jurisdiction for enforcement of SMCRA through approved state programs. In addition, SMCRA imposes a reclamation fee on all current mining operations, the proceeds of which are deposited in the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, which is used to restore unreclaimed and abandoned mine lands mined before 1977. The current per ton fee is $0.28 per ton for surface mined coal and $0.12 per ton for underground mined coal. These fees are currently scheduled to be in effect until September 30, 2021.
12

Federal and state laws require bonds to secure our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations. These bonds are provided by CONSOL Energy and are typically renewable on a yearly basis. Surety bond costs have increased while the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable. It is possible that surety-bond issuers may refuse to renew bonds or may demand additional collateral. Any failure by CONSOL Energy or us to maintain, or our inability to acquire, surety bonds that are required by state and federal laws would have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce coal, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.
Excess Spoil, Coal Mine Waste, Diversions, and Buffer Zones for Perennial and Intermittent Streams. The OSM has issued final amendments to regulations concerning stream buffer zones, stream channel diversions, excess spoil, and coal mine waste to comply with an order issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 20, 2014, which vacated the stream buffer zone rule that was published December 12, 2008. On July 27, 2015, OSM published the proposed Stream Protection Rule ("SPR"). After much debate and thousands of comments, the final SPR was published by OSM in the Federal Register on December 20, 2016. The final SPR requires the restoration of the physical form, hydrologic function, and ecological function of the segment of a perennial or intermittent stream that a permittee mines through. Additionally, it requires that the post-mining surface configuration of the reclaimed mine site include a drainage pattern, including ephemeral streams, similar to the pre-mining drainage pattern, with exceptions for stability, topographical changes, fish and wildlife habitat, etc. The rule also, requires the establishment of a 100-foot-wide streamside vegetative corridor of native species (including riparian species, when appropriate) along each bank of any restored or permanently-diverted perennial, intermittent, or ephemeral stream. The congressional majority have vowed to block the SPR through a Congressional Review Act resolution. The Congressional Review Act is a law that allows Congress to overturn rules issued by federal agencies. Once a rule is finalized, Congress has a limited period of time to pass a joint resolution of disapproval preventing it from taking effect. The president-elect has also vowed to overturn the SPR. It remains to be seen if the SPR will be enforced. Many believe the SPR to be an overreach of jurisdiction by the OSM, particularly into areas under the legal jurisdiction of other federal agencies, particularly the EPA, the Corps of Engineers, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as delegated state programs or state laws (e.g., Clean Water Act authority, PA Clean Streams Law, etc.).
Health and Safety Laws
Mine Safety. Legislative and regulatory changes have required us to purchase additional safety equipment, construct stronger seals to isolate mined out areas, and engage in additional training. We have also experienced more aggressive inspection protocols, and with new regulations the volume of civil penalties have increased. The actions taken thus far by federal and state governments include requiring:

• | the caching of additional supplies of self-contained self-rescuer ("SCSR") devices underground;


• | the purchase and installation of electronic communication and personal tracking devices underground;


• | the purchase and installation of proximity detection devices on continuous miner machines;


• | the placement of refuge chambers, which are structures designed to provide refuge for groups of miners during a mine emergency when evacuation from the mine is not possible, which will provide breathable air for 96 hours;


• | the purchase of new fire resistant conveyor belting underground;


• | additional training and testing that creates the need to hire additional employees;


• | more stringent rock dusting requirements; and


• | the purchase of personal dust monitors for collecting respirable dust samples from certain miners.

On October 2, 2015, the Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA") published proposed rules for underground coal mining operations concerning proximity detection systems for coal hauling machines and scoops. The rulemaking record for this proposed rule was closed on December 15, 2016, but on January 9, 2017, MSHA published a notice reopening the record and extending the comment period for this proposed rule for 30 days. On January 15, 2015, MSHA published a final rule requiring underground coal mine operations to equip continuous mining machines, except full-face continuous mining machines, with proximity detection systems. The proximity detection system strengthens protection for miners by reducing the potential of pinning, crushing and striking hazards that result in accidents involving life-threatening injuries and death. The final rule became effective March 15, 2015 and included a phased in schedule for newly manufactured and in-service equipment. 
In 2010, MSHA rolled out the “End Black Lung, Act Now” initiative. As a result, MSHA implemented a new final rule on August 1, 2014 to lower miners’ exposure to respirable coal mine dust including using the new Personal Dust Monitor technology. This final rule was implemented in three phases. The first phase began on August 1, 2014 and utilized the current gravimetric sampling device to take full shift dust samples from the current designated occupations and areas. It also required additional record keeping and immediate corrective action in the event of overexposure. The second phase began on February 1, 2016 and required additional sampling for designated and other occupations using the new continuous personal dust monitor

("CPDM") technology, which provides real time dust exposure information to the miner. CPDM equipment was purchased and was placed into service which was required to meet compliance with the new rule. Dust Coordinators and Dust Technicians were hired in order to meet the staffing demand to manage compliance with the new rule. The final phase of the rule went into effect on August 1, 2016. The current respirable dust standard was reduced from 2.0 to 1.5mg/m3 for designated occupations and from 1.0 to 0.5mg/m3 for Part 90 Miners.
Black Lung Legislation. Under federal black lung benefits legislation, each coal mine operator is required to make payments of black lung benefits or contributions to: 

• | current and former coal miners totally disabled from black lung disease;


• | certain survivors of miners who have died from black lung disease; and


• | a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants whose last mine employment was before January 1, 1970, where no responsible coal mine operator has been identified for claims (where a miner's last coal employment was after December 31, 1969), or where the responsible coal mine operator has defaulted on the payment of such benefits. The trust fund is funded by an excise tax on U.S. production of up to $1.10 per ton for deep mined coal and up to $0.55 per ton for surface-mined coal, neither amount to exceed 4.4% of the gross sales price.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("PPACA") made two changes to the Federal Black Lung Benefits Act. First, it provided changes to the legal criteria used to assess and award claims by creating a legal presumption that miners are entitled to benefits if they have worked at least 15 years in underground coal mines, or in similar conditions, and suffer from a totally disabling lung disease. To rebut this presumption, a coal company would have to prove that a miner did not have black lung or that the disease was not caused by the miner's work. Second, it changed the law so black lung benefits will continue to be paid to dependent survivors when the miner passes away, regardless of the cause of the miner's death. The changes have increased the cost to us of complying with the Federal Black Lung Benefits Act. In addition to the federal legislation, we are also liable under various state statutes for our portion of black lung claims.
Employees
Neither we nor our subsidiaries have any employees. Our general partner has the sole responsibility for providing the employees and other personnel necessary to conduct our operations. The directors and executive officers of our general partner manage our and our subsidiaries’ operations and activities. The executive officers of our general partner are employed and compensated by CONSOL Energy or its affiliates, other than the general partner. Under our omnibus agreement with CONSOL Energy, we reimburse CONSOL Energy for compensation-related expenses (including salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other amounts) attributable to the portion of an executive’s compensation that is allocable to our general partner. Pursuant to the operating agreement with CONSOL Energy, CNX Thermal Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary, manages and controls the day-to-day operations of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. Under our employee services agreement with CONSOL Energy, CONSOL Energy employees continue to mine, process and market coal from the Pennsylvania Mining Complex, subject to our direction and control under the operating agreement. All of the field-level employees required to conduct and support our operations are employed by CONSOL Energy or its subsidiaries and are subject to the employee services agreement that we entered into with CONSOL Energy. As of December 31, 2016, CONSOL Energy employed approximately 1,600 people who provide direct support to our operations pursuant to the employee services agreement. None of the employees who provide direct support to our operations are represented by a labor union or collective bargaining agreement. 
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act ("JOBS Act")
Under the JOBS Act, for as long as the Partnership remains an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from the SEC's reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to provide an auditor’s attestation report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of its system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and seeking unitholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company.
The Partnership will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if:

• | we have more than $1 billion of revenues in a fiscal year;


• | limited partner interests held by non-affiliates have a market value of more than $700 million (large accelerated filer); or

14


• | we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.

The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Partnership has irrevocably elected to “opt out” of this exemption and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
