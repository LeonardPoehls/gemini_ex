Item 1. Business.
GENERAL
 
Santa Fe Financial Corporation (“Santa Fe” or the “Company”) and may also be referred to as “we” “us” or “our” in this report) was incorporated under the name of Tri Financial Corporation in the State of Nevada on July 25, 1967 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Crateo, Inc., a public company. On October 31, 1969, Crateo issued a one-for-one stock dividend of all of its shares of Tri Financial to its common shareholders. On September 17, 1970, the name of the Corporation was changed to Santa Fe Financial Corporation.
 
As of June 30, 2017, approximately 81.9% of the outstanding common stock of Santa Fe was owned by The InterGroup Corporation (“InterGroup”), a public company (NASDAQ: INTG). As of June 30, 2017, Santa Fe owned approximately 68.8% of the common stock of Portsmouth Square, Inc. (“Portsmouth”), a public company (OTCBB: PRSI). InterGroup also directly owns approximately 13.4% of the common stock of Portsmouth.
 
The Company’s principal source of operating revenue has been, and continues to be, derived from the management of its 68.8% owned subsidiary, Portsmouth. Portsmouth’s primary business is conducted through its general and limited partnership interest in Justice. Portsmouth controls approximately 93.1% of the voting interest in Justice and is the sole general partner of Justice. The financial statements of Justice are consolidated with those of the Company. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
 
Justice, through its subsidiaries Justice Holdings Company, LLC (“Holdings”), a Delaware Limited Liability Company, Justice Operating Company, LLC (“Operating”), Justice Mezzanine Company, LLC (“Mezzanine”) and Kearny Street Parking, LLC (“Parking”) owns a 543-room hotel property located at 750 Kearny Street, San Francisco California, known as the Hilton San Francisco Financial District (the “Hotel”) and related facilities including a five level underground parking garage. Holdings, Mezzanine, and Parking are all wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Partnership; Operating is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mezzanine. Mezzanine is the borrower under certain mezzanine indebtedness of Justice, and in December 2013, the Partnership conveyed ownership of the Hotel to Operating. The Hotel is operated by the partnership as a full service Hilton brand hotel pursuant to a Franchise License Agreement with HLT Franchise Holding LLC (Hilton). Justice had a management agreement with Prism Hospitality L.P. (“Prism”) to perform certain management functions for the Hotel. The management agreement with Prism had an original term of ten years, subject to the Partnership’s right to terminate at any time with or without cause. Effective January 2014, the management agreement with Prism was amended by the Partnership to change the nature of the services provided by Prism and the compensation payable to Prism, among other things. Prism’s management agreement was terminated upon its expiration date of February 3, 2017. Effective December 1, 2013, GMP Management, Inc. (“GMP”), a company owned by a Justice limited partner and a related party, also provided management services for the Partnership pursuant to a management services agreement, with a three year term, subject to the Partnership’s right to terminate earlier for cause. In June 2016, GMP resigned. After a lengthy review process of several national third party hotel management companies, on February 1, 2017, Justice entered into a Hotel management agreement (“HMA”) with Interstate Management Company, LLC (“Interstate”) to manage the Hotel with an effective takeover date of February 3, 2017. The term of the management agreement is for an initial period of ten years commencing on the takeover date and automatically renews for an additional year not to exceed five years in the aggregate subject to certain conditions.
 
The parking garage that is part of the Hotel property was managed by Ace Parking pursuant to a contract with the Partnership. The contract was terminated with an effective termination date of October 4, 2016. The Company began managing the parking garage in-house after the termination of Ace Parking. Effective February 3, 2017, Interstate took over the management of the parking garage along with the Hotel.
 
The Company also derives rental income from two multi-family, residential rental properties located in the Los Angeles area. The Company may also look for new real estate investment opportunities in hotels, apartments, office buildings and shopping centers. The acquisition of any new real estate investments will depend on the Company’s ability to find suitable investment opportunities and the availability of sufficient financing to acquire such investments. To help fund any such acquisition, the Company may borrow funds to leverage its investment capital. The amount of any such debt will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the availability of financing and the sufficiency of the acquisition property’s projected cash flows to support the operations and debt service.

The Company also derives income from the investment of its cash and investment securities assets. The Company has invested in income-producing instruments, equity and debt securities and will consider other investments if such investments offer growth or profit potential. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the Company’s marketable securities and other investments.
 
HILTON HOTELS FRANCHISE LICENSE AGREEMENT
 
The Partnership entered into a Franchise License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with the HLT Existing Franchise Holding LLC (Hilton) on November 24, 2004. The term of the License Agreement was for an initial period of fifteen years commencing on the date the Hotel began operating as a Hilton hotel, with an option to extend the License Agreement for another five years, subject to certain conditions. On June 26, 2015, Operating and Hilton entered into an amended franchise agreement that, among other things, extended the License Agreement through 2030, and also provided the Partnership with certain key money cash incentives to be earned through 2030.
HOTEL MANAGEMENT COMPANY AGREEMENT
 
On February 2, 2007, the Partnership entered into a management agreement with Prism to manage and operate the Hotel as its agent. The original management agreement was effective for a term of ten years, but was amended in January 2014. Effective January 2014, the required base management fees were amended to a fixed rate of $20,000 per month. Under the amended management agreement, Prism can also earn an incentive fee of $11,000 for each month that the revenues per room of the Hotel exceeds the average revenues per room of a defined set of competing hotels. Base management fees and incentives paid to Prism during the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 were $120,000 and $251,000, respectively.
 
Effective December 1, 2013, GMP Management, Inc. (“GMP”), a company owned by a Justice limited partner and related party, began to provide management services for the Partnership pursuant to a management services agreement. The management agreement with GMP had a term of three years, subject to the Partnership’s right to terminate earlier, for cause. In June 2016, GMP resigned. Under the agreement, GMP was required to advise the Partnership on the management and operation of the hotel; administer the Partnership’s contracts, leases, agreements with hotel managers and franchisors and other contracts and agreements; provide administrative and asset management services, oversee financial reporting, and maintain offices at the Hotel in order to facilitate provision of services. GMP was paid an annual base management fee of $325,000 per year, increasing by 5% per year, payable in monthly installments, and was eligible for reimbursement for reasonable and necessary costs and expenses incurred by GMP in performing its obligations under the agreement.
 
During the year ended June 30, 2016, GMP was paid $1,637,000 for the salaries, benefits, and local payroll taxes for GMP employees and various other reimbursable expenses. Also included in the $1,637,000 is the $200,000 fee paid to GMP for the completion of the reorganization of the Partnership and the related financing transactions.
 Total GMP base management fees and reimbursed GMP employee costs expensed during the year ended June 30, 2016 were $1,219,000 and are included in the consolidated statements of operations. GMP resigned in June 2016 and there were no fees paid to GMP during fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.
 
After a lengthy review process of several national third party hotel management companies, on February 1, 2017, Justice entered into a Hotel management agreement with Interstate Management Company, LLC to manage the Hotel with an effective takeover date of February 3, 2017. The term of the management agreement is for an initial period of ten years commencing on the takeover date and automatically renews for an additional year not to exceed five years in the aggregate subject to certain conditions.
 
GARAGE OPERATIONS
 
On October 31, 2010, the Partnership and Ace Parking entered into an amendment of their original parking agreement to extend the term for a period of sixty two (62) months, commencing on November 1, 2010 and terminating on December 31, 2015, subject to either party’s right to terminate the agreement without cause on ninety (90) days’ written notice. The monthly management fee of $2,000 and the accounting fee of $250 remained the same, but the amendment modified how the “Excess Profit Fee” (as described below) to be paid to Ace Parking would be calculated. The parking agreement with Ace Parking was terminated with an effective termination date of October 4, 2016. The Company began managing the parking garage in-house after the termination of Ace Parking. As part of the Hotel management agreement, Interstate, through the Partnership’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Kearny Street Parking LLC, began managing the parking garage in-house effective February 3, 2017.

The amendment noted above provided that, if net operating income (“NOI”) from the garage operations exceeded $1,800,000 but was less than $2,000,000, then Ace Parking would be entitled to a fee (the “Excess Profit Fee”) of one percent (1%) of the total annual NOI. If the annual NOI was $2,000,000 or higher, Ace Parking would be entitled to an Excess Profit Fee equal to two percent (2%) of the total annual NOI. The garage’s NOI did not exceed the annual NOI of $1,800,000 for the years ended June 30, 2017 or 2016. Base management and incentive fees to Ace Parking amounted to $39,000 and $24,000 for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
CHINESE CULTURE FOUNDATION LEASE
 
On March 15, 2005, the Partnership entered into an amended lease with the Chinese Culture Foundation of San Francisco (the “Foundation”) for the third floor space of the Hotel commonly known as the Chinese Culture Center, which the Foundation had right to occupy pursuant to a 50-year nominal rent lease that began in 1967.
 
The amended lease, among other things, requires the Partnership to pay to the Foundation a monthly event space fee in the amount of $5,000, adjusted annually based on the local Consumer Price Index. The term of the amended lease expires on October 17, 2023, with an automatic extension for another 10 year term if the property continues to be operated as a hotel.
 
MARKETABLE SECURITIES INVESTMENT POLICIES
 
In addition to its Hotel and real estate operations, the Company also invests from time to time in income producing instruments, corporate debt and equity securities, publicly traded investment funds, mortgage backed securities, securities issued by REIT’s and other companies which invest primarily in real estate.
 
The Company’s securities investments are made under the supervision of a Securities Investment Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”). The Committee currently has three members and is chaired by the Company’s Chairman of the Board and President, John V. Winfield. The Committee has delegated authority to manage the portfolio to the Company’s Chairman and President together with such assistants and management committees he may engage. The Committee generally follows certain established investment guidelines for the Company’s investments. These guidelines presently include: (i) corporate equity securities should be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NYSE MKT, NYSE Arca or the Nasdaq Stock Market (NASDAQ); (ii) the issuer of the listed securities should be in compliance with the listing standards of the applicable national securities exchange; and (iii) investment in a particular issuer should not exceed 10% of the market value of the total portfolio. The investment guidelines do not require the Company to divest itself of investments, which initially meet these guidelines but subsequently fail to meet one or more of the investment criteria. The Committee has in the past approved non-conforming investments and may in the future approve non-conforming investments. The Committee may modify these guidelines from time to time.
 
The Company may also invest, with the approval of the Committee, in unlisted securities, such as convertible notes, through private placements including private equity investment funds. Those investments in non-marketable securities are carried at cost on the Company’s balance sheet as part of other investments and reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis. As of June 30, 2017, the Company had other investments of $696,000.
 
As part of its investment strategies, the Company may assume short positions in marketable securities. Short sales are used by the Company to potentially offset normal market risks undertaken in the course of its investing activities or to provide additional return opportunities. As of June 30, 2017, the Company had obligations for securities sold of $1,271,000 (equities short).
 
In addition, the Company may utilize margin for its marketable securities purchases through the use of standard margin agreements with national brokerage firms. The margin used by the Company may fluctuate depending on market conditions. The use of leverage could be viewed as risky and the market values of the portfolio may be subject to large fluctuations.

As Chairman of the Committee, the Company’s Chairman and President, John V. Winfield, directs the investment activity of the Company in public and private markets pursuant to authority granted by the Board of Directors. Mr. Winfield also serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Portsmouth and InterGroup and oversees the investment activity of those companies. Depending on certain market conditions and various risk factors, the Chief Executive Officer, Portsmouth and InterGroup may, at times, invest in the same companies in which the Company invests. Such investments align the interests of the Company with the interests of these related parties because it places the personal resources of the Chief Executive Officer and the resources of Portsmouth and InterGroup, at risk in substantially the same manner as the Company in connection with investment decisions made on behalf of the Company.
 
Further information with respect to investment in marketable securities and other investments of the Company is set forth in Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section and Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Seasonality
 
Hotel’s operations historically have been seasonal. Like most hotels in the San Francisco area, the Hotel generally maintains higher occupancy and room rates during the first and second quarters of its fiscal year (July 1 through December 31) than it does in the third and fourth quarters (January 1 through June 30). These seasonal patterns can be expected to cause fluctuations in the quarterly revenues from the Hotel.
Competition 
 
The hotel industry is highly competitive. Competition is based on a number of factors, most notably convenience of location, brand affiliation, price, range of services and guest amenities or accommodations offered and quality of customer service. Competition is often specific to the individual market in which properties are located. The San Francisco market is a very competitive market with a high supply of guest rooms and meeting space in the area. During fiscal 2017, we began the work with Hilton approved providers to overhaul all technical aspects of the Hotel whereby when completed, we expect to have an edge over our competitors by implementing advanced state of the art systems which we anticipate a complete implementation during fiscal 2018. Specifically the complete overhaul of the infrastructure of the Internet in both the guest rooms and meeting space will position the hotel above any of our competitors in this market or any other. This investment will allow the hotel to go to market with specific measurable statistics that will help win the much coveted technology company meetings. Our short-term plans also include the relocation of the restaurant and bar to the front of the Hotel which would provide visibility from Kearny and Washington Streets and therefore, attract additional traffic as well as put us in line with our two closest competitors that have street view outlets. In fiscal 2016, the Hotel replaced the carpet flooring in the lobby and the fourth floor with oak wood, creating an open and welcoming environment that completely transformed the sense of arrival for guests. The Hotel also modernized the furniture in the lobby, the porte cochere, and the second floor; and replaced the third floor carpets and doors. The fitness center was expanded to twice the size to eliminate one of our top guest complaints while upgrading the space with state of the art equipment.
 
The Hotel’s highest priority is guest satisfaction. Enhancing the guest experience differentiates the Hotel from its competition and is critical to the Hotel’s objective of building sustainable guest loyalty. In addition to the recent completion of “The Cloud” (a technology lounge), three new premium executive meeting rooms and the Karaoke lounge, the Hotel has enhanced the arrival experience of the guests by renovating and upgrading the entrance and the lobby. Meeting planner scores reflect the increased focus on taking care of guests increasing in our scores 6.2 points year over year in likelihood to return to property.

The Hotel is focusing on high-end clients with more banquets and meeting room requirements. Moving forward, the Hotel will continue to focus on cultivating international business, especially from China, and capturing a greater percentage of the higher rated business, leisure and group travel. We believe that our Hotel’s location in the San Francisco Financial District lends itself to greater opportunities than our competitors when it comes to developing relationships with the financial district entities and will focus on establishing a greater client base. The Hotel will also continue in our efforts to expand guest rooms and facilities and explore new and innovative ways to differentiate the Hotel from its competition, as well as focusing on enhancing the Hotel’s technology infrastructure. The hotel will capitalize on the increased hotel occupancy, rates and overall hotel property value upon completion of the Moscone Center expansion and improvement project which is scheduled to be completed in December of 2018. However, like all hotels, the Hotel will remain subject to the uncertain domestic and global economic environment and other risk factors beyond our control, such as the effect of natural disasters and economic uncertainties.
 
The Hotel is also subject to certain operating risks common to all of the hotel industry, which could adversely impact performance. These risks include:
 

· | Competition for guests and meetings from other hotels including competition and pricing pressure from internet wholesalers and distributors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | increases in operating costs, including wages, benefits, insurance, property taxes and energy, due to inflation and other factors, which may not be offset in the future by increased room rates;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | labor strikes, disruptions or lock outs;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | dependence on demand from business and leisure travelers, which may fluctuate and is seasonal;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | increases in energy costs, cost of fuel, airline fares and other expenses related to travel, which may negatively affect traveling;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | terrorism, terrorism alerts and warnings, wars and other military actions, pandemics or other medical events or warnings which may result in decreases in business and leisure travel;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | natural disasters; and
--+-----------------------


· | adverse effects of downturns and recessionary conditions in international, national and/or local economies and market conditions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environmental Matters 
 
In connection with the ownership of the Hotel, the Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under these laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances.
 
Environmental consultants retained by the Partnership or its lenders conducted updated Phase I environmental site assessments in fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 on the Hotel property. These Phase I assessments relied, in part, on Phase I environmental assessments prepared in connection with the Partnership’s first mortgage loan obtained in December 2013. Phase I assessments are designed to evaluate the potential for environmental contamination on properties based generally upon site inspections, facility personnel interviews, historical information and certain publicly-available databases; however, Phase I assessments will not necessarily reveal the existence or extent of all environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns at the properties.
 
Although the Phase I assessments and other environmental reports we have reviewed disclose certain conditions on our properties and the use of hazardous substances in operation and maintenance activities that could pose a risk of environmental contamination or liability, we are not aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The Company believes that the Hotel is in compliance, in all material respects, with all federal, state and local environmental ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters, the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company has not received written notice from any governmental authority of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of its present properties.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
As of June 30, 2017, the Company had two full-time employees. The employees of the Company are not part of any collective bargaining agreement, and the Company believes that its employee relations are satisfactory.
 
Effective February 3, 2017, the Partnership had no employees. On February 3, 2017, Interstate assumed all labor union agreements and retained employees of their choice to continue providing services to the Hotel. As of June 30, 2017, approximately 83% of those employees were represented by one of three labor unions, and their terms of employment were determined under a collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) to which the Partnership was a party. During the year ended June 30, 2014, the Partnership renewed the CBAs for the Local 2 (Hotel and Restaurant Employees), Local 856 (International Brotherhood of Teamsters), and Local 39 (stationary engineers). The present CBAs expire in July 2018 and labor union negotiations are scheduled to commence during the 4th calendar quarter of 2017.
 
Negotiation of collective bargaining agreements, which includes not just terms and conditions of employment, but scope and coverage of employees, is a regular and expected course of business operations for the Partnership. The Partnership expects and anticipates that the terms of conditions of CBAs will have an impact on wage and benefit costs, operating expenses, and certain hotel operations during the life of the each CBA, and incorporates these principles into its operating and budgetary practices.
