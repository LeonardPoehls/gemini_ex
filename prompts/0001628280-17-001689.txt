Item 1. | Business.

General
Noble Corporation plc, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (“Noble-UK”), is a leading offshore drilling contractor for the oil and gas industry. We perform contract drilling services with our global fleet of mobile offshore drilling units. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our fleet of 28 drilling rigs consisted of 14 jackups, eight drillships and six semisubmersibles.
For additional information on the specifications of our fleet, see Part I, Item 2, “Properties—Drilling Fleet.” At December 31, 2016, our fleet was located in the United States, the North Sea, South Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Noble and its predecessors have been engaged in the contract drilling of oil and gas wells since 1921.
Spin-off of Paragon Offshore plc (“Paragon Offshore”)
On August 1, 2014, Noble-UK completed the separation and spin-off of a majority of its standard specification offshore drilling business (the “Spin-off”) through a pro rata distribution of all of the ordinary shares of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Paragon Offshore, to the holders of Noble’s ordinary shares. Our shareholders received one share of Paragon Offshore for every three shares of Noble owned as of July 23, 2014, the record date for the distribution. Through the Spin-off, we disposed of most of our standard specification drilling units and related assets, liabilities and business. Prior to the Spin-off, Paragon Offshore issued approximately $1.7 billion of long-term debt. We used the proceeds from this debt to repay certain amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. The results of operations for Paragon Offshore prior to the Spin-off date and incremental Spin-off related costs have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
For additional information regarding the Spin-off and our current relationship with Paragon Offshore, see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2—Spin-off of Paragon Offshore plc ("Paragon Offshore")” and Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 17—Commitments and Contingencies.”
Consummation of Merger and Redomiciliation
On November 20, 2013, pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated as of June 30, 2013 between Noble Corporation, a Swiss corporation (“Noble-Swiss”), and Noble-UK, Noble-Swiss merged with and into Noble-UK, with Noble-UK as the surviving company (the “Transaction”). In the Transaction, all of the outstanding ordinary shares of Noble-Swiss were cancelled, and Noble-UK issued, through an exchange agent, one ordinary share of Noble-UK in exchange for each ordinary share of Noble-Swiss. The Transaction effectively changed the place of incorporation of our publicly traded parent holding company from Switzerland to the United Kingdom.
Noble Corporation, a Cayman Islands company (“Noble-Cayman”), is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Noble-UK, our publicly-traded parent company. Noble-UK’s principal asset is all of the shares of Noble-Cayman. Noble-Cayman has no public equity outstanding. The consolidated financial statements of Noble-UK include the accounts of Noble-Cayman, and Noble-UK conducts substantially all of its business through Noble-Cayman and its subsidiaries.
Business Strategy
Our goal is to be the preferred offshore drilling contractor for the oil and gas industry based upon the following core principles:

• | operate in a manner that provides a safe working environment for our employees while protecting the environment and our assets;


• | provide an attractive investment vehicle; and


• | deliver superior customer service through a diverse and technically advanced fleet operated by proficient crews.

Our business strategy focuses on a balanced fleet of both deepwater and high-specification jackup assets and the deployment of our drilling rigs in important oil and gas basins around the world.
Over the past five years, we have expanded our drilling and fleet through our newbuild program. We took delivery of our remaining newbuild, the heavy-duty, harsh environment jackup, Noble Lloyd Noble, in July 2016. The Noble Lloyd Noble commenced operations in November 2016 under a four-year contract in the North Sea. Although we plan to focus on capital preservation and liquidity based on current market conditions, we also continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance our fleet, particularly focusing on higher specification rigs, to execute the increasingly complex drilling programs required of our customers.

Demand for our services is, in significant part, a function of the worldwide demand for oil and gas and the global supply of mobile offshore drilling units. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of jackups and ultra-deepwater drilling units. Brent crude has declined from approximately $112 per barrel on June 30, 2014 to as low as approximately $30 per barrel in January 2016, before improving to $56 per barrel on February 15, 2017.  As a result, our customers have greatly reduced their exploration and development spending and the number of rigs they have under contract. This combination of increased supply of drilling rigs and reduced demand for such rigs has resulted in falling dayrates and significantly reduced opportunities to re-contract our rigs upon expiry of existing contracts. 
Drilling Contracts
We typically employ each drilling unit under an individual contract. Although the final terms of the contracts result from negotiations with our customers, many contracts are awarded based upon a competitive bidding process. Our drilling contracts generally contain the following terms:

• | contract duration extending over a specific period of time or a period necessary to drill a defined number wells;


• | payment of compensation to us (generally in U.S. Dollars although some customers, typically national oil companies, require a part of the compensation to be paid in local currency) on a “daywork” basis, so that we receive a fixed amount for each day (“dayrate”) that the drilling unit is operating under contract (a lower rate or no compensation is payable during periods of equipment breakdown and repair or adverse weather or in the event operations are interrupted by other conditions, some of which may be beyond our control);


• | provisions permitting early termination of the contract by the customer (i) if the unit is lost or destroyed or (ii) if operations are suspended for a specified period of time due to breakdown of equipment or breach of contract;


• | provisions allowing the impacted party to terminate the contract if specified “force majeure” events beyond the contracting parties’ control occur for a defined period of time;


• | payment by us of the operating expenses of the drilling unit, including labor costs and the cost of incidental supplies;


• | provisions that allow us to recover certain cost increases from our customers in certain long-term contracts; and


• | provisions that require us to lower dayrates for documented cost decreases in certain long-term contracts.

The terms of some of our drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract after specified notice periods by tendering contractually specified termination amounts and, in certain cases, without any payment.
Generally, our contracts allow us to recover our mobilization and demobilization costs associated with moving a drilling unit from one regional location to another, although in the current depressed market, we may not recover some or all of these costs. When market conditions require us to assume these costs, our operating margins are reduced accordingly. For shorter moves, such as “field moves,” our customers have generally agreed to assume the costs of moving the unit in the form of a reduced dayrate or “move rate” while the unit is being moved. Under current market conditions, we are much less likely to receive full reimbursement of our mobilization and demobilization costs.
During periods of depressed market conditions, such as the one we are currently experiencing, our customers may attempt to renegotiate or repudiate their contracts with us although we seek to enforce our rights under our contracts.  The renegotiations may include changes to key contract terms, such as pricing, termination and risk allocation.

Offshore Drilling Operations
Contract Drilling Services
We conduct offshore contract drilling operations, which accounted for over 99 percent of our operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. During the three years ended December 31, 2016, we principally conducted our contract drilling operations in the United States, the North Sea, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, and Brazil. Revenues from Royal Dutch Shell plc (“Shell”) and its affiliates accounted for approximately 38 percent, 49 percent and 55 percent of our consolidated operating revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Revenues from Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (“Freeport”) accounted for approximately 25 percent and 14 percent of our consolidated operating revenues in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Freeport did not account for more than 10 percent of our consolidated operating revenues in 2014. No other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated operating revenues in 2016, 2015 or 2014.
 On May 10, 2016, Freeport, Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas LLC and one of our subsidiaries entered into an agreement terminating the contracts on the Noble Sam Croft and the Noble Tom Madden (“FCX Settlement”), which were scheduled to end in July 2017 and November 2017, respectively. During 2016, we recognized approximately $393 million in “Contract drilling 
 3

services revenue” associated with the FCX Settlement. Our primary customers would have been Shell, Anadarko, and Freeport, accounting for approximately 45 percent, 11 percent, and 9 percent, respectively, of our consolidated operation revenues, excluding the $393 million of revenue attributable to the FCX Settlement. See Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 Contract Settlement and Termination Agreement with Freeport-McMoRan Inc." for further information.
Competition
The offshore contract drilling industry is a highly competitive and cyclical business characterized by large capital expenditures and high operating and maintenance costs. We compete with other providers of offshore drilling rigs. Some of our competitors may have access to greater financial resources than we do.
In the provision of contract drilling services, competition involves numerous factors, including price, rig availability and technical specification, experience of the workforce, efficiency, safety performance record, condition and age of equipment, operating integrity, reputation, financial strength, industry standing and client relations although price and technical specification are among the most important factors. We believe that we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors. In addition to having one of the newest fleets in the industry among our peer companies, we follow a policy of keeping our equipment well-maintained and technologically competitive. However, our rigs could be made obsolete by the development of new techniques and equipment, regulations or customer preferences.
We compete on a worldwide basis, but competition may vary by region. Demand for offshore drilling equipment also depends on the exploration and development programs of oil and gas companies, which in turn are influenced by many factors, including the price of oil and gas, the financial condition of such companies, general global economic conditions, energy demand, political considerations and national oil and gas policy, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, industry-wide shortages of supplies, services, skilled personnel and equipment necessary to conduct our business have historically occurred. While we do not anticipate this being an issue in the current market environment, we cannot assure that any such shortages experienced in the past will not happen again in the future.
Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters
Political developments and numerous governmental regulations, which may relate directly or indirectly to the contract drilling industry, affect many aspects of our operations. Our contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to the equipping and operation of drilling units, environmental discharges and related recordkeeping, safety management systems, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to address climate change, currency conversions and repatriation, oil and gas exploration and development, taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel and use of local employees, content and suppliers by foreign contractors. A number of countries actively regulate and control the ownership of concessions and companies holding concessions, the exportation of oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries in their countries. In addition, government actions, including initiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”), may continue to contribute to oil price volatility. In some areas of the world, this government activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work done by oil and gas companies and their need for offshore drilling services, and likely will continue to do so.
The regulations applicable to our operations include provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or require remediation of contamination under certain circumstances. Many of the countries in whose waters we operate from time to time regulate the discharge of oil and other contaminants in connection with drilling and marine operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to obtain or comply with permits, may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial requirements and the imposition of injunctions to force future compliance. We are also subject to a plea agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) in connection with prior operations in Alaska, and any future environmental incidents could have an impact on the plea agreement or related actions that the DOJ or other regulatory agencies may take against us as a result of such an incident. We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. We do not believe that our compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our competitive position or materially increase our capital expenditures. Although these requirements impact the oil and gas and energy services industries, generally they do not appear to affect us in any material respect that is different, or to any materially greater or lesser extent, than other companies in the energy services industry. However, our business and prospects could be adversely affected by regulatory activity that prohibits or restricts our customers’ exploration and production activities, results in reduced demand for our services or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to us, our customers or the oil and natural gas industry in general.
The following is a summary of some of the existing laws and regulations that apply in the United States and Europe, which serves as an example of the various laws and regulations to which we are subject. While laws vary widely in each jurisdiction, each of the laws and regulations below addresses environmental issues similar to those in most of the other jurisdictions in which we operate.

Spills and Releases. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act in the U.S. (“CERCLA”), and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, impose joint and several liabilities, without regard to fault or the legality of the original act, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the “owner” and “operator” of the site where the release occurred, past owners and operators of the site, and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Responsible parties under CERCLA may be liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. In the course of our ordinary operations, we may generate waste that may fall within CERCLA’s definition of a “hazardous substance.” However, we have to-date not received any notification that we are, or may be, potentially responsible for cleanup costs under CERCLA.
Offshore Regulation and Safety. In response to the Macondo well blowout incident in April 2010, the U.S. Department of Interior, through the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”), has undertaken an aggressive overhaul of the offshore oil and natural gas regulatory process that has significantly impacted oil and gas development in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. From time to time, new rules, regulations and requirements have been proposed and implemented by BOEM, BSEE or the United States Congress that materially limit or prohibit, and increase the cost of, offshore drilling. For example, in July 2016, BOEM and BSEE finalized a rule revising and adding planning and operational requirements for drilling on the U.S. Arctic Outer Continental Shelf. The final rule became effective September 13, 2016. Similarly, in April 2016, BSEE published a final blowout preventer systems and well control rule. This rule focuses on blowout preventer requirements and includes reforms in well design, well control, casing, cementing, real-time well monitoring and subsea containment, among other things. Additionally, in December 2016, President Obama withdrew 115 million acres in the U.S. Arctic Ocean and 3.8 million acres off the U.S. North and Mid-Atlantic coasts from future oil and gas activity under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (“OCSLA”). This withdrawal follows a March 2016 decision by BOEM to not include the Mid- and South Atlantic Program Areas from the proposed Leasing Program from 2017 to 2022. BOEM also released a new Notice to Lessees and Operators in the Outer Continental Shelf in September 2016 that updates offshore bonding requirements. BOEM also recently proposed a rule that would update identification, modeling, measuring, and tracking of air emissions from oil and gas activity in federal waters of the Western and Central Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic Ocean.
These new rules, regulations and requirements, including the adoption of new safety requirements and policies relating to the approval of drilling permits, restrictions on oil and gas development and production activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic, implementation of safety and environmental management systems, mandatory third party compliance audits, and the promulgation of numerous Notices to Lessees have impacted and may continue to impact our operations. In addition to these rules, regulations and requirements, the U.S. federal government is considering new legislation that could impose additional equipment and safety requirements on operators and drilling contractors in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, as well as regulations relating to the protection of the environment. If the new regulations, policies, operating procedures and possibility of increased legal liability are viewed by our current or future customers as a significant impairment to expected profitability on projects, then they could discontinue or curtail their offshore operations in the impacted region, thereby adversely affecting our operations by limiting drilling opportunities or imposing materially increased costs. We are also subject to the Ports and Waterways Safety Act (“PWSA”) and similar regulations, which impose certain operational requirements on offshore rigs operating in the U.S. and governs liability for vessel or cargo loss, or damage to life, property, or the marine environment.
The Oil Pollution Act. The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) and similar regulations, including but not limited to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”), adopted by the International Maritime Organization (“IMO”), as enforced in the United States through the domestic implementing law called the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, impose certain operational requirements on offshore rigs operating in the U.S. and govern liability for leaks, spills and blowouts involving pollutants. OPA imposes strict, joint and several liabilities on “responsible parties” for damages, including natural resource damages, resulting from oil spills into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. A “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility and the lessee or permit holder of the area in which an offshore facility is located. OPA initially established a liability limit for onshore facilities of $350 million, which was subsequently increased to $633.85 million by a U.S. Coast Guard final rule in November 2015. Liability for offshore facilities was initially limited to all removal costs plus up to $75 million in other damages; however, BOEM increased this liability limit to $133.65 million in December 2014. These liability limits may not apply if a spill is caused by a party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, if the spill resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation, or if a party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a clean-up.
Regulations under OPA require owners and operators of rigs in United States waters to maintain certain levels of financial responsibility. The failure to comply with OPA’s requirements may subject a responsible party to civil, criminal, or administrative enforcement actions. We are not aware of any action or event that would subject us to liability under OPA, and we believe that compliance with OPA’s financial assurance and other operating requirements will not have a material impact on our operations or financial condition.
 5

Waste Handling. The U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and similar state, local and foreign laws and regulations govern the management of wastes, including the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. RCRA imposes stringent operating requirements, and liability for failure to meet such requirements, on a person who is either a “generator” or “transporter” of hazardous waste or an “owner” or “operator” of a hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal facility. RCRA and many state counterparts specifically exclude from the definition of hazardous waste drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil and natural gas. As a result, our operations generate minimal quantities of RCRA hazardous wastes. However, these wastes may be regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or state agencies as solid waste. In addition, ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes, and waste compressor oils may be regulated under RCRA as hazardous waste. We do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes, as they are presently classified, to be significant. However, any repeal or modification of this or similar exemption in similar state statutes, would increase the volume of hazardous waste we are required to manage and dispose of, and would cause us, as well as our competitors, to incur increased operating expenses with respect to our U.S. operations.
Water Discharges. The U.S. Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the “Clean Water Act,” and similar state laws and regulations impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into federal and state waters. These laws also regulate the discharge of storm water in process areas. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we are required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater and storm water. In addition, the U.S. Coast Guard has promulgated requirements for ballast water management as well as supplemental ballast water requirements, which include limits applicable to specific discharge streams, such as deck runoff, bilge water and gray water. We do not anticipate that compliance with these laws will cause a material impact on our operations or financial condition.
Air Emissions. The U.S. Federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including oil and natural gas operations. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before operations can commence, and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits, and incur capital costs, in order to remain in compliance. The EPA is responsible for regulating air emissions on the Outer Continental Shelf apart from the Western and Central Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic Ocean, which are regulated by BOEM under OCSLA. In April 2016, BOEM proposed a rule that would impose new requirements for the identification, modeling, measuring, and tracking of air emissions from oil and gas activities in these regions. The proposed rule is aimed at updating BOEM’s air quality regulations to be more consistent with EPA’s current regulation of the national ambient air quality standards (“NAAQS”). Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. In general, we believe that compliance with the Clean Air Act and similar state laws and regulations will not have a material impact on our operations or financial condition.
Climate Change. There is increasing attention concerning the issue of climate change and the effect of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. The EPA regulates the permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Clean Air Act’s Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) and Title V permitting programs, which require the use of “best available control technology” for GHG emissions from new and modified major stationary sources, which can sometimes include drillships. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among other things, certain onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis. Facilities containing petroleum and natural gas systems that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2 equivalent per year are now required to report annual GHG emissions to the EPA.
Further, proposed legislation has been introduced in Congress that would establish an economy-wide cap on emissions of GHG’s in the United States and would require most sources of GHG emissions to obtain GHG emission “allowances” corresponding to their annual emissions of GHG’s. Moreover, in 2005, the Kyoto Protocol to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which establishes a binding set of emission targets for GHGs, became binding on all countries that had ratified it. In 2015, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris resulted in the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement was signed on April 22, 2016 and requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. While it is not possible at this time to predict how new treaties and legislation that may be enacted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and gas could materially and adversely affect our operations by limiting drilling opportunities or imposing materially increased costs. Moreover, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could have a negative impact on our business if such incentives reduce the worldwide demand for oil and gas.
Countries in the European Union ("EU") implement the U.N.’s Kyoto Protocol on GHG emissions through the Emissions Trading System (“ETS”), though ETS will continue to require GHG reductions in the future that are not currently prescribed by the Kyoto Protocol or related agreements. The ETS program establishes a GHG “cap and trade” system for certain industry sectors, including power generation at some offshore facilities. Total GHG from these sectors is capped, and the cap is reduced over time to achieve a 21 percent GHG reduction from these sectors between 2005 and 2020. In July 2015, the European Commission presented a legislative proposal to revise the European Union ETS for the period after 2020 that includes a more rapid reduction 
 6

in emission allowances, among other suggestions. This revision would also increase the 21 percent GHG reduction target for ETS sectors discussed above to 43 percent by 2030. The European Parliament and Council have yet to adopt legislation relating to this proposal. More generally, the EU Commission has proposed a roadmap for reducing emissions by 80 percent by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. Some EU member states have enacted additional and more long-term legally binding targets. For example, the UK has committed to reduce GHG emissions by 80 percent by 2050. These reduction targets may also be affected by future negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement.
Entities operating over the cap must either reduce their GHG emissions or purchase tradable emissions allowances, or EUAs, from other program participants, or purchase international GHG offset credits generated under the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanisms or Joint Implementation for international carbon trading after 2020. However, the Paris Agreement provides for the creation of a new market-based mechanism that could replace the Clean Development Mechanisms and Joint Implementation. As the cap declines, prices for emissions allowances or GHG offset credits may rise. However, due to the over-allocation of EUAs by EU member states in earlier phases and the impact of the recession in the EU, there has been a general over-supply of EUAs. The EU has recently approved amending legislation to withhold the auction of EUAs in a process known as “back-loading.” EU proposals for wider structural reform of the EU ETS may follow the enactment of the back-loading legislation. For example, in July and October 2015, the European Parliament and Council, respectively, approved a Market Stability Reserve. The Market Stability Reserve will start operating in January 2019 and is intended as a long-term solution to the oversupply. Both back-loading and wider structural reforms are aimed at reviving the EU carbon price.
In addition, the UK government, which implements ETS in the UK North Sea, has introduced a carbon price floor mechanism to place an incrementally increasing minimum price on carbon. Thus, the cost of compliance with ETS can be expected to increase over time. Additional member state climate change legislation may result in potentially material capital expenditures.
We have determined that combustion of diesel fuel (Scope 1) aboard all of our vessels worldwide is the Company’s primary source of GHG emissions, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. The data necessary to report indirect emissions from generation of purchased power (Scope 2) has not been previously collected. We will establish the necessary procedures to collect and report Scope 2 data.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, our estimated carbon dioxide equivalent (“CO2e”) gas emissions were 483,111 tonnes as compared to 625,829 tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decline in emissions was mostly due to a decrease in drillship engine use. When expressed as an intensity measure of tonnes of CO2e gas emissions per dollar of contract drilling revenues from continuing operations, both the 2016 and 2015 intensity measure was .0002.
Our Scope 1 CO2e gas emissions reporting has been prepared with reference to the requirements set out in the UK Companies Act 2006 Regulations 2013, the Environmental Reporting Guidelines (June 2013) issued by the Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs, the World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard Revised and the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 14064-1, “Specification with guidance at the organizational level for quantification and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals (2006).” We have used SANGEA™ Emissions Estimation Software to estimate CO2e gas of Scope 1 emissions based on diesel fuel consumption.
It is our intent to have the procedures related to GHG emissions independently assessed in the future.
Worker Safety. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and other similar laws and regulations govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communication standard, EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governments and citizens. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these requirements and with other applicable OSHA requirements.
On June 10, 2013, the European Union adopted a new directive, Directive 2013/30/EU, on the safety of offshore oil and gas operations within the exclusive economic zone (which can extend up to 200 nautical miles from a coast) or the continental shelf of any of its member states. The directive establishes minimum requirements for preventing major accidents in offshore oil and gas operations, and aims to limit the consequences of such accidents. All European Union member states were required to adopt national legislation or regulations by July 19, 2015 to implement the new directive’s requirements, which also include reporting requirements related to major safety and environmental hazards that must be satisfied before drilling can take place, as well as the use of “all suitable measures” to both prevent major accidents and limit the human health and environmental consequences of such a major accident should one occur. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the requirements of the directive (as well as the extensive current health and safety regimes implemented in the member states in which we operate), but future developments could require the Company to incur significant costs to comply with its implementation.
International Regulatory Regime. The International Maritime Organization (“IMO”) provides international regulations governing shipping and international maritime trade. IMO regulations have been widely adopted by U.N. member countries, and in some jurisdictions in which we operate, these regulations have been expanded upon. The requirements contained in the 
 7

International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention, or ISM Code, promulgated by the IMO, govern much of our drilling operations. Among other requirements, the ISM Code requires the party with operational control of a vessel to develop an extensive safety management system that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for operating its vessels safely and describing procedures for responding to emergencies.
The IMO has also adopted MARPOL, including Annex VI to MARPOL which sets limits on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ship exhausts and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances. Annex VI, which applies to all ships, fixed and floating drilling rigs and other floating platforms, imposes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for specialized areas to be established internationally with even more stringent controls on sulfur emissions. For vessels 400 gross tons and greater, platforms and drilling rigs, Annex VI imposes various survey and certification requirements. On July 15, 2011, the IMO approved mandatory measures to reduce emissions of GHGs from international shipping, requiring energy efficiency and survey and certification measures. These amendments to Annex VI apply to all ships of 400 gross tonnage and above and entered into force on January 1, 2013, affecting the operations of vessels that are registered in countries that are signatories to MARPOL Annex VI or vessels that call upon ports located within such countries. Moreover, 2008 amendments to Annex VI require the imposition of progressively stricter limitations on sulfur emissions from ships. These amendments required that, as of January 1, 2015, the sulfur content of marine fuel in SOx Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”) be limited to 0.10 percent m/m (mass by mass). The North American ECA became effective in August 2012. The North Sea and Baltic Sea ECAs have been in place since July 1, 2010. The North Sea ECA encompasses all of the North Sea and the full length of the English Channel. These regulations also established a global cap on the marine fuel sulfur content of 3.50 percent m/m in non-ECA areas that will decrease progressively to a 0.5 percent m/m cap by January 1, 2020. The amendments also establish new tiers of stringent nitrogen oxide emissions standards for new marine engines, depending on their date of installation.
The IMO has negotiated international conventions that impose liability for oil pollution in international waters and the territorial waters of the signatory to such conventions such as the Ballast Water Management Convention, or BWM Convention. The BWM Convention’s implementing regulations call for a phased introduction of mandatory ballast water exchange requirements (beginning in 2009), to be replaced in time with a requirement for mandatory ballast water treatment. The BWM Convention will enter into force on September 8, 2017, after having reached its 35 percent ratification trigger in September 2016. Upon the BWM Convention’s entry into force, all vessels in international traffic are to comply with the ballast water exchange standard. Thereafter, vessels will be required to meet the more stringent ballast water performance standard no later than the first intermediate or renewal survey following the Convention’s entry into force. All of our drilling rigs are in substantial compliance with the proposed terms of the BWM Convention.
The IMO has also adopted the International Convention for Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage of 2001, or Bunker Convention. The Bunker Convention provides a liability, compensation and compulsory insurance system for the victims of oil pollution damage caused by spills of bunker oil. Under the Bunker Convention, ship owners must pay compensation for pollution damage (including the cost of preventive measures) caused in the territory, including the territorial sea of a State Party, as well as its exclusive economic zone or equivalent area. Registered owners of any seagoing vessel and seaborne craft over 1,000 gross tons, of any type whatsoever, and registered in a State Party, or entering or leaving a port in the territory of a State Party, must maintain insurance which meets the requirements of the Bunker Convention and to obtain a certificate issued by a State Party attesting that such insurance is in force. The State issued certificate must be carried on board at all times. We believe that all of our drilling rigs are currently compliant in all material respects with these regulations.
The IMO continues to review and introduce new regulations. It is impossible to predict what additional regulations, if any, may be passed by the IMO and what effect, if any, such regulation may have on our operations.
Insurance and Indemnification Matters
Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling business, including blowouts, fires, collisions, groundings, punch-throughs, and damage or loss from adverse weather and sea conditions. These hazards could cause personal injury or loss of life, loss of revenues, pollution and other environmental damage, damage to or destruction of property and equipment and oil and natural gas producing formations, and could result in claims by employees, customers or third parties and fines and penalties.
Our drilling contracts provide for varying levels of indemnification from our customers and in most cases also require us to indemnify our customers for certain losses. Under our drilling contracts, liability with respect to personnel and property is typically assigned on a “knock-for-knock” basis, which means that we and our customers assume liability for our respective personnel and property, generally irrespective of the fault or negligence of the party indemnified. In addition, our customers may indemnify us in certain instances for damage to our down-hole equipment and, in some cases, our subsea equipment. Also, we generally obtain a mutual waiver of consequential losses in our drilling contracts. 
Our customers typically assume responsibility for and indemnify us from loss or liability resulting from pollution or contamination, including third-party damages and clean-up and removal, arising from operations under the contract and originating

below the surface of the water. We are generally responsible for pollution originating above the surface of the water and emanating from our drilling units. Additionally, our customers typically indemnify us for liabilities incurred as a result of a blow-out or cratering of the well and underground reservoir loss or damage.
In addition to the contractual indemnities described above, we also carry Protection and Indemnity (“P&I”) insurance, which is a comprehensive general liability insurance program covering liability resulting from offshore operations. Our P&I insurance includes coverage for liability resulting from personal injury or death of third parties and our offshore employees, third-party property damage, pollution, spill clean-up and containment and removal of wrecks or debris. Our P&I insurance program is renewed in April of each year and currently has a standard deductible of $10 million per occurrence, with maximum liability coverage of $750 million. We also carry hull and machinery insurance that protects us again physical loss or damage to our drilling rigs, subject to a deductible. 
Our insurance policies and contractual rights to indemnity may not adequately cover our losses and liabilities in all cases. For additional information, please read “We may have difficulty obtaining or maintaining insurance in the future and our insurance coverage and contractual indemnity rights may not protect us against all of the risks and hazards we face” included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The above description of our insurance program and the indemnification provisions of our drilling contracts is only a summary as of the time of preparation of this report, and is general in nature. Our insurance program and the terms of our drilling contracts may change in the future. In addition, the indemnification provisions of our drilling contracts may be subject to differing interpretations, and enforcement of those provisions may be limited by public policy and other considerations.
Employees
At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 2,100 employees, excluding approximately 700 persons we engaged through labor contractors or agencies. Approximately 84 percent of our workforce is located offshore. Of our shorebased employees, approximately 70 percent are male. We are not a party to any material collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
We place considerable value on the involvement of our employees and maintain a practice of keeping them informed on matters affecting them, as well as on the performance of the Company. Accordingly, we conduct formal and informal meetings with employees, maintain a Company intranet website with matters of interest, issue periodic publications of Company activities and other matters of interest, and offer a variety of in-house training.
We are committed to a policy of recruitment and promotion on the basis of aptitude and ability without discrimination of any kind. Management actively pursues both the employment of disabled persons whenever a suitable vacancy arises and the continued employment and retraining of employees who become disabled while employed by the Company. Training and development is undertaken for all employees, including disabled persons.
