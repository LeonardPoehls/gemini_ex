ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of GGP Inc. ("GGP" or the "Company") and related notes, as included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Annual Report"). The terms "we," "us" and "our" may also be used to refer to GGP and its subsidiaries. On January 17, 2017, General Growth Properties, Inc. announced that effective January 27, 2017, the Company changed its name from General Growth Properties, Inc. to GGP Inc. GGP, a Delaware corporation, was organized in July 2010 and is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, referred to as a "REIT".
Our Company and Strategy
GGP is a retail real estate company. Our primary business is owning and operating best-in-class retail properties that provide an outstanding environment and experience for our communities, retailers, employees, consumers and shareholders. We are an S&P 500 real estate company with a property portfolio predominantly comprised of Class A retail real estate (defined primarily by sales per square foot). Our retail properties are the core centers of retail, dining, and entertainment within their trade areas and, therefore, represent hubs of such activity. As of December 31, 2016, we own, either entirely or with joint venture partners, 127 retail properties located throughout the United States comprising approximately 125 million square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA").
Our portfolio generated total comparable tenant sales (all less anchors) of $20.5 billion and comparable tenant sales (<10,000 square feet) of $569 per square foot during 2016. We have 75 Class A retail properties reporting tenant sales (all less anchors) of $16.6 billion and tenant sales (<10,000 square feet) of $644 per square foot that contribute approximately 81% of our share of Company net operating income ("Company NOI" as defined in Item 7). The quality of our portfolio is further summarized in the table below which indicates the 75 Class A retail properties and their contribution to our 2016 share of Company NOI. Sales (all less anchors) is presented as total sales volume in millions of dollars and sales (<10,000 sq ft) is presented as sales per square foot in dollars.

75 Class A Retail Properties | 16,567 | | | 16,385 | | | 644 | | 649 | | 1.1 | % | 81.0 | % 

(1) The table excludes Christiana Mall.
Overall, traffic at our properties is up and our tenant sales data shows this over the course of 2016. Our long-term earnings growth is driven by:
1)contractual rent increases;
2)occupancy growth;
3)positive leasing spreads;
4)value creation from redevelopment projects;
5)managing operating expenses; and
6)strategic acquisitions and dispositions that recycle capital.
We have identified approximately $1.3 billion of income producing development and redevelopment projects within our portfolio, over 80% of which is being invested into Class A retail properties.
We believe our long-term strategy can provide our shareholders with a competitive risk-adjusted total return comprised of dividends and share price appreciation.

Transactions and Highlights
During 2016, the following achievements promoted our long-term strategy as summarized below (figures shown represent our proportionate share):

• | initial rental rates for signed leases that commenced in 2016 on a suite-to-suite basis increased 10.1% when compared to the rental rate for expiring leases;


• | tenant sales (all less anchors) increased 0.9% on a trailing 12-month basis for 2016;


• | leased percentage was 97.2% at December 31, 2016 (as defined in Item 7);


• | invested $547.4 million in development and redevelopment of our properties;


• | sold interests in eight properties for total gross proceeds at share of $604.3 million, which resulted in a net gain of $132.1 million (Note 3);


• | sold a 50% interest in Fashion Show located in Las Vegas, Nevada to a joint venture partner for a gross sales price of $1.25 billion, which resulted in a gain of $634.9 million (Note 3);


• | acquired interests in five properties for a total gross purchase price at share of $278.3 million including anchor boxes that will provide opportunities for redevelopment (Note 3); and


• | acquired the remaining 50% interest in Riverchase Galleria in Hoover, Alabama for a gross purchase price of $143.5 million including the assumption of our venture partner's $110.3 million share of property level debt (Note 3).

Segments
We operate in a single reportable segment, which includes the operation, development and management of retail and other rental properties. Our portfolio is targeted to a range of market sizes and consumer tastes. Each of our operating properties is considered a separate operating segment, as each property earns revenues and incurs expenses, individual operating results are reviewed and discrete financial information is available. The Company's chief operating decision maker is comprised of a team of several members of executive management who use Company NOI in assessing segment operating performance. We do not distinguish or group our consolidated operations based on geography, size or type for purposes of making property operating decisions. Our operating properties have similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services to our tenants. There are no individual operating segments that are greater than 10% of combined revenue, Company NOI, or combined assets. Further, all material operations are within the United States and no customer or tenant comprises more than 10% of consolidated revenues. As a result, the Company's operating properties are aggregated into a single reportable segment.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, our largest tenant, L Brands, Inc., (based on common parent ownership) accounted for approximately 4% of rents. Our three largest tenants, L Brands, Inc., The Gap, Inc., and Foot Locker, Inc., in aggregate, comprised approximately 9.2% of rents.
Competition
In order to maintain and increase our competitive position within a marketplace we:

• | strategically locate tenants within each property to achieve a merchandising strategy that promotes traffic, cross-shopping and maximizes sales;


• | introduce new concepts to the property which may include restaurants, theaters, grocery stores, first-to-market retailers, and e-commerce retailers;


• | invest capital to provide the right environment for our tenants and consumers, including aesthetic, technological, and infrastructure improvements; and


• | ensure our properties are clean, secure and comfortable.

We believe the high-quality nature of our properties enables us to compete effectively for retailers and consumers.

Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state or local laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real estate may be liable for the costs of remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on such real estate. These laws may impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of remediation may be substantial and may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell or borrow against such real estate as collateral. In connection with the ownership and operation of our properties, we, or the relevant joint venture through which the property is owned, may be liable for such costs.
Substantially all of our properties have been subject to a Phase I environmental site assessment, which is intended to evaluate the environmental condition of the subject property and its surroundings. Phase I environmental assessments typically include a historical review, a public records review, a site visit and interviews, but do not include sampling or subsurface investigations.
As of December 31, 2016, the Phase I environmental site assessments have not revealed any environmental conditions that would have a material adverse effect on our overall business, financial condition or results of operations. However, it is possible that these assessments do not reveal all potential environmental liabilities or that conditions have changed since the assessment was prepared (typically, at the time the property was purchased or developed).
See Risk Factors regarding additional discussion of environmental matters.
Other Policies
The following is a discussion of our investment policies, financing policies, conflict of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other activities. One or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote.
Investment Policies
The Company elected to be treated as a REIT commencing with the taxable year beginning July 1, 2010, its date of incorporation. REIT limitations restrict us from making investments that would cause our real estate assets to be less than 75% of our total assets. In addition, at least 75% of our gross income must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property, including "rents from real property," dividends from other REITs and, in certain circumstances, interest from certain types of temporary investments. At least 95% of our income must be derived from such real property investments, and from dividends, interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing.
Subject to REIT limitations, we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate. Such an investment would normally be in the form of a general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties. We may, in the future, acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs, management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies.
Financing Policies
We do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property. We generally seek to finance individual properties on a secured basis and ladder our maturities. Mortgage financing instruments usually limit additional indebtedness on those properties. Typically, we invest in or form separate legal entities to assist us in obtaining permanent financing at attractive terms. Permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a single property, or on a group of properties, and generally requires us to provide a mortgage interest on the property in favor of an institutional third party or as a securitized financing. These legal entities are structured so that they would not necessarily be consolidated in the event we became subject to a bankruptcy proceeding or liquidation. We decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives. We seek to minimize corporate recourse and cross collateralization and generally adhere to investment grade secured debt levels. We include the outstanding securitized debt of legal entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness.
We are party to a revolving credit facility that requires us to satisfy certain affirmative and negative covenants and to meet financial ratios and tests, which may include ratios and tests based on leverage, interest coverage and net worth.
If our Board of Directors determines to seek additional capital, we may raise that capital through additional public equity or preferred equity offerings, public debt offerings, debt financing, by creating joint ventures with existing ownership interests in properties or a combination of these methods. Our ability to retain cash flow is limited by the requirement for REITs to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income. We are also subject to federal income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, including capital gains.

If our Board of Directors determines to raise additional equity capital, it may, without stockholder approval, issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock. The Board of Directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate. Such securities may be senior to the outstanding classes of common stock. Such securities also may include additional classes of preferred stock, which may be convertible into common stock. Any such offering could dilute a stockholder's investment in us. Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (including certain of its affiliates, "Brookfield") has preemptive rights to purchase our common stock as necessary to allow it to maintain its respective proportional ownership interest in GGP on a fully diluted basis.
We have a dividend reinvestment plan ("DRIP"). We may determine to pay dividends in a combination of cash and shares of common stock.
Conflict of Interest Policies
We maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest. We have adopted governance principles governing our affairs and the Board of Directors, as well as written charters for each of the standing committees of the Board of Directors. In addition, we have a Code of Conduct that applies to all of our officers, directors, and employees. At least a majority of the members of our Board of Directors must qualify as independent under the listing standards for NYSE companies. Any transaction between us and any director, officer or 5% stockholder must be approved pursuant to our Related Party Transaction Policy, including such transactions with Brookfield (as defined above), our largest stockholder.
Policies With Respect To Certain Other Activities
We intend to make investments that are consistent with our qualification as a REIT, unless the Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to qualify as a REIT. We have authority to offer shares of our common stock or other securities in exchange for property. We also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities. We may issue shares of our common stock, or cash at our option, to holders of units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnerships (as defined in Note 1) in future periods upon exercise of such holders' rights under the Operating Partnerships' agreements. Our policy prohibits us from making any loans to our directors or executive officers for any purpose. We may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate.
Employees
As of January 27, 2017, we had approximately 1,800 employees.
Insurance
We have comprehensive liability, property and rental loss insurance with respect to our portfolio of properties. We believe that such insurance provides adequate coverage.
Qualification as a REIT
The Company intends to maintain REIT status, and therefore our operations generally will not be subject to federal income tax on real estate investment trust taxable income. A schedule detailing the taxability of dividends for 2016, 2015 and 2014 has been presented in Note 11.
