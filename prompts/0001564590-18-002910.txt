 BUSINESS 
 Overview 
 As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “we,” “us”, “our”, “the Company” and “BSQUARE” refer to BSQUARE Corporation.
 Since our inception, our business has largely been focused on providing software solutions (historically, including reselling software from Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”)) and related engineering services to businesses that develop, market and sell dedicated-purpose standalone intelligent systems. Examples of dedicated-purpose standalone intelligent systems include smart, connected computing devices such as smart phones, set-top boxes, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, tablets and handheld data collection devices, as well as smart vending machines, ATM machines, digital signs and in-vehicle telematics and entertainment devices. We focus on systems that utilize various Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems as well as devices running other popular operating systems such as Android, Linux, and QNX, and that are usually connected to a network via a wired or wireless connection. Our customers include world-class original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), original design manufacturers (“ODMs”), corporate enterprises (“Enterprises”), silicon vendors (“SVs”) and peripheral vendors. A significant portion of our business historically has also been focused on reselling software from Microsoft, from which a majority of our revenue currently continues to be derived.
 Beginning in early 2014, we initiated development efforts focused on new proprietary software products addressing the Industrial Internet of Things (“IIoT”) market, by interconnecting of uniquely identifiable devices, extracting data from those devices and applying advanced analytics and machine learning to the data in order to derive meaningful and actionable insights. While IIoT is a relatively new market, we believe the work we have engaged in since our inception—namely adding intelligence and connectivity to discrete standalone devices and systems—embodies much of what is central to the core functionality of IIoT. These software development efforts have driven a new business initiative for BSQUARE, which we refer to as DataV™. Our DataV solution includes software products, applications and services that are designed to turn raw IIoT device data into meaningful and actionable data for our customers. 
 We launched DataV late in the first quarter of 2016 and announced our first three major customer bookings later that year. These bookings comprised software licensing, software maintenance and related systems integration services and are, we believe, indicative of the potential customer demand for DataV. During 2017 we began selling data analytics services and DataV application pilots to major industrial customers primarily in the transportation, oil and gas and manufacturing vertical markets, and signed four pilots in the first six months of 2017 and another fifteen pilots in the second half of 2017, the majority of which are still ongoing.

We believe that DataV presents high growth opportunities in a large, expanding addressable market, at substantially higher gross margins as compared to our traditional business. Developing, selling and implementing DataV has become our primary focus, as approximately 65% of our non-administrative employees are now working solely on DataV, representing a transition away from dependence on resale software and professional engineering services toward increased reliance on our own proprietary software and related systems integration services. We intend to continue to run our legacy software resale business to maximize cash flow for the foreseeable future. Our legacy professional engineering services business is now managed as a part of our overall services business, which increasingly serves DataV customers and prospects.
 We were incorporated in the State of Washington in July 1994. Our principal office is located at 110 110th Avenue NE, Suite 300, Bellevue, Washington 98004, and our telephone number is (425) 519-5900. 
 Industry Background 
 The IIoT market is still emerging, but we believe it will present a large market opportunity for us. This market includes consumer, business, government and industrial segments. It encompasses software, hardware, connectivity and cloud providers as well as systems integrators. While larger research firms do not yet widely track the size of the IIoT market, available research indicates to us that over time, the deployment of hundreds of billions of connected devices may generate trillions of dollars of economic value.
 The IIoT marketplace is currently being influenced by the following factors: 
  
• | Development of machine learning and data analytics software that advances the understanding of complex systems but lacks the capability to effectively process the proliferation of resulting data. This provides an opportunity for solutions such as DataV to develop models of complex mechanical equipment that can be used for predictive reasoning;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Nearly ubiquitous wireless connectivity, including near-field communications (“NFC”), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and cellular, allowing connectivity and data exchange with large populations of small, remote, and frequently mobile devices;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasing competitive pressures that are forcing a wide array of businesses to invest in automation as a way to improve productivity, reduce costs, and enhance the value of their own offerings; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The increasing availability of inexpensive cloud computing and storage capabilities able to scale to the extent likely to be demanded by IIoT.

Software
 DataV Software
 DataV is BSQUARE’s proprietary comprehensive software solution which addresses a variety of business use cases specific to IIoT applications, including:
  
• | Predictive Failure: By employing machine learning and advanced data analytics, DataV can predict, with varying levels of accuracy, future operational conditions for equipment or devices that are part of the overall IIoT system. For many industrial concerns, the operational condition of greatest interest is a failure state. By being able to predict failures before they occur, DataV customers can take steps to remediate the condition more quickly, less expensively and with less operational disruption. DataV can also develop maintenance schedules from actual equipment usage and environmental data, reducing overall service costs and improving asset longevity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Adaptive Diagnostics: For equipment that has already failed, DataV can dynamically proscribe diagnostic and repair steps that have the highest probability of quickly and more cost-effectively resolving the problem. DataV employs machine learning, data analytics, and historical repair data to help customers identify underperforming assets and proscribe remediation steps to optimize performance.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | IIoT Device Management: The spread of data-generating devices in IIoT systems introduces a new set of operational problems for industrial concerns. DataV can facilitate IIoT device management, including software and configuration updates, over large-scale populations of connected devices.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Asset Utilization: DataV can assist customers in tracking how their products are used in the field. This can help ensure that equipment is used as intended, an important requirement for customers such as heavy equipment rental firms. It can also provide product designers with feedback that can help improve product performance and differentiation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our DataV solution is designed to be implemented in a wide variety of industrial sectors and vertical markets, including commercial transportation, oil and gas extraction, manufacturing, water and power and other vertical markets. These industrial sectors share common operational characteristics, such as the dependence on complex capital equipment where the cost of failure or sub-optimal performance is relatively high. In other cases, our customers are seeking new revenue-generating products or services to enhance operating profitability. In the future, we will be making DataV available through a software as a service (“SaaS“) revenue model. We currently provide DataV software through hosted subscription or perpetual licensing models. 
 We officially launched DataV as a commercially available product in March 2016. We secured our first order in May 2016 from PACCAR, Inc., a heavy-duty truck manufacturer, to employ adaptive diagnostics in order to more rapidly service and repair trucks. This order, valued at $4.3 million, included a perpetual license to use DataV for that specific application on certain engine types in North America, as well as custom systems integration services and annual software maintenance fees. We delivered the software and custom services in the first quarter of 2017, resulting in our first major DataV revenue.
 In November 2016, we secured our second DataV order from Itron, Inc., a large global manufacturer of electric, water, and gas meters for utilities as well as smart city solutions targeting IIoT device management. This order, valued at $4.8 million, included $1.9 million for the first year and a $2.9 million four-year extension option, and included a subscription license to use DataV in addition to maintenance and systems integration services. In November 2017, Itron renewed its subscription exercising its extension option. We are in the final stages of completing our hosted software delivery and expect Itron to accept delivery in early 2018.
 In December 2016, we secured an order from a global provider of candy and beverages to help fulfill their smart vending initiative that adds intelligence to existing fleets of vending machines, better tracks real-time sales data and, in the future, better predicts equipment failures within these machines. We expect this solution to be rolled out in phases beginning in the first quarter of 2018, providing expansion opportunities with increasing machine volumes and geographic territories.
 In March 2017, we announced a series of applications, or apps, offering solutions addressing an array of business use cases. These apps are designed to be platform agnostic and to be deployed on Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) or Microsoft Azure. We entered into four customer pilot agreements in the second quarter of 2017, seven pilot agreements in the third quarter and eight pilot agreements in the fourth quarter, for a total of 19 new customer pilot agreements in 2017. Most of these pilots are still ongoing.

 See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for more information regarding our relationship with Microsoft. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We market our products and professional engineering services utilizing a direct sales model. We have sales personnel throughout the United States and in the United Kingdom. Historically, we have not made significant use of resellers, channel partners, representative agents or other indirect channels. We are investigating alternative ways to leverage existing relationships with AWS and Microsoft Azure, as well as developing new relationships with technology partners alongside our direct sales force to enhance our DataV sales efforts and initiatives.
 Key elements of our sales and marketing strategy include direct marketing, content marketing, trade shows, event marketing, public relations, analyst relations, social media properties, customer and strategic alliance partner co-marketing programs and a comprehensive website.
 Research and Development 
 During 2017, substantially all of our research and development personnel were dedicated to the design, development and release of DataV, and we expect this to continue to be the case for the foreseeable future. Members of our research and development staff work closely with our sales and marketing departments, as well as with our customers and potential customers, 
 6
 

to better understand IIoT market needs and requirements. We perform our research and development primarily utilizing engineering staff located in the United States. Research and development expense was $6.6 million and $2.9 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 Customers 
 Targeted customers for DataV include large industrial concerns that either manufacture capital assets, such as a heavy-duty commercial truck manufacturer, or rely on the widespread deployment of capital assets in the operation of their businesses, such as a large for-hire fleet operator. DataV customers may also include manufacturers incorporating DataV within their own offerings in order to enhance capabilities, such as an electric meter manufacturer developing smart grid technology for power utilities.
 Customers purchasing third-party software and our other proprietary software solutions and professional engineering services include leading OEMs, ODMs, Enterprises, SVs and peripheral vendors. Representative customers include Hewlett Packard, Google, Coca-Cola, Elo Touch Solutions, Honeywell International, Inc., IGT, Microsoft, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Panasonic, Oracle, Omnicell, Elektrobit and several industrial handset companies. 
 Competition 
 The IIoT market is still emerging but is already becoming increasingly competitive. Our competitors in this space include, or we anticipate could include, the following:
  
• | Large, established enterprise software and solution providers such as IBM, SAS, Oracle and SAP;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cloud IIoT providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, and General Electric (“GE”) Predix. Although we are closely partnered with AWS and Microsoft, there are elements of their solutions with which we compete directly;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mid-sized companies engaged in business transitions similar to our own, including PTC ThingWorx; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Startups funded to enter the IIoT market, including C3IOT and others.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, we anticipate that we will encounter increasing competition in the growing IIoT market from a number of additional software and service providers as we continue to expand our focus on this market in 2018 and beyond.
 The market for device software and engineering services is extremely competitive. We face competition from the following: 
  
• | Our current and potential customers’ internal research and development departments, which may seek to develop their own software solutions which could compete with our proprietary software products and engineering services;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Engineering service firms, including off-shore development companies, such as Adeneo, SymphonyTeleca and Wipro;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ODMs, particularly those in Taiwan and China, with their own software development capabilities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Contract manufacturers with their own software development capabilities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mobile and embedded test automation providers including Perfecto Mobile, mVerify, JAMO Solutions, SmartBear Software (AutomatedQA), TestPlant (eggPlant) and Keynote, as well as our customers’ and potential customers’ internally created tools and manual testing capabilities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system distributors such as Arrow Electronics, Inc. Avnet, Inc. and Synnex Corporation; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Marketing agencies and specialized vendors who provide mobile application services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some of our competitors focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products that can be integrated with our products. As we develop and bring to market new software products and service offerings, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed. Further, as we expand the geographic markets into which we sell our software solutions and related services, or increase our penetration therein, we may expect to increasingly compete with companies with which we have not previously competed. It is also likely that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with Microsoft or Amazon, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share. New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing. We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the connected device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced.
 Neither Microsoft nor Amazon has agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us, nor has either agreed not to compete with us. Amazon may decide to focus on providing products or services that compete directly with our products and services or partnering with other solution providers that compete with us. Microsoft may decide to bring more of the core embedded development 
 7
 

services and expertise that we provide in-house, possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunities for us. The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Microsoft-based smart connected systems software and services is low. In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system software and services. These systems integrators are given substantially the same access by Microsoft to Microsoft technology as we are. 
 International Operations 
 Our international operations outside of North America consist principally of engineering services operations in Taipei, Taiwan and Trowbridge, England. We have also maintained a sales and sales support office in Tokyo, Japan. Because our OEM Distribution Agreement with Microsoft for the sale of Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems (e.g. Windows Embedded Compact) has previously been restricted to North America, the majority of our revenue continues to be generated from North America. In 2017, revenue generated from customers located outside of North America was 6% of total revenue, compared to 5% in 2016.
 See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for more information regarding our international operations. 
 Personnel 
 Our headcount by area was as follows: 
  
 | December 31, | 
----------------------------------------------------------+--------------+----
 | 2017 | | 2016
Professional engineering services | | 51 | | 78 
Sales, marketing and administrative | | 78 | | 70 
Research and product development | | 63 | | 21 
Total employees | | 192 | | 169
Contractors (primarily professional engineering services) | | 6 | | 3 
Total headcount | | 198 | | 172

 Of the total headcount at December 31, 2017, 147 were located in North America, 22 in Taiwan, 28 in the United Kingdom and one in Japan. As conditions necessitate, professional engineering service employees perform research and development activities and vice versa. 
 Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights 
 In general, we strive to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and through contractual arrangements. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be effective to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to, or competitive with, those developed by us. 
 Additionally, because a significant portion of our revenue relates to the sale of third-party software products, we also rely on our partners, particularly Microsoft, to appropriately protect their own intellectual property. 
 As of January 31, 2018, we had fourteen pending United States (“US”) patent applications related to DataV, in addition to nine issued US patents related to other products and services. We also have a number of registered trademarks in various jurisdictions. We will continue to pursue appropriate protections for our intellectual property. 
 See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for more information regarding our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
