 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
     GENERAL
     Atlantic Power owns and operates a diverse fleet of power generation assets in the United States and Canada. Our power generation projects sell electricity to utilities and other large commercial customers largely under long‑term PPAs, which seek to minimize exposure to changes in commodity prices. As of December 31, 2016, our power generation projects had an aggregate gross electric generation capacity of approximately 2,138 megawatts (“MW”) in which our aggregate ownership interest is approximately 1,500 MW. Our current portfolio consists of interests in twenty-three power generation projects across nine states in the United States and two provinces in Canada. Nineteen of the projects are currently operational, totaling 1,975 MW on a gross capacity basis and 1,337 MW on a net ownership basis. The remaining four projects, all in Ontario, are not operational, three due to revised contractual arrangements with the offtaker and the other, Tunis, has a forward-starting 15-year contractual agreement that will commence between November 2017 and June 2019. Eighteen of our projects are majority‑owned.
     The following charts show, based on generation capacity in MW, the diversification of our portfolio by segment and fuel type for our projects currently in operation:

     We sell the majority of the capacity and energy from our power generation projects under PPAs to a variety of utilities and other parties. Under the PPAs, which have expiration dates ranging from December 31, 2017 (the PPAs for our Kapuskasing and North Bay projects, which are not currently in operation) to December 31, 2037, we receive payments for electric energy sold to our customers (known as energy payments), in addition to payments for electric generation capacity (known as capacity payments). We also sell steam from a number of our projects to industrial purchasers under steam sales agreements. Sales of electricity are generally higher during the summer and winter months, when temperature extremes create demand for either summer cooling or winter heating.
     The majority of our natural gas, coal and biomass power generation projects have long‑term fuel supply agreements, typically accompanied by fuel transportation arrangements. In most cases, the term of the fuel supply and transportation arrangements correspond to the term of the relevant PPAs and many of the PPAs and steam sales agreements provide for the indexing or pass‑through of fuel costs to our customers. In cases where there is no pass‑through of fuel costs, we often attempt to mitigate the market price risk of changing commodity costs through the use of hedging strategies.
     We directly operate and maintain the majority of our power generation projects. We also partner with recognized leaders in the independent power industry to operate and maintain our other projects, including Colorado Energy Management (“CEM”) and Power Plant Management Services (“PPMS”). Under these operation, maintenance and management agreements, the operator is typically responsible for operations, maintenance and repair services.
     HISTORY OF OUR COMPANY
     Atlantic Power Corporation is a corporation continued under the laws of British Columbia, Canada, which was incorporated in 2004. We used the proceeds from our initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) in 

 
  4

 
November 2004 to acquire a 58% interest in Atlantic Power Holdings, LLC (now Atlantic Power Holdings, Inc., which we refer to herein as “Atlantic Holdings”) from two private equity funds managed by ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC (“ArcLight”) and from Caithness Energy, LLC (“Caithness”). Until December 31, 2009, we were externally managed under an agreement with Atlantic Power Management, LLC, an affiliate of ArcLight, when we agreed to pay ArcLight an aggregate of $15 million to terminate its management agreement with us. In connection with the termination of the management agreement, we hired all of the then‑current employees of Atlantic Power Management and entered into employment agreements with its three officers.
     At the time of our initial public offering, our publicly traded security was an Income Participating Security (“IPS”), which was comprised of one common share and a subordinated note. In November 2009, our shareholders approved a conversion from the IPS structure to a traditional common share structure in which each IPS was exchanged for one new common share and each old common share that did not form a part of an IPS was exchanged for approximately 0.44 of a new common share. Our common shares trade on the TSX under the symbol “ATP”. On July 23, 2010, we also began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “AT”.
     On November 5, 2011, we directly and indirectly acquired all of the issued and outstanding limited partnership units of Capital Power Income L.P., which was renamed Atlantic Power Limited Partnership on February 1, 2012 (the “Partnership”). The Partnership’s portfolio consisted of 19 wholly‑owned power generation assets located in both Canada and the United States, a 50.15% interest in a power generation asset in the state of Washington, and a 14.3% common ownership interest in Primary Energy Recycling Holdings, LLC which was later sold in 2012. At the acquisition date, the transaction increased the net generating capacity of our projects by 143% from 871 MW to approximately 2,116 MW.
    
On June 26, 2015, we sold our 100% ownership interest in Meadow Creek Project Company, LLC (“Meadow Creek”), 99% ownership in Canadian Hills Wind, LLC (“Canadian Hills”), 50% ownership interest in Rockland Wind Farm, LLC (“Rockland”), 27.6% ownership interest in Idaho Wind Partners 1, LLC (“Idaho Wind”) and 12.5% ownership interest in Goshen Phase II, LLC (“Goshen”) (collectively, the “Wind Projects”), totaling 521 MW net ownership to TerraForm AP Acquisition Holdings, LLC (“TerraForm”), an affiliate of SunEdison, Inc.
     OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY
     General
     Our business strategy is to increase the intrinsic value of the Company on a per-share basis through disciplined management of our balance sheet and our cost structure and investment of our discretionary cash in a combination of organic and external growth projects, acquisitions, and repurchases of our debt and equity securities. In evaluating these potential investments we are guided by the price-to-value relationship. With respect to organic growth, we have been making optimization investments in our existing projects that have produced cash returns higher than those currently available externally. We may undertake additional investments to repower certain facilities in conjunction with extensions of existing PPAs. We evaluate external growth opportunities on a regular basis, and have a highly disciplined and opportunistic approach. We will use discretionary cash for repurchases of our debt and equity securities only when the price-to-value level is compelling, with a goal of increasing intrinsic value per share while also improving the Company’s financial flexibility and strengthening its balance sheet. We use our depth of asset management experience to enhance the operating, contractual and financial performance of our current portfolio of projects. 
     In 2016, we successfully executed on several key initiatives. As a result of prior-year consolidation of our corporate operations to a single location, a continued focus on prudent cost cutting and reductions in our workforce, we lowered our corporate overhead expenses from $54 million in 2013 to $23 million in 2016. In April 2016, we refinanced our term Loan Facilities in order to provide greater financial flexibility, fund the repurchase and cancellation of our convertible debentures with near-term maturities and improve our debt maturity profile. We continued to amortize our corporate and project-level debt with approximately $97 million of principal payments and decreased our cash interest payments from $100 million in 2015 to $71 million in 2016. 
    
 
  5

 

 We have also made significant internal investments in order to increase intrinsic value per share. We invested approximately $25 million in our existing fleet in 2013 through 2016 and realized a cash return on these investments of approximately $7.8 million in 2016, which is expected to grow to approximately $12 million in 2017. In 2016, we purchased and cancelled approximately 8 million common shares at a cost of $19.5 million with our discretionary capital with a goal of capturing value arising from favorable price-to-value opportunities in the market. 
     Extending PPAs following their expiration
     PPAs in our portfolio have expiration dates ranging from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2037. We plan for PPA expirations by evaluating various options in the market. New arrangements may involve responses to utility solicitations for capacity and energy, direct negotiations with the original purchasing utility for PPA extensions, approaches by the projects to likely bilateral counterparties, including traditional PPAs, tolling agreements with creditworthy energy trading firms or the use of derivatives to lock in value. The current market for PPAs is challenging. When a PPA expires or is terminated, it is possible that the price received by the project for power under subsequent arrangements, if any, may be reduced and in some cases, significantly. Our projects may not be able to secure a new agreement and could be exposed to selling power at spot market prices. It is possible that subsequent PPAs or the spot markets may not be available at prices that permit the operation of the project on a profitable basis. For the status of description of some of our PPAs and related renegotiations, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risk Related to Our Business and Our Projects—The expiration or termination of our PPAs could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.” We do not assume that revenues or operating margins under existing PPAs will necessarily be sustained after PPA expirations, since most original PPAs included capacity payments related to return of and return on original capital invested, and counterparties or evolving regional electricity markets may or may not provide similar payments under new or extended PPAs.
     Organic growth
     We intend to look for opportunities to enhance the operational and financial performance of our projects through:
    
· | achievement of improved operating efficiencies, output, reliability and operation and maintenance costs through the upgrade or enhancement of existing equipment or plant configurations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | optimization of commercial arrangements such as PPAs, fuel supply and transportation contracts, steam sales agreements, operations and maintenance agreements and hedging arrangements; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | to the extent we have sufficient cash flow or are able to obtain financing, the expansion or redevelopment of existing projects, or development of new long-term contracted plants with industrial customers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Acquisition and investment strategy
     To the extent we pursue acquisitions, we intend to expand our operations by making accretive acquisitions with a focus on power generation facilities in the United States and Canada. We may also work with experienced development companies to acquire additional late stage development projects. There is also a very active secondary market for the purchase and sale of existing projects.
     Development and construction
     We have invested and may invest in the future in energy‑related projects primarily in the electric power industry, including investments in late stage development projects or companies where the prospects for creating long‑term cash flows are attractive. We may also to seek new plant opportunities with other industrial customers. We believe this approach makes sense based on the current structure of the power markets and it is a market segment that is within our core competencies.

 OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
     We have the following competitive strengths:
    
· | Diversified projects. Our power generation projects in operation have an aggregate gross electric generation capacity of approximately 1,975 MW, and our net ownership interest in these projects is approximately 1,337 MW. These projects are diversified by fuel type, electricity and steam customers, technologies, project operators and geography. The majority are located in California, the U.S. Mid‑Atlantic, New York and the province of British Columbia.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Experienced management team. Our management team has a depth of experience in commercial power operations and maintenance, project development, asset management, mergers and acquisitions, capital raising and financial controls.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Stability of project cash flow. Many of our power generation projects currently in operation have been in operation for more than ten years. Cash flows from each project are generally supported by PPAs with investment‑grade utilities and other creditworthy counterparties. We aim to stabilize operating margins through a combination of a project’s PPAs, fuel supply agreements and/or commodity hedges, when possible.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strong in‑house operations and asset management teams. We manage the operations of fourteen of our nineteen operating power generation projects, which represent 64% of our portfolio’s total generating capacity. The remaining five generation projects are operated by third parties, which are recognized leaders in the independent power business.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      ASSET MANAGEMENT
     Our asset management strategy is to manage our physical assets and commercial relationships to increase shareholder value. We proactively seek scale opportunities and to establish best practices that result in EBITDA and cash flow growth across all of our nineteen operating plants. Our asset management group works to ensure that our projects receive appropriate preventative and corrective maintenance and incur capital expenditures to provide for their safety, efficiency, availability, flexibility, longevity, and growth in EBITDA contribution. We also proactively look for opportunities to optimize power purchase, fuel supply, long‑term service and other agreements to deliver strong and predictable financial performance. The teams at each of the businesses have extensive experience in managing, operating and maintaining the assets.
     For operations and maintenance services at the five projects in our portfolio which we do not operate, we partner with experienced operators in the independent power business. Examples of our third‑party operators include CEM and PPMS, which are experienced, well regarded energy infrastructure management services companies. In addition, employees of Atlantic Power with significant experience managing similar assets are involved in all significant decisions with the objective of proactively identifying value‑creating opportunities such as contract renewals or restructurings, asset‑level refinancings, add‑on acquisitions, divestitures and participation at partnership meetings and calls.
     OUR ORGANIZATION AND SEGMENTS
     The following tables outline by segment our portfolio of power generating assets in operation as of February 28, 2017, including our interest in each facility. We believe our portfolio is well diversified in terms of electricity and steam buyers, fuel type, regulatory jurisdictions and regional power pools, thereby partially mitigating exposure to market, regulatory or environmental conditions specific to any single region.
     We have four reportable segments: East U.S., West U.S., Canada and Un‑Allocated Corporate. We revised our reportable business segments in the second quarter of 2015 as a result of significant asset sales and in order to align with changes in management’s structure, resource allocation and performance assessment in making decisions regarding our 

 
  7

 
operations. Our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2014 have been presented to reflect these changes in operating segments. These changes reflect our current operating focus. The segment classified as Un‑Allocated Corporate includes activities that support the executive and administrative offices, capital structure and costs of being a public registrant. These costs are not allocated to the operating segments when determining segment profit or loss.
     The sections below provide descriptions of our projects as they are aligned in our segment reporting structure for financial reporting purposes.
     See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for information on revenue from external customers, Project Adjusted EBITDA (a non‑GAAP measure), total assets by segment and revenue and total assets by geography.

      General
     Historically, the North American electricity industry was characterized by vertically integrated monopolies. During the late 1980s, several jurisdictions began a process of restructuring by moving away from vertically integrated monopolies toward more competitive market models. Rapid growth in electricity demand, environmental concerns, increasing electricity rates, technological advances and other concerns prompted government policies to encourage the supply of electricity from independent power producers. More recently, the North American electricity industry has become more diversified but faces the challenges of declining reserve margins and energy prices and uncertainty resulting from environmental regulations.
     According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s (“NERC”) 2016 Long‑Term Reliability Assessment (“LTRA”), published in January 2017, the 10-year forecast compound annual growth rate of the peak summer and winter electricity demand has trended downward to the lowest rates on record. The LTRA reference case shows a compound annual growth rate of 0.73% and 0.72% for the summer and winter seasons, respectively. This is a 

 
  10

 
decline from 0.99% and 0.92%, respectively, in the 2015 LTRA. The declining growth rates are expected to continue with the increase in energy efficiency and conservation programs as well as the continued growth of distributed solar and other storage sources.
     Despite low projected demand growth, reserve margins are trending down. According to the LTRA, the North American electric power system is undergoing a significant transformation with ongoing retirements of fossil-fired and nuclear capacity as well as growth in natural gas, wind, and solar resources. This shift is caused by several drivers, such as existing and proposed federal, state, and provincial environmental regulations as well as low natural gas prices, in addition to the ongoing integration of both distributed and utility-scale renewable resources. Natural gas-fired generation surpassed coal this year as the predominant fuel source for electric generation and is the leading fuel type for capacity additions.
     Non‑utility power generation 
     In the independent power generation sector, electricity is generated from a number of energy sources, including natural gas, coal, water, waste products such as biomass (e.g., wood, wood waste, agricultural waste), landfill gas, geothermal, solar and wind. Our 23 power generation projects are non‑utility electric generating facilities in the North American electrical power generation industry, 19 of which are currently in operation. The electric power industry is one of the largest industries in the United States, generating retail electricity sales of approximately $351 billion though November 2016, based on information published by the Energy Information Administration. A growing portion of the power produced in the United States and Canada is generated by non‑utility generators. According to the Energy Information Administration, independent power producers represented approximately 40% of total net generation in 2016. Independent power producers sell the electricity that they generate to electric utilities and other load‑serving entities (such as municipalities and electric cooperatives) by way of bilateral contracts or open power exchanges. The electric utilities and other load‑serving entities, in turn, generally sell this electricity to industrial, commercial and residential customers.
     Competition
     The power generation industry is characterized by intense competition, and we compete with utilities, industrial companies, yield companies and other independent power producers. Historically low crude and natural gas prices as well as decreased demand have contributed to reduced capacity and energy prices and increasing competition among generators to obtain power sales agreements. We also compete for acquisition and joint‑venture opportunities with numerous private equity, infrastructure and pension funds, Canadian and U.S. independent power firms, utility non‑regulated subsidiaries and other strategic and financial players.

     Our facilities and operations are subject to laws and regulations that govern, among other things, transactions by and with purchasers of power, including utility companies, the development and construction of generation facilities, the ownership and operations of generation facilities, access to transmission, and the geographical location, zoning, land use and operation aspects of our facilities and properties, including environmental matters.
     In the United States, the power generation and sale aspects of our projects are primarily regulated by the Federal Energy Regulation Commission (“FERC”), although most of our projects benefit from the special provisions accorded to Qualifying Facilities (“QFs”) or Exempt Wholesale Generators (“EWGs”).
     In Canada, electricity generation is subject primarily to provincial regulation. Our projects in British Columbia are therefore subject to different regulatory regimes from our projects in Ontario.

     Generating projects
 United States
 Thirteen of our power generating projects are QFs under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended (“PURPA”), and FERC regulations. A QF falls into one or both of two primary classes, both of which would facilitate one of PURPA’s goals to more efficiently use fossil fuels to generate electricity than typical utility plants. The first class of QFs includes energy producers that generate power using renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, biomass or waste fuels. The second class of QFs includes cogeneration facilities, which must meet specific fossil fuel efficiency requirements by producing both electricity and steam versus electricity only.
     The generating projects with QF status and which are currently party to a PPA with a utility or have been granted authority to charge market-based rates or are exempt from FERC rate-making authority. The FERC has granted eight of the projects the authority to charge market-based rates based primarily on a finding that the projects lack market power. The projects with QF status are also exempt from state regulation respecting the rates of electric utilities and the financial or organizational regulation of electric utilities. However, state regulators may review the prudency of utilities entering into PPAs with QFs and the siting of the generation facilities. The majority of our generation is sold by QFs under PPAs that required approval by state authorities.
     PURPA, as initially implemented by the FERC, generally required that vertically integrated electric utilities purchase power from QFs at their avoided costs. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EP Act of 2005”), however, established new limits on PURPA’s requirement that electric utilities buy electricity from QFs to certain markets that lack competitive characteristics. The projects with EWG status are also exempt from state regulation respecting the rates of electric utilities.
     Notwithstanding their status as QFs and EWGs, our projects remain subject to various aspects of FERC regulation, including those relating to power marketer status and to oversight of mergers, acquisitions and investments relating to utilities under the Federal Power Act, as amended by the EP Act of 2005. All of our projects are also subject to reliability standards developed and enforced by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (“NERC”). NERC is a not-for-profit regulatory authority whose mission is to assure the reliability and security of the bulk power system in North America.
     Pursuant to its authority, NERC has issued, and the FERC has approved, a series of mandatory reliability standards. Users, owners and operators of the bulk power system can be penalized significantly for failing to comply with the FERC-approved reliability standards. We have designated our Manager of Operational and Regulatory Compliance to oversee compliance with reliability standards and an outside law firm specializing in this area advises us on FERC and NERC compliance, including annual compliance training for relevant employees.
     British Columbia, Canada
     The vast majority of British Columbia’s power is generated or procured by BC Hydro. BC Hydro is one of the largest electric utilities in Canada. BC Hydro is owned by the Province of British Columbia and is regulated by the British Columbia Utilities Commission (the “BCUC”), which is governed by the Utilities Commission Act (British Columbia) and is responsible for the regulation of British Columbia’s public energy utilities including publicly owned and investor-owned utilities (i.e., independent power producers).
     BC Hydro is generally required to acquire all new power (beyond what it already generates from existing BC Hydro plants) from independent power producers.
     All contracts for electricity supply, including those between independent power producers and BC Hydro, must be filed with and approved by the BCUC as being “in the public interest”. The BCUC may hold a hearing in this regard. Furthermore, the BCUC may make rules governing conditions to be contained in agreements entered into by public utilities for electricity.

 The BCUC has adopted the standards developed by NERC as being applicable to, among others, all generators of electricity in British Columbia, including independent power producers. In addition, the BCUC has adopted a number of other standards, including the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (“WECC”) standards. As a practical matter, WECC typically administers standards compliance on the BCUC’s behalf.
     The Clean Energy Act (the “Clean Energy Act”), which became law in 2010, sets out British Columbia’s energy objectives. This Act states, among other things, that British Columbia aims to accelerate and expand the development of clean and renewable energy sources in British Columbia to, among other things, promote economic development and job creation and continue to work toward the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation also explicitly states that British Columbia will encourage the use of waste heat, biogas and biomass to reduce waste. The Government of British Columbia released in April 2016 the Clean Energy Production in B.C.: An inter-Agency Guidebook for Project Development, which is consistent with the Clean Energy Act and favors clean and renewable energy sources such as waterpower, windpower and ocean energy generation. BC Hydro is required to meet these objectives and submit reports to the BCUC updating on its progress.
     Other provincial regulators in British Columbia having authority over independent power producers include the British Columbia Safety Authority, the Ministry of Environment and the Integrated Land Management Bureau.
     Ontario, Canada
     In Ontario, the Ontario Energy Board (“OEB”) is an administrative tribunal with overall responsibility for the regulation and supervision of the natural gas and electricity industries in Ontario and with the authority to grant or renew, and set the terms for, licenses with respect to electricity generation facilities, including our projects.
     No person is permitted to own or operate large or medium-scale electricity generation facilities in Ontario without a license from the OEB.
     The OEB’s general functions include:
    
· | Determination of the rates charged for regulated services in the electricity sector;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Licensing of market participants;
--+----------------------------------


· | Inspections, particularly with respect to compelling production of records and information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Market monitoring and reporting, including on anti-competitive practice;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Consumer advocacy; and
--+-----------------------


· | Enforcement and compliance.
--+----------------------------

  The OEB has the authority effectively to modify licenses by adopting “codes” that are deemed to form part of the licenses. Furthermore, any violations of the license or other irregularities in the relationship with the OEB can result in fines. While the OEB provides reports to the Ontario Minister of Energy, it generally operates independently from the government. However, the Minister may issue policy directives (with Cabinet approval) concerning general policy and the objectives to be pursued by the OEB, and the OEB is required to implement such policy directives.
     A number of other regulators and quasi-governmental entities play a role in electricity regulation in Ontario, including the IESO, Hydro One, the Electrical Safety Authority (“ESA”) and OEFC.
     The IESO is responsible for administering the wholesale electricity market and controlling Ontario’s transmission grid. The IESO is a non-profit corporation whose directors are appointed by the government of Ontario. The IESO’s “Market Rules” form the regulatory framework for the operation of Ontario’s transmission grid and electricity market. The Market Rules require, among other things, that generators meet certain equipment and 

 
  13

 
performance standards and certain system reliability obligations. The IESO may enforce the Market Rules by imposing financial penalties. The IESO may also terminate, suspend or restrict participatory rights.
     In November 2006, the IESO entered into a memorandum of understanding with NERC, in which it recognized NERC as the “electricity reliability organization” in Ontario. In addition, the IESO has also entered into a similar MOU with both the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (the “NPCC”) and NERC. IESO is accountable to NERC and NPCC for compliance with NERC and NPCC reliability standards. While IESO may impose Ontario-specific reliability standards, such standards must be consistent with, and at least as stringent as, NERC’s and NPCC’s standards. Effective July 1, 2016, the IESO is changing the definition of what generating facilities are considered part of the Bulk Electric System (“BES”). Any new facility grouped into the BES, which includes all Ontario sites except Kapuskasing, will have to comply with all NERC reliability standards in effect in Ontario.
     As of January 1, 2015, the IESO is responsible for procuring new electricity generation. As a result, the IESO enters into electricity generation contracts with electricity generators in Ontario from time to time. Although we are not presently party to any such contracts, we may seek to enter into such contracts if and when the opportunity arises.
     In 1998, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario passed the Energy Competition Act of 1998, which authorized the establishment of a market in electricity, and reorganized Ontario Hydro into five companies: Ontario Power Generation (“OPG”), the Ontario Hydro Services Company (later renamed Hydro One), the Independent Electricity Market Operator (later renamed the Independent Electricity System Operator, or “IESO”), the ESA, and OEFC. The two commercial companies, Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One, were intended to eventually operate as private businesses rather than as crown corporations. In the fall of 2015, the Province sold off 15% of Hydro One in an IPO and plans to sell up to 60% in the future year.
     The Green Energy Act became law in Ontario in 2009 for renewable electricity generation technologies, including via a feed-in tariff program. This Act states that the Government of Ontario is, among other things, committed to fostering the growth of renewable energy projects, to removing barriers to and promoting opportunities for renewable energy projects and to promoting a green economy. From 2009 to 2013, power purchase contracts in respect of large-scale energy projects were awarded under a feed-in-tariff program. The Government of Ontario has announced that going forward, power purchase contracts for large-scale projects will be awarded through a request for qualifications (RFQ)/request for proposals (RFP) process. 
     Carbon emissions
 In the United States, during the past several years government action addressing carbon emissions has been focused on the regional and state level. Beginning in 2009, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (“RGGI”) was established by certain Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states as the first cap-and-trade program in the United States for CO2 emissions. CO2 allowances are now a tradable commodity in the RGGI states. The nine states currently participating in RGGI have varied implementation plans and schedules. In February 2013, RGGI released an updated model rule that reduced the regional CO2 budget beginning in 2014, with further reductions each year from 2015 to 2020. The one RGGI state where we have project interests, New York, also provides cost mitigation for independent power projects with certain types of power contracts. California’s cap-and-trade program governing greenhouse gas emissions became effective for the electricity sector on January 1, 2013. California, along with British Columbia and Quebec, is part of the Western Climate Initiative, which supports the implementation of state and provincial greenhouse gas emissions trading programs. Other states and regions in the United States have considered similar regulations, and it is possible that federal climate legislation will be established in the future.
     In 2006, the State of California passed legislation initiating two programs to control/reduce the creation of greenhouse gases. The two laws are more commonly known as AB 32 and SB 1368. Under AB 32 (the Global Warming Solutions Act), the California Air Resources Board (the “CARB”) is required to adopt a greenhouse gas emissions cap on all major sources (not limited to the electric sector) to reduce state wide emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2020. Under the CARB regulations that took effect on January 1, 2013, electricity generators and certain other facilities are now subject to an allowance for greenhouse gas emissions, with allowances allocated by both formulas set by the CARB and auctions.

     SB 1368 added the requirement that the California Energy Commission, in consultation with the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) and the CARB, establish greenhouse gas emission performance standards and implement regulations for PPAs for a term of five or more years entered into prospectively by publicly owned electric utilities. The legislation directs the California Energy Commission to establish the performance standard as one not exceeding the rate of greenhouse gas emitted per megawatt hour (“MWh”) associated with combined-cycle, gas turbine baseload generation, such as our North Island project.
     The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has taken several recent actions respecting CO2 emissions. The EPA’s actions include its December 2009 finding of “endangerment” to public health and welfare from greenhouse gases, its issuance in September 2009 of the Final Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule which required large sources, including power plants, to monitor and report greenhouse gas emissions to the EPA annually, which was required beginning in 2011, and its issuance in May 2010 of its final Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, which under a phased-in approach requires large industrial facilities, including power plants, to obtain permits to emit, and to use best available control technology to curb emissions of, greenhouse gases. In addition, in August 2015, the EPA issued its final rule regulating carbon emissions from existing electric generating units, which is referred to as the Clean Power Plan. Implementation of the Clean Power Plan (emission reductions for existing coal and natural gas-fired power plants would be implemented by the states, or by the EPA in any states that fail to act by specified deadlines) was scheduled to begin in September 2016. However, on February 9, 2016, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the EPA could not begin implementation of the Clean Power Plan while the rule is being challenged by 29 states and various corporations and industry groups in the United States Courts of Appeals for the District of Columbia. A Court of Appeals decision is likely in the first half of 2017, after which it is likely that the case will be considered by the Supreme Court. While President Trump has indicated an interest in revoking Obama era climate regulations, it remains unclear at this time if the new U.S. presidential administration will implement, modify or repeal the regulations described above.
     In Canada, the federal government and the provincial governments of British Columbia and Ontario have implemented greenhouse gas reporting regulations and are developing additional programs to address greenhouse gas emissions. Under the 2004 federal Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Program (“GHGRP”), all facilities which emit 50,000 tonnes or more of CO2eq per year are required to submit reports on their emissions to Environment Canada.
     On October 3, 2016, the Government of Canada announced its proposed pan-Canadian approach for the pricing of carbon pollution, under which all Canadian jurisdictions are to have carbon pricing in place by 2018. Under the federal approach, the provinces and territories can put a direct price on carbon pollution or they can adopt a cap-and-trade system. While the direct price on carbon pollution has been stated by the federal government to begin at a minimum of $10 per tonne in 2018 and rise by $10 a year to reach $50 per tonne in 2022, the details remain to be determined. The requirements for provinces and territories choosing a cap-and-trade system also remain to be determined; however, it seems likely that the existing cap-and-trade program in Ontario will satisfy the federal requirements.
     The Government of British Columbia has enacted a number of significant pieces of climate action legislation that frame British Columbia’s approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions with the goal of supporting its participation in the emerging low-carbon economy.
     One key piece of legislation is the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets Act (“GGRTA”), which came into force in 2008 and sets legislated targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in British Columbia. Using 2007 as a base year, GGRTA (along with related Ministerial Orders) requires that emissions must be reduced by a minimum of 18% by 2016, 33% by 2020 and 80% by 2050. Also required in connection with GGRTA are (from 2010 onward) British Columbia Greenhouse Gas Inventory Reports (reports are prepared in even-numbered years and tables are updated in odd-numbered years), Community Energy and Emissions Inventory Reports (prepared every two years) and Carbon Neutral Action Reports (prepared annually), all of which are designed to provide scientific, comparable and consistent reporting of greenhouse gas sources.

 Other related, key pieces of legislation include the Carbon Tax Act (“CTA”) and the Greenhouse Gas Industrial Reporting and Control Act (“GGIRCA”). CTA operates to put a price on greenhouse gas emissions, providing an incentive for sustainable choices and practices by producers of greenhouse gases. GGIRCA came into force on January 1, 2016 and combined several pieces of British Columbia's existing greenhouse gas legislation into a single legislative framework. It includes the ability to set a greenhouse gas emissions intensity benchmark for regulated industries and enables the benchmark to be met through flexible options, such as purchasing offsets or paying a set price per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions that would be dedicated to a technology fund. Three regulations necessary to implement GGIRCA also came into force on January 1, 2016: the Greenhouse Gas Emission Reporting Regulation (“GGERR”), the Greenhouse Gas Emission Administrative Penalties and Appeals Regulation (“GGEAPAR”) and the Greenhouse Gas Emission Control Regulation (“GGECR”). GGERR establishes compliance reporting requirements and ensures that industrial operations that emit more than 10,000 carbon dioxide equivalent tonnes per year report their greenhouse gas pollution each year. GGEAPAR establishes the process for when, how much, and under what conditions administrative penalties may be levied for non-compliance with GGIRCA or the regulations made under GGIRCA. GGECR establishes the BC Carbon Registry and sets criteria for developing emission offsets issued by the provincial government. GGECR also establishes the price for funded units issued under GGIRCA that would go towards a technology fund. Regulated operations will purchase offsets from the market or funded units from government to meet emission limits. Funded unit revenue that goes to a technology fund will also support the development of clean technologies with significant potential to reduce British Columbia's emissions over the long term.
     Ontario has a new Quantification, Reporting, and Verification of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Regulation O. Reg. 143/16 under the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, 2016 (the “Ontario Cap and Trade Act”) which applies after January 1, 2017. Ontario’s reporting rules require a report for all facilities which release 10,000 Tonnes CO2eq or more per year to be made using Environment Canada’s Single Window System. For 2014 (the last year for which emission reports had been published at the beginning of 2017), each of the four natural gas powered generating facilities in Ontario reported emissions in excess of 90,000 Tonnes of CO2eq (over 450,000 Tonnes of CO2eq in total) on the federal registry.
     In December 2015, Ontario, Manitoba and Quebec signed a Memorandum of Understanding signaling their intentions to share information and link their cap-and-trade programs, which effort is expected to strengthen and expand the coverage of the Western Climate Initiative.
     In Ontario, facilities with annual GHG emissions of 25,000 tonnes or more are generally required by law to participate in the Ontario cap-and-trade regime. However, under The Cap and Trade Program Regulation O. Reg. 144/16 (the “Cap and Trade Program”), facilities which primarily generate electricity using natural gas from a local distributor are excluded from the mandatory registration requirements under the Ontario Cap and Trade Act and participate in the Ontario Cap and Trade Program through the payment of the carbon price charged by the local natural gas distributor on natural gas delivered after the end of 2016. While the details of arrangements for the recovery of these additional costs had not yet been fully settled at the beginning of 2017, the IESO has stated generally that “the electricity sector will see the cost of carbon reflected in the wholesale electricity price when natural gas-fired resources are on the margin” and it is generally expected that most, if not all, of the incremental carbon price paid by generators to local natural gas distributors will be recoverable by the generators under the applicable PPAs, which will have the effect of making electricity generated from natural gas increasingly incrementally expensive over time.
     Additionally, more than half of the U.S. states and most Canadian provinces have set mandates requiring the achievement of certain levels of renewable energy production and/or energy efficiency during target timeframes. This includes generation from wind, solar and biomass, and/or renewable fuel mandates. For example, in 2011, California enacted a law requiring retail sellers of electricity to deliver 33% of their customers' electricity requirements from renewable resources, as defined in the statute, by 2020. Additionally, in 2015, California enacted SB 350, which increases the amount of electricity from renewable resources that California retail sellers must deliver after 2020 to 40% of retail sales by December 2024, 45% of retail sales by December 2027, and 50% of retail sales by December 2030. In order to meet CO2 reduction goals, changes in the generation fuel mix are forecasted to include a reduction in existing coal resources, higher reliance on natural gas and renewable energy resources and an increase in demand-side resources. Investments in new or upgraded transmission lines will be required to move increasing renewable generation from more remote locations to load centers.

     In December 2015, 195 countries participating in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“UNFCC”), at its 21st Conference of the Parties meeting (“COP21”) held in Paris, adopted a new global agreement on the reduction of climate change (the “Paris Agreement”). The Paris Agreement became effective in November 2016, after it had been ratified by a sufficient number of countries. The Paris Agreement sets a goal of holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius and pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius, to be achieved by aiming to reach a global peaking of GHG emissions as soon as possible. The Paris Agreement consists of two elements: a legally binding commitment by each participating country to set an emissions reduction target, referred to as “nationally determined contributions” or “NDCs”, with a review of the NDCs that could lead to updates and enhancements every five years beginning in 2023 (Article 4) and a transparency commitment requiring a participating countries to disclose in full their progress (Article 13). 
     Both Canada and the United States have ratified the Paris Agreement, and it may result in additional regulations to reduce carbon emissions in coming years. The NDC submitted by Canada included a 2030 target of 30% below 2005 levels, and the NDC submitted by the United States calls for reducing its net GHG emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025. President Trump stated during the presidential campaign that he would withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, but it remains unclear whether this will occur.
