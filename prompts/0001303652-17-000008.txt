ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Our mission is to help people see and understand data.
Our software products put the power of data into the hands of everyday people, allowing a broad population of business users to engage with their data, ask questions, solve problems and create value.
Based on innovative core technologies originally developed at Stanford University, our products dramatically reduce the complexity, inflexibility and expense associated with traditional business intelligence applications. We aim to make our products easy to use, ubiquitous and as deeply-rooted in the workplace as spreadsheets are today.
Our software is designed for anyone with data and questions. We are democratizing the use of business analytics software by allowing people to access information, perform analysis and share results without assistance from technical specialists. By putting powerful, self-service analytical technology directly into the hands of people who make decisions with data, we seek to accelerate the pace of informed and intelligent decision-making. We believe this enables our customers to create better workplaces, with happier employees who are empowered to more fully express their ingenuity and creativity.
Our products are used by people of diverse skill levels across all kinds of organizations, including Fortune 500 corporations, small and medium-sized businesses, government agencies, universities, research institutions and non-profits. Organizations employ our products in a broad range of use cases such as increasing sales, streamlining operations, improving customer service, managing investments, assessing quality and safety, studying and treating diseases, completing academic research, addressing environmental problems and improving education. Our products are flexible and capable enough to help a single user on a laptop analyze data from a simple spreadsheet, or to enable thousands of users across an enterprise to execute complex queries against massive databases.

Underpinning our innovative products is a set of technology advances that spans the domains of sophisticated computer graphics, human-computer interaction and high performance database systems. These technology innovations include VizQL and our Hybrid Data Architecture: 

• | VizQL—Our breakthrough visual query language, VizQL, translates drag-and-drop actions into data queries and then expresses that information visually. VizQL unifies the formerly disparate tasks of query and visualization and allows users to transform questions into pictures without the need for software scripts, chart wizards or dialogue boxes that inhibit speed and flexibility. This capability is designed to enable a more intuitive, creative and engaging experience for our users. VizQL can deliver dramatic gains in people's ability to see and understand data, and we believe it represents a foundational advancement in the field of analytics.


• | Hybrid Data Architecture—Our Hybrid Data Architecture combines the power and flexibility of our Live Query and In-Memory Data Engines. Our Live Query Engine allows users to instantaneously connect to large volumes of data in its existing format and location, reducing the need for time-consuming data transformation processes that only technical specialists can perform. In addition, this capability allows customers to leverage investments in their existing data platforms and to capitalize on the capabilities of high performance databases. Our In-Memory Data Engine enables users to import large amounts of data into our own in-memory database. Using advanced algorithms and data compression techniques, our in-memory technology facilitates quick query responses on up to hundreds of millions of rows of data. Our Hybrid Data Architecture enables these data engines to work in harmony, allowing users the flexibility to access and analyze data from diverse sources and locations, while optimizing speed and performance for each source.

Our distribution strategy is based on a land and expand business model and is designed to capitalize on the ease of use, low up-front cost and collaborative capabilities of our software. Our products tend to be adopted at a grassroots level within organizations, often beginning with a free trial, and then spread across departments, divisions and geographies via word-of-mouth and the discovery of new use cases. Over time, many of our customers find that the use of our products expands to a broad cross-section of their organizations and that our deployments and use cases become significantly more strategic in nature. Accordingly, we have developed enterprise-class product and service capabilities that allow us to both complement and supplant core, legacy business intelligence deployments.
As of December 31, 2016, we had more than 54,000 customer accounts across a broad array of company sizes and industries. Some of our largest customers include Verizon, Capital One, Cisco, Deloitte and various U.S. Government Agencies. In addition, we have cultivated strong relationships with technology partners to help us extend the reach of our products. These partners include both traditional database vendors such as International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation and Teradata Corporation and emerging database vendors such as Amazon.com, Inc., Cloudera, Inc., Google Inc., Pivotal Greenplum Database ("Pivotal GPDB") and Vertica (a division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise).
We have been growing in recent periods. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our total revenues were $826.9 million, $653.6 million and $412.6 million, respectively. We had net losses of $144.4 million and $83.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively and net income of $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. We have generated positive cash flow from operating activities of $175.0 million, $136.8 million and $89.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We believe our land and expand business model provides financial visibility as aggregate revenues from subsequent sales of products and maintenance services to our customers have typically been multiples of the revenues we realized from those customers' initial purchases.
Growth Strategy
Our mission to help people see and understand data presents a broad market opportunity. We intend to continue to invest in a number of growth initiatives to allow us to pursue our mission. Our strategies for growth include:

• | Expand our customer base—We operate in a rapidly growing analytics and business intelligence software market. We believe that Tableau is well positioned in the market to expand our present customer base of over 54,000 customer accounts. We are expanding our online and offline marketing efforts to increase our brand awareness. We are also making investments in growing both our direct sales teams and indirect sales channels.

• | Further penetrate our existing customer base—Leveraging our land and expand business model, we intend to continue to increase adoption of our products within and across our existing customer base, as they expand the number of users and develop new use cases for our products in the enterprise. We believe there is an opportunity to extend the reach of our products within our customer base. Our sales and marketing strategy and focus on customer success help our customers identify and pursue new use cases within their organizations. As this expansion occurs, we believe that our products will also increasingly supplant incumbent legacy platforms to become the standard platform for analytics and business intelligence for our customers.


• | Grow internationally—With approximately 29% of our total revenues generated outside the United States and Canada in the year ended December 31, 2016, we believe there is significant opportunity to grow our international business. Our products currently support eight languages, and we are expanding our direct sales force and indirect sales channels outside the United States. We have international operations in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom, and we intend to invest in further expanding our footprint in these and other regions.


• | Relentlessly innovate and advance our products—We have sought to rapidly improve the capabilities of our products over time and intend to continue to invest in product innovation and leadership. Building on our foundational technology innovations, including VizQL, we have released ten major versions of our software to date, rapidly expanding and improving our feature set and capabilities. Our most recent major release, Tableau 10, delivers new design and analytical innovations that make interacting with data on the web, on mobile or in the enterprise faster and easier. Additional capabilities include cross-database joins to bring together disparate data sources, advanced analytics improvements like drag and drop clustering, a device designer for mobile responsive dashboards design and support for additional data sources. Since the release of Tableau 10, we released Tableau 10.1 which includes more ways to connect and prep data, improved formatting, new visual analytics features and new Tableau Server features. We plan to continue to invest in research and development, including hiring top technical talent, focusing on core technology innovation and maintaining an agile organization that supports rapid release cycles. In particular, we intend to focus on further developing our cloud capabilities, offering faster data analysis, continuing to enhance our self-service platform and making data preparation easier.


• | Extend our distribution channels and partner ecosystem—We plan to continue investing in distribution channels, technology partners, and other strategic relationships to help us enter and grow in new markets while complementing our direct sales efforts. We are actively growing our indirect channels, particularly in international markets. Our most important technology partnerships are with market-leading database vendors, such as IBM, Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation and Teradata Corporation, and emerging database vendors, such as Amazon.com, Inc., Cloudera, Inc., Google Inc., Pivotal GPDB and Vertica, with which we have collaborated to develop high performance and optimized connectivity to a broad group of popular data stores. We intend to continue to invest in partnerships that enable us to build and promote complementary capabilities that benefit our customers. We also offer application program interfaces ("APIs") to further empower our developer and OEM partner ecosystem to create applications that embed Tableau functionality.


• | Foster our passionate user community—We benefit from a vibrant and engaged user community. We are investing in initiatives to further expand and energize this group, both online, through our online community site and through events such as our annual customer conferences, including our U.S. Tableau Customer Conference which was attended by a record 13,000 customers and partners in 2016.


• | Treasure and cultivate our exceptional culture—We believe our culture is a core ingredient of our success. Our employees share a passion for our mission, and our mission stands at the top of a list of eight core cultural values that govern our approach to our business. Our other core values include: teamwork; product leadership; using our own products; respect; honesty; simplicity; and commitment to delighting customers. Our values permeate our organization and drive our identity as a company. For example, we strive to paint virtually all aspects of our business with a brush of simplicity, including product user interfaces, pricing models, business processes and marketing strategies. Our culture is consistently cited in employee surveys as a key reason for their satisfaction with Tableau, and we have been publicly recognized as one of the best workplaces in the State of Washington.

Products
Our products help people see and understand data. They offer the power and flexibility required to serve a broad range of use cases, from answering questions with small spreadsheets to completing enterprise business intelligence projects involving massive volumes of data. We currently offer five key products: Tableau Desktop, a self-service, powerful analytics product for anyone with data; Tableau Server, a business intelligence platform for organizations; Tableau Online, a hosted software-as-a-service ("SaaS") version of Tableau Server; Tableau Public, a free cloud-based platform for analyzing and sharing public data; and Vizable, a free application used to easily analyze data on a tablet. 
Tableau Desktop
Tableau Desktop helps knowledge workers make sense of the many kinds of data they encounter every day. The defining capability of Tableau Desktop is the interactive experience it provides for exploring and analyzing data. By fundamentally integrating data analysis and visualization, our products provide a visual window into data trapped in spreadsheets and databases, fostering greater engagement with data and allowing people to better answer questions, develop insights and solve problems. The result is a self-service analytics environment that empowers people to access and analyze data independently and at a rapid pace.
Tableau Desktop's key capabilities include:

• | Visual analytics—Tableau Desktop empowers people to ask sophisticated questions by composing drag-and-drop pictures of their data. Tableau Desktop's easy-to-use interface is built on VizQL, which is capable of describing thousands of easily understood visual presentations of data including tables, maps, time series, dashboards and tables of graphs. The combination of a sophisticated language with a simple user interface means users can explore many different perspectives of their data. We believe being able to quickly view data from different perspectives inspires creative thinking and helps people find the right view to answer a question.


• | Analytical depth—An important aspect of Tableau Desktop is its ability to marry powerful visualization with deep analytics. Users can filter and sort their data, create sophisticated calculations, drill into underlying information, define sets and cohorts, perform statistical analysis and derive correlations between diverse data sets with agility and relative ease. For example, with a few clicks, users can generate sophisticated forecasting models. This combination of simplicity and usefulness, ease of use and analytical depth, is what makes it possible for Tableau Desktop to empower a whole new group of people to become data analysts.


• | Data access—Tableau Desktop lets people access and query a large number of common data sources, from traditional database systems like Oracle Corporation and SQL Server, to innovative new data stores like SAP HANA and Amazon Redshift, to Web applications like Salesforce and Google Analytics, to spreadsheets and files, to newly emerging data sources like Hadoop and NoSQL databases. Users can connect to these data sources with a few clicks, without any scripting or programming.


• | Live query—Tableau Desktop translates users' interactions into live queries. As people use the drag-and-drop interface to examine information, they are automatically generating sophisticated queries against their database. Tableau Desktop can generate queries in a range of query languages including Structured Query Language ("SQL"), Multidimensional Expressions ("MDX"), and Salesforce Object Query Language ("SOQL"). Each query is optimized for the target platform and its unique performance and analytical characteristics. This live query approach allows customers to leverage their investments in database infrastructure and enables them to take advantage of query-optimized databases.


• | In-memory query—Tableau Desktop contains an In-Memory Data Engine that can be used for rapid analysis. Many business users have data that is not stored in a database, and many databases are not set up to support interactive and analytical queries. In these cases, users can import the data into Tableau Desktop's In-Memory Data Engine. This data engine is designed to support analytical queries on hundreds of millions of rows of data with responses rendered in seconds.


• | Data integration—Many questions require combining data from multiple sources. Tableau Desktop provides a number of ways for people to combine data without requiring a typical data loading and transformation project. A Tableau workbook can connect to many different data sources, with each source independently leveraging either a live query or in-memory approach. Users can then combine the data in a single dashboard, visualization, filter or calculation using our data blending functionality. This approach can greatly extend the scope and depth of questions a person can answer.

 7


• | Sharing and presentation—Tableau Desktop allows users to author and distribute visualizations and dashboards with the ease expected of everyday office tools like spreadsheets. Content created in Tableau Desktop can be embedded in documents and presentations, or the workbooks can be distributed for viewing by people who have Tableau Desktop or Tableau Reader, a free product to view and interact with visualizations built in Tableau Desktop. Alternately, users can publish their workbooks to Tableau Server or Tableau Online enabling others in the organization to access them using a Web browser or a mobile device.

Tableau Server
Tableau Server is a powerful business intelligence platform with enterprise-class data management and scalability. The collaborative features of Tableau Server are designed to foster more sharing of analytics to improve the dissemination of information across an organization and promote improved decision-making.
Tableau Server's key capabilities include:

• | Shared content—Tableau Server provides an easy-to-navigate repository of shared visualizations and dashboards within an organization. After users of Tableau Desktop create and publish their work to Tableau Server, any other user with appropriate credentials can view and interact with it using a Web browser or mobile device. These viewers can also edit the work and republish it back to the server. The ability to publish dashboards and easily share impactful visual analysis increases awareness of business data and promotes improved decision-making. In addition, allowing others to interact with an analysis gives them deeper understanding of the information which leads to an improved grasp on the problem and hence greater confidence in the solution.


• | Shared data—Just as Tableau Server is a platform for shared analysis, it is also a platform for shared data. Organizations can use Tableau Server to centrally manage enterprise data sources and metadata enabling knowledge sharing, efficiency, governance and data consistency. Business users or IT professionals can create rich data models, containing calculations, hierarchies, field aliases, sets and groups of interest, and publish them to Tableau Server to be shared across an organization. Others can use these models as a starting point for analysis while extending them to meet their own specific analytical needs. While centralized data models are not a pre-requisite for analysis in Tableau, they provide flexibility and increased productivity while maintaining control and security of data.


• | Universal access—We have designed Tableau Server to enable seamless sharing of content across desktop, mobile and Web clients. Once users author and publish analytical content to the server, people across an organization can consume it on different browsers and devices. Further, Tableau Server automatically detects the device being used and adapts the content to take advantage of the device's capabilities including native touch experience and form factor. Tableau Server allows users to actively subscribe to content for automatic delivery on their devices or pull content on demand.


• | Integration—Tableau Server offers APIs that help developers, customers and partners embed and control our software from portals, websites and other enterprise applications. Our APIs can also be used to construct in-memory databases, upload content and add users to the server programmatically. In addition to APIs, we also offer command line utilities to automate management tasks, and data upload tools to move data rapidly into Tableau Server.


• | Scalability—Tableau Server's distributed multi-tier architecture allows it to scale to tens of thousands of users, across desktop, Web and mobile clients, meeting the needs of some of the largest organizations globally.


• | Security—Tableau Server provides a security model that encompasses authentication, data and network security. Tableau Server is also built on a multi-tenant architecture that allows administrators to logically partition a single system across user populations, providing for separation of content.


• | Administration—We believe the ease of administering a system is tremendously important to its adoption. While Tableau Server's management interface is designed to be simple enough for a line-of-business user, we also provide APIs to allow administrators to automate routine management processes. After the initial setup, many of our customers have reported that they spend little time on Tableau Server administration.

Tableau Online
Tableau Online, a hosted SaaS version of Tableau Server, is built on the Tableau Server platform and provides ease of use, speed and availability without requiring customers to manage physical infrastructure. Tableau Online runs in a secure data center and can be accessed by clients remotely using Tableau Desktop, a browser or a mobile device.
In addition to offering the same capabilities as Tableau Server, Tableau Online's key capabilities include:

• | Hybrid data connectivity—Tableau Online supports both live connectivity and in-memory extracts of cloud databases including Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery and Microsoft SQL Azure. Users can access real-time data from cloud data sources without requiring data snapshots.


• | On-premises data sync—Tableau Online provides easy synching of on-premises data such as Microsoft Excel and Oracle to the cloud. This enables customers to keep their data fresh without compromising enterprise security.


• | Always up-to-date—Tableau Online is always running the latest maintenance releases and versions of Tableau Server. Customers do not need to worry about upgrading their infrastructure or deploying the latest patches.


• | Reliable, scalable and secure—Tableau Online is a SaaS analytics application built on the same enterprise-class architecture of Tableau Server.

Tableau Public
Tableau Public is a free cloud-based offering that is available for anyone to use with public data. This offering allows users of diverse backgrounds, from bloggers and journalists to researchers to government workers, to easily visualize public data on their websites. People who visit these websites can interact with the visualizations and share them via social media.
Using Tableau Public, data can be transformed into interactive graphs, dashboards and maps for the world to see on the Web. For example, a blogger focused on economic issues may want to blog about changes in the U.S. unemployment rate. Using Tableau Public, the blogger can quickly build an interactive visualization using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and embed it in his blog. Every time the blog is viewed, Tableau Public serves up the data as a dynamic visualization.
Tableau Public enables us to test new product features and engage in user research as well as generate greater awareness of Tableau and increase community engagement. In addition to offering most of the features of Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server, Tableau Public offers the following capabilities:

• | Web scale—Tableau Public meets the massive performance requirements of serving dynamic content on top tier websites including media channels, social media and other consumer internet services. Through a combination of proprietary software and optimized hardware we have designed a highly scalable, multi-tenant, online infrastructure that is based at a secure third party Web hosting facility. Our Tableau Public service has reached over 1 billion cumulative views worldwide.


• | Social reach—Anyone viewing or interacting with a Tableau Public visualization can share it on Facebook or Twitter. The ease of social sharing has facilitated greater conversations around data on Tableau Public.


• | Embedding—Tableau Public views can be embedded in Web pages and blogs. Authors can enrich their websites and engage their audience with interactive visualizations based on Tableau Public.


• | Users—Tableau Public has been used by hundreds of thousands of people to make public data easy to see and understand. People have used the product to visualize and share data about government budgets, school performance, economic policy, sports statistics and box office trends. Visualizations from Tableau Public have appeared in many news organizations' publications such as BBC News and CNBC, as well as publications from bloggers and researchers.

Vizable
Vizable is a Tableau application that turns data into interactive graphs that can be shared directly from an iPad or iPhone. Vizable is a free offering that enables users to explore data on the go without requiring a server or any cloud-based services. It queries data, aggregates, and generates a visualization on the tablet within seconds. With Vizable, people can interact with their data anywhere by using simple hand gestures such as pinching, swiping, and dragging to receive instant feedback. 
Technology
Our powerful and easy-to-use products are built on a foundation of proprietary technologies. Key among these are VizQL, our Live Query Engine and In-Memory Data Engine, which work together in harmony to create our Hybrid Data Architecture.
Visual Query Language (VizQL) for Databases
At the heart of Tableau's products is our proprietary and breakthrough technology called VizQL. VizQL is a visual query language for data that simultaneously describes how to query data and how to present it visually. VizQL can deliver dramatic gains in people's ability to see and understand data. We believe VizQL is unique in several important aspects:

• | Extensibility and flexibility—VizQL is a computer language for describing pictures of data, including tables, graphs, charts, maps, time series and tables of visualizations. VizQL unifies these different visual representations into a single framework. Conventional component architectures that underlie reporting packages and charting wizards contain a fixed number of computer procedures, one for each type of picture. VizQL, in contrast, is a language for creating pictures. Each type of picture is a different statement in the language. The extensibility and flexibility of VizQL makes it possible to create a virtually unlimited number of visualizations.


• | Transforms database records to graphical representations—VizQL statements define the mapping from records returned from a database to graphical marks on a screen. Some fields in the record control the geometric properties of the mark, including position, size and orientation while other fields control visual attributes like color, transparency and shape.


• | Declarative language—VizQL is a declarative language like other database languages, including SQL. The advantage of a declarative language is that the user describes what picture should be created, not how to make it. The user does not need to be aware of underlying implementation as query, analysis and rendering operations run behind the scenes. The result is a portable and more scalable system.


• | Defines and controls queries—VizQL procedures define both the resulting picture and the database query. Our Live Query Engine generates efficient queries for external databases of many types from many vendors. VizQL also controls execution of our optimized In-Memory Data Engine to perform calculations in real time.


• | Optimized—VizQL's interpreter is optimized for interactive use, enabling visualization and drawing of large data sets. VizQL is specifically designed to take advantage of modern computer graphics hardware, such as the fast rendering chips developed for gaming that are standard on personal computers.

The initial development of VizQL began at Stanford University in 1999. Stanford University has granted us an exclusive license to commercialize the software and related patents resulting from that research. The software and related patents generally relate to three subject areas: (1) architecture for creating table-based visualizations from relational databases; (2) graphical user interface for creating specification for table-based visualizations; and (3) an environment for rapid development of interactive visualizations. Our license from Stanford University is exclusive in all fields, worldwide and sublicensable. The license agreement provides for Tableau to own all improvements to and derivative works of the software that it develops. The license agreement also provides for enforcement of the licensed patents against alleged infringers. If Stanford University and Tableau agree to jointly enforce the licensed patents against an alleged infringer, the parties equally share the costs and the recovery or settlement for such enforcement. If Stanford University and Tableau do not agree to jointly enforce the licensed patents against an alleged infringer, Stanford University and Tableau will each have the right to enforce the licensed patents against the alleged infringer. If Tableau files such a suit in a United States court, Stanford University joins such suit only for standing purposes, and Tableau wins an award of damages for, or receives a settlement payment for, infringement of a United States licensed patent, Tableau would retain that award or settlement payment and would be required to negotiate in good faith with Stanford University to compensate it for 
 10

its expenses in connection with the suit. If Stanford University files such a suit in a United States court, Tableau joins such suit only for standing purposes, and Stanford University wins an award of damages for, or receives a settlement payment for, infringement of a United States licensed patent, Stanford University would retain that award or settlement payment. The license agreement does not expire and can be terminated by Stanford University only if Tableau breaches the agreement and does not remedy the breach within 30 days after receiving written notice of the alleged breach from Stanford University. We have invested substantial research and development in VizQL since obtaining these rights. We have also been granted additional patents related to our core VizQL technology.
Live Query Engine
We have developed a Live Query Engine that interprets abstract queries generated by VizQL into syntax understandable by popular database systems. For instance, our Live Query Engine can compile VizQL statements into optimized SQL and MDX syntax understandable by database systems made by Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, IBM, EMC, SAP SE, Teradata Corporation and many other database vendors. As a result, our technology provides customers with a way to increase the accessibility, usability and performance of their databases. It also gives them a uniform user interface for interacting with databases of diverse vendors, formats and sizes.
It is common for traditional business intelligence products to import data from the organization's database systems. In contrast, Tableau's Live Query Engine enables people to query databases without having to first import the data into our products. Queries generated by our Live Query Engine are interpreted and run by the database, with only the results of each query rendered. This approach offers many advantages for customers:

• | Data consistency—Copying data can cause people to work with out-of-date information. Further, each copy of the data may represent information at different times leading to inconsistency. With our Live Query Engine, customers do not need to create additional copies of their data.


• | Avoids data movement—Moving and loading data is often time consuming and expensive. With Live Query Engine, our customers do not need to move data in order to use our products.


• | Scalability—Many database vendors provide massively parallel implementations of databases that provide scalable data access to large data sets. These systems can scale in various ways including scaling the number of tables in the database, the number of records in each table, the number of columns in each record, the number of users and the number of active queries. These systems also provide powerful computation capabilities for very large data volumes. Our Live Query Engine allows businesses to leverage their investment in scalable data infrastructure.


• | Security—Transferring data out of a database causes customers to lose the security and permissions models associated with that data. Using our Live Query Engine, customers can leverage the security and permissions models specified in their database systems.


• | Flexibility—The database industry consists of multiple vendors with competitively differentiated products. Our Live Query Engine enables our customers to choose the appropriate technology for their business.

We focus on ensuring our software is compatible with popular database platforms and that our live query technology works with the most recent releases of those platforms. Our Live Query Engine is compatible with 60 data sources, including those from the top five database vendors in the world.
We have also pioneered connectors to emerging "Big Data" and cloud technologies. We connect to open-source Hadoop databases, proprietary MapReduce technologies and cloud data warehouses like Amazon Redshift and Google BigQuery. We also connect to column stores, databases designed to process unstructured data, and Web applications such as Salesforce and Google Analytics. We believe the size of the data that our customers analyze continues to grow. We will continue to develop our live query technology with the goal of empowering our users to have complete access to any data stored anywhere.
In-Memory Data Engine
We have also developed a fast In-Memory Data Engine that allows people to analyze large amounts of data independently of database systems. This option is valuable to our customers as it enables them to overcome the following challenges:

• | Lack of databases—Much of the world's data is not stored in databases. For instance, data is commonly stored in text files, spreadsheets, logs or other formats.

 11


• | Limited performance—In addition, much of the world's data that is stored in databases resides in databases that are too slow for interactive analysis or reporting.

For these situations, we have developed an In-Memory Data Engine, with the following unique combination of attributes that enable fast calculations:

• | Column-based storage—Our In-Memory Data Engine is based on a column-oriented format which is able to reduce input/output on analytical workloads. It employs a simple disk based representation of data that leverages the operating systems' management of virtual memory.


• | Compressed data representation—Our technology utilizes compression aimed to keep the memory footprint as small as possible.


• | Optimization for in-memory analytics—Our In-Memory Data Engine is optimized for analyzing data in random access memory ("RAM"). For example, leveraging RAM-based indices, our technology is more efficient than those using disk-based indices.


• | Architecture aware algorithms—Our technology is designed to achieve high-throughput on modern processors. Key algorithms, such as grouping and aggregation, are designed to be cache and multi-core aware and adaptive to different hardware characteristics.

By importing data into our In-Memory Data Engine, our customers can get many of the benefits of a fast database without the complication, cost and delay of a new investment in databases systems. Our In-Memory Data Engine is designed to be used on commodity hardware such as personal computers, laptops and servers that are common in companies today.
Hybrid Data Architecture
We have designed our Live Query Engine and In-Memory Data Engine to work in harmony. This hybrid approach gives customers flexibility and power. For instance, customers can use our In-Memory Data Engine to import a sample of data from a large database, and then after designing an initial visualization that answers a question, run the visualization against the entire database using the live query option. As another example of the hybrid approach, customers can integrate live data with in-memory data in a single visualization or dashboard. Both of these examples can be achieved by business users without any programming or scripting.
Information about Segments and Geographic Revenue
Information about segments and geographic revenue is set forth in Note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Seasonality
We generally experience seasonal fluctuations in demand for our products and services. Our quarterly sales are impacted by industry buying patterns. As a result, our sales have generally been highest in the fourth quarter of a calendar year and lowest in the first quarter.
Customers
Our software is designed for anyone with data and questions. Our customers range from the largest corporations in the world to sole proprietors. Tableau's ease of installation and maintenance provides the flexibility to be deployed by individuals, departments or as an enterprise-wide system. We provide our products to organizations in various industries, including business services, energy and telecommunications, financial services, life sciences and healthcare, manufacturing and technology, media and entertainment, public sector and education, and retail, consumer and distribution.
We have grown our customer accounts from approximately 26,000 as of December 31, 2014 to approximately 54,000 as of December 31, 2016. We define a customer account as a purchaser of our products. Customer accounts are typically organizations. In some cases, organizations will have multiple groups purchasing our software, which we count as discrete customer accounts. No customer represented more than 10% of our total revenues in 2016, 2015 or 2014.
Support and Services
Our products are designed for our customers to be able to deploy and use on their own. However, we offer several training and professional services programs to enable our customers to maximize their experience and successful use of our products.
 12

Maintenance and Support
Our maintenance and support services provide access to new releases of our software in addition to technical support services. Our technical support team also fields "how-to" inquiries from customers related to specific product functionality.
We offer multiple levels of technical support services to our customers globally. Our highest support level includes a dedicated phone number to address critical issues, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, year-round. In addition, we offer a variety of support tools on our website including a knowledge base, product documentation guides, release notes and drivers. We have also developed an extensive online support community, which includes forums and user groups, that is intended to enable our customers to learn and to connect with each other.
Training
In order to enable our customers to be self-reliant, we offer free online training to customers on our website, including hundreds of hours of training videos, sample visualizations and best practice articles.
We also provide a variety of fee-based product training options ranging from instructor-led courses in a traditional classroom setting to online courses. These training courses are designed to deepen understanding of specific aspects of our products and range from a single day to a week in length.
Professional Services
We have also invested in a professional services organization to help our customers maximize their benefits from using our products. Our professional services are generally intended to accelerate the analytics process rather than focus on installation and configuration of our software, as we believe most of our customers are able to deploy our products without assistance. These services are delivered either in person or remotely, and we tailor our services engagements to a customer's specific needs.
Tableau Community 
We have built a strong and growing community of users and partners that help us evangelize our mission. The purpose of our community is to give customer and prospects opportunities to connect and share their experiences and ideas, and to allow them to provide valuable feedback on our products that helps us prioritize product enhancements.
Our online community currently offers:

We also organize events to engage with our customers and foster our user community. Our seminal event is our annual U.S. Tableau Customer Conference, which attracted more than 13,000 customer and partner attendees in November 2016. At this event, our customers have the opportunity to network and connect, learn best practices, attend training sessions, and present their questions and suggestions directly to our software developers, executives and other employees. In 2016, our international offering, Tableau Conference on Tour, included events in Sydney, Australia; Singapore; Paris, France; London, United Kingdom; and Munich, Germany. Finally, many of our customers form local user groups that meet periodically to discuss and share experiences using our products.
Culture and Employees
Our culture is fundamental to our success and we embrace and cultivate it with pride. Eight core values define our culture and govern our approach to business. These consist of teamwork, product leadership, using our own products, respect, honesty, simplicity and commitment to delighting our customers, as well as our mission to help people see and understand data.

We view our employees as partners in creating a great work environment, and we take a long-term approach to their recruitment and development. As a result of our careful hiring choices, we believe our company is populated by smart, respectful people grounded in humility.
As of December 31, 2016, we had 3,223 full-time employees globally. We also engage temporary employees and consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing teams collaborate to create market awareness and demand, to build a robust sales pipeline and to ensure customer success that drives revenue growth.
Sales
Our sales efforts are built on a land and expand sales model that is designed to capitalize on the ease of use, low up-front cost and collaborative capabilities of our software. To facilitate rapid adoption of our products, we provide fully functional free trial versions of our products on our website and have created a simple pricing model with no minimum purchase requirements. After an initial trial or purchase, which is often made to target a specific business need at a grassroots level within an organization, the use of our products often spreads across departments, divisions and geographies, via word-of-mouth, discovery of new use cases and our sales efforts.
Our direct sales approach includes inside sales teams and field sales teams. Our inside sales team, based in regional sales hubs, qualifies and manages accounts throughout the world in a manner in which we can seed new sales at a low cost and expand these accounts over time. Our direct field sales team covers North America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; the Asia Pacific region; and Latin America, and is mainly responsible for lead qualification and account management for large enterprises. All our direct sales teams partner with technical sales representatives who provide presales technical support. We also have a dedicated customer success team responsible for driving renewals of existing contracts.
We also sell our products through indirect sales channels including technology vendors, resellers and OEMs and independent software vendors ("ISV") partners. These channels provide additional sales coverage, solution-based selling, services and training throughout the world. Our channel program is led by a dedicated sales team and provides training, certification and sales resources to our partners. As of December 31, 2016, less than 10% of our sales team focused on indirect sales channels. We plan to continue to invest in our partner programs to help us enter and grow in new markets while complementing our direct sales efforts. 
Our sales organization also includes professional services and training teams that work with customers of all sizes to support implementations and increase adoption. These efforts include in person and phone-based engagements, webinars, in-person training and free on-demand training.
Marketing
Our marketing efforts focus on establishing our brand, generating awareness, creating leads and cultivating the Tableau community. The marketing team consists primarily of marketing operations, demand generation, enterprise marketing, product marketing, programs, field events, channel marketing, corporate communications and visual design teams. We leverage both online and offline marketing channels such as events and trade shows, seminars and webinars, third-party analyst reports, whitepapers, case studies, blogs, search engines and email marketing. A central focus for the marketing team is to drive free product trials and encourage use of our free online training, an integral part of our customer acquisition process. Our marketing team is responsible for the logistics of hosting various events, including our annual customer conferences and regional events, as well as providing Web-based community tools and supporting customer-driven user groups.
We believe the simplest way to showcase our products is by using them in live or recorded demonstrations. Our marketing team also promotes Tableau Public to generate awareness. By democratizing access to public data and facilitating sharing of insights online, Tableau Public has rapidly increased community engagement and extended the reach of our products. Interest in this service has grown quickly and is demonstrated by more than 1 billion cumulative Tableau Public page views to date.
Strategic Relationships
We view our partners as an extension of our team, playing an integral role in our development and growth. Our partner programs include technology partnerships, reseller arrangements, ISV and OEM relationships. In addition, we also work closely with system integrators, consulting firms and training partners.

Technology Vendors
Our most important technology partnerships are with data platform vendors. We collaborate with these vendors to build high performance connectivity to their data sources. We have 60 optimized data platform connectors to popular data platforms from vendors such as Amazon.com, Inc., Cloudera, Inc., IBM, Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Salesforce, SAP SE and Teradata Corporation. In addition, some of our technology partners, such as Teradata Corporation, are resellers of our products.
Resellers/VARs
Most of our indirect sales are through resellers. In certain international markets we rely more heavily on resellers than we do in the United States. Our reseller program is designed to support business growth, help generate new opportunities, optimize customer experience and care, increase profitability and close deals more quickly. We partner with value-added resellers ("VARs"), who provide vertical expertise and technical advice in addition to reselling or bundling our software. We qualify our partners carefully to help ensure that each has the necessary capabilities and technical expertise to allow us to deliver even greater value to our customers.
OEMs
We believe that software applications made by other companies can benefit from the analytical capabilities that our products can provide, and we continue to develop relationships with OEM partners that embed our software into their applications. These consist of both traditional OEMs that provide a customized version of our products for their applications as well as SaaS-based OEMs that deliver analytics as a service.
Research and Development
We invest substantial resources in research and development to drive core technology innovation and to bring new products to market. Our research and development organization, primarily located in the U.S., is predominantly responsible for design, development, testing and certification of our products and core technologies. Our mission-driven culture empowers our employees to take ownership and personal pride in building our products. We work hard to create an environment that satisfies our talents and intellectual curiosities while promoting the development of broadly impactful and transformative technologies.
We have historically targeted major product releases on an annual cycle. Since our founding, we have developed ten major versions of our products. In addition, we also provide maintenance releases with bug fixes and incremental functionality, if and when they become available, generally on a monthly basis. Our release cycles enable us to be responsive to customers by delivering new functionality on a frequent basis. We establish priorities for our organization by collaborating closely with our customers, community and employees. We use our products across all business functions at Tableau, from customer support to finance to sales and marketing to human resources, and every employee is encouraged to test and provide feedback.
Our founders conducted the original research that led to the development of VizQL at Stanford University. We actively invest in an internally focused research effort and collaborate with the research and academic community to keep current with cutting edge technologies and help us to stay at the forefront of innovation.
We are focused on hiring the top technical talent in the industry from top engineering programs and research institutions. Our talented engineers and computer scientists are focused on finding simple and elegant solutions to complex problems in information visualization, data analytics, user experience and distributed system design. 
Research and development expenses were $302.8 million, $204.1 million and $110.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Competition
Our current primary competitors generally fall into the following categories:

• | large technology companies, including suppliers of traditional business intelligence products and/or cloud-based offerings that provide one or more capabilities that are competitive with our products, such as Amazon.com, Inc., Google Inc., IBM, Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Salesforce and SAP SE;


• | business analytics software companies, such as Qlik, MicroStrategy and TIBCO Spotfire (a subsidiary of TIBCO Software Inc.); and


• | SaaS-based products or cloud-based analytics providers.

In addition, we may compete with open source initiatives and custom development efforts. We operate in a rapidly growing and rapidly changing market. As a result, we expect competition to continue to increase as other established and emerging companies enter the business analytics market, as customer requirements evolve and as new products and technologies are introduced. We expect this to be particularly true with respect to our SaaS-based offering. This is a relatively new and evolving area of business analytics solutions, and we anticipate competition to increase based on customer demand for these types of products.
Many of our competitors, particularly the large software companies named above, have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, professional services or other resources and greater name recognition than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have strong relationships with current and potential customers and extensive knowledge of the business analytics industry. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, for example by offering a SaaS-based product that competes with our on-premises products or our SaaS product, Tableau Online, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than us. Moreover, many of these competitors are bundling their analytics products into larger deals or maintenance renewals, often at significant discounts. Increased competition may lead to price cuts, alternative pricing structures or the introduction of products available for free or a nominal price, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, longer sales cycles and loss of market share. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and our business, results of operations and financial condition will be harmed if we fail to meet these competitive pressures.
Our ability to compete successfully in our market depends on a number of factors, both within and outside of our control. Some of these factors include ease and speed of product deployment and use, discovery and visualization capabilities, analytical and statistical capabilities, performance and scalability, the quality and reliability of our customer service and support, total cost of ownership, return on investment and brand recognition. Any failure by us to compete successfully in any one of these or other areas may reduce the demand for our products, as well as adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Moreover, current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others. By doing so, these competitors may increase their ability to meet the needs of our customers or potential customers. In addition, our current or prospective indirect sales channel partners may establish cooperative relationships with our current or future competitors. These relationships may limit our ability to sell or certify our products through specific distributors, technology providers, database companies and distribution channels and allow our competitors to rapidly gain significant market share. These developments could limit our ability to obtain revenues from existing and new customers and to maintain maintenance and support revenues from our existing and new customers. If we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.
Intellectual Property
We rely on federal, state, common law and international rights, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties, such as service providers, vendors, individuals and entities that may be exploring a business relationship with us.
In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and domain names to protect our intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States.
As of December 31, 2016, we had 19 issued U.S. patents directed to our technology and 43 pending patent applications in the United States. We also had three pending patent applications internationally as of December 31, 2016 with filings at the European Patent Office and in Canada and Australia. We own registered trademarks for Tableau, Tableau Software, the Tableau Logo, the Tableau Software Logo, VizQL, Show Me!, and Data In. Brilliance Out. in the United States. We also own trademark registrations for Tableau, Tableau Software, the Tableau Logo, the Tableau Software Logo, VizQL, and Show Me! in Canada and China; Tableau Software, the Tableau Logo, the Tableau Software Logo, VizQL and Show Me! in the European Union; Tableau Software, VizQL and Show Me! in Japan; Tableau, Tableau Software, the Tableau Logo, the Tableau Software Logo, and VizQL in Korea and Mexico; Tableau, Tableau Software, and VizQL in Australia; Tableau, the Tableau Logo, VizQL, and 
 16

Show Me! in Norway; and VizQL and ShowMe! in Switzerland. Such registered trademarks will expire unless renewed at various times in the future.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our applications. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult.
We expect that software and other applications in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
