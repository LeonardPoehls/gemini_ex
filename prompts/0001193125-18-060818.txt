Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company determined to discover, develop and deliver innovative treatments that provide hope to underserved patient communities. Our lead product candidate is voxelotor (previously known as GBT440), an oral, once-daily therapy that modulates hemoglobins affinity for oxygen, which we believe inhibits hemoglobin polymerization in sickle cell disease, or SCD. 
 We are currently evaluating voxelotor in SCD in a Phase 3 clinical trial in adult and adolescent patients with SCD. In addition, we are evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of voxelotor in a Phase 2a clinical trial of adolescent and pediatric patients with SCD, and in July 2017 we announced that we have expanded this open-label trial to include a new single-dose cohort in children aged 6-11. In December 2015, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted Fast Track Designation and Orphan Drug Designation for voxelotor for the treatment of SCD and in November 2016 voxelotor was granted Orphan Drug Designation in Europe for the treatment of SCD. In June 2017, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, granted PRIME designation for voxelotor for the treatment of SCD. The PRIME program is a new regulatory mechanism that provides for early and proactive EMA support to medicine developers to help patients benefit as early as possible from innovative new products that have demonstrated the potential to significantly address an unmet medical need. In September 2017, the FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease designation to voxelotor for the treatment of SCD. In January 2018, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to voxelotor for the treatment of SCD. 
 SCD is marked by red blood cell, or RBC, destruction and occluded blood flow and hypoxia, leading to anemia, stroke, multi-organ failure, severe pain crises, and shortened patient life span. Voxelotor inhibits abnormal hemoglobin polymerization, the underlying mechanism that causes sickling of RBCs. In our clinical trials to date of voxelotor in SCD patients, we observed reduced markers of red blood cell destruction, improvements in anemia, improvements in markers of tissue oxygenation, and reduced numbers of sickled RBCs. 
 SCD is a genetic blood disorder caused by a single point mutation in the beta-chain of hemoglobin, which results in the formation of abnormal hemoglobin known as sickle hemoglobin, or HbS. Normally, oxygenated RBCs travel from the lung through blood vessels. Hemoglobin is the protein inside RBCs that carries oxygen and releases oxygen at the tissues. In SCD, when oxygen is released, HbS becomes sticky and aggregates into polymers, or long, rigid rods within RBC, much like a sword within a balloon. The RBCs assume a sickled shape and becomes inflexible, which can destroy RBCs, cause blockage in small blood vessels, block blood flow, and decrease oxygen delivery to tissues. As a result, beginning in early childhood, SCD patients suffer many clinical consequences, including unpredictable and recurrent episodes, or crises, of severe chronic and acute pain, anemia, stroke, spleen failure, pulmonary hypertension, acute chest syndrome, liver disease, kidney failure, other morbidities, and premature death. These consequences are directly related to reduced blood flow and insufficient oxygen delivery. According to a 2014 publication, in the United States, SCD shortens patient life expectancy by approximately 25 to 30 years even with available medical care. 
 Current treatment options for SCD are limited to one approved therapy for adults known as hydroxyurea, one recently approved treatment for patients age five years and older called L-glutamine (marketed as EndariTM), blood transfusions and bone marrow transplantation. The utilization of these treatments is significantly limited, for hydroxyurea due to suboptimal efficacy and significant toxicity. As a result, patients with SCD continue to suffer serious morbidity and premature mortality. 
 We believe there is a significant unmet medical need for a novel SCD therapy that: 
 

 | inhibits abnormal hemoglobin polymer formation, the underlying mechanism of RBC sickling;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | stops inappropriate RBC destruction and improves blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | prevents or reduces the episodes or crises of severe pain associated with SCD;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | modifies the long-term course of the disease;
--+----------------------------------------------


 | is effective in all SCD genotypes, and in both children and adults;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


 | has a more favorable side effect profile than currently available therapies; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | is available as a convenient, oral therapy.
--+--------------------------------------------

 Voxelotors therapeutic approach was inspired by the natural activity of fetal hemoglobin, or HbF. HbF is present during fetal development and in early infancy until it is replaced with adult hemoglobin, and has an inherently increased oxygen affinity that allows a fetus to extract oxygen from the mothers blood. Typically, newborns with SCD do not experience RBC sickling until approximately six to nine months of age, after which HbF is usually no longer expressed. Additionally, it has been observed that rare individuals who have inherited both the HbS mutation as well as a gene deletion that allows them to continue to express 10% to 30% HbF in their RBCs into adulthood do not exhibit the clinical manifestations of SCD, despite expressing up to 90% sickled hemoglobin, or HbS in their blood. HbF dilutes the concentration of deoxygenated HbS that can participate in hemoglobin polymerization, and thereby significantly reduces the formation of hemoglobin polymers. 
 Voxelotor is a novel, proprietary investigational drug that increases hemoglobins affinity for oxygen by binding to the alpha-chain of hemoglobin. Voxelotor has been observed to keep a proportion of HbS in its oxygenated state so it cannot participate in polymerization. Similar to HbF, by diluting total HbS with a proportion of voxelotor-bound hemoglobin, voxelotor prevents hemoglobin polymer formation. Based on its mechanism of action, we believe that voxelotor can reduce the physical and clinical manifestations of SCD. 
 In December 2014, we initiated our randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single and multiple ascending dose Phase 1/2 clinical study of voxelotor in healthy subjects and patients with SCD. The study was conducted in three parts: single dose administration, followed by multiple dose administration, daily for 15 days in healthy subjects and 28 days in SCD subjects, and then followed by multiple dose administration, daily for up to six months in SCD subjects. In this clinical trial, we evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of voxelotor, as well as exploratory markers of SCD activity, including anti-hemolytic effects and SCD-related clinical effects. Among the 41 SCD subjects who received multiple doses of voxelotor (at doses of either 1000mg, 900mg, 700mg or 500mg per day) for 28 days up to six months, 100% of study subjects demonstrated a hematologic response to voxelotor therapy, as evidenced by improvements in one or more markers of hemolysis and anemia (hemoglobin, unconjugated bilirubin and/or percentage reticulocyte counts). In addition, all study cohorts showed marked reductions in irreversibly sickled cells in the peripheral blood from baseline, and, all study subjects treated for 90 days to up to six months showed sustained improvement in bilirubin and/or percentage reticulocyte counts, continued reductions in sickled RBCs and a median 1.0 g/dL increase in hemoglobin. In this clinical study, voxelotor was well tolerated through six months of dosing; the most common treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate headaches and gastrointestinal disorders, which occurred in similar rates in the placebo arms. 
 In August 2016, we initiated our open-label, single- and multiple-dose Phase 2a clinical study of voxelotor in adolescent and pediatric patients with SCD that we refer to as the HOPE-KIDS 1 Study. In July 2017, we expanded this open-label trial to include a single-dose cohort in children aged 6-11. The HOPE-KIDS 1 Study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and exploratory treatment effect of voxelotor in a pediatric population (age 6 to 17) with SCD. The study is being conducted in two parts: the single-dose Part A portion includes two cohorts of patients who will receive a single oral dose of 600 mg of voxelotor. Cohort 1 is complete, with seven patients age 12 to 17 enrolled. Cohort 2 is complete with six patients age 6 to 11 enrolled. Part B will explore the safety of multiple doses of voxelotor administered to patients age 12 to 17 for 24 weeks. The doses being evaluated, 900 mg per day and 1500 mg per day, are consistent with those currently being administered in our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial of voxelotor in adult and adolescent patients with SCD. Among the 13 SCD patients who received a single oral dose of 600 mg of voxelotor, 100% of the study patients demonstrated that voxelotor was well tolerated, with no serious or severe adverse events related to study drug observed. In addition, the pharmacokinetics and half-life of voxelotor were similar in adolescents (age 12 to 17) and adults, with results supporting once-daily dosing and a high specificity for hemoglobin. Among the 11 SCD adolescent patients who received multiple doses of voxelotor at 900 mg per day for whom data were available at 
 
2 


  16 weeks, 55 percent of patients demonstrated a hematologic response to voxelotor therapy, as evidenced by improvements in one or more markers of hemolysis and anemia (hemoglobin, unconjugated bilirubin and percentage reticulocyte counts). In this clinical study, voxelotor was well tolerated; the most common treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate headaches, nausea and rash. 
 Following discussions with the FDA that concluded successfully in October 2016, we have initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-national Phase 3 clinical trial of voxelotor in SCD that we refer to as the HOPE Study. The HOPE Study is designed to enroll up to approximately 400 adult and adolescent SCD patients, age 12 years and older, who have had at least one episode of vaso-occlusive crisis, or VOCs, in the previous year. The HOPE Study is being conducted in two parts: the initial Part A, which compares two dose levels of voxelotor (900 mg and 1500 mg) versus placebo, and will include up to 150 patients; followed by Part B, which will include 250 patients randomized to placebo or a dose of voxelotor selected based on the results of Part A. The main objectives of Part A are to select the optimal dose, define the final secondary endpoints for Part B and qualify the Patient Reported Outcome, or PRO, instrument. The primary efficacy endpoint of the HOPE Study is the proportion of patients who achieve a >1 g/dL increase in hemoglobin at 24 weeks of treatment compared to baseline. Key secondary efficacy endpoints include the effect of voxelotor on SCD symptom exacerbation, which will be measured by our PRO instrument, in addition to overall SCD symptoms as compared to placebo. We will also assess traditionally defined VOC as well as hospitalizations and red blood cell transfusions as secondary endpoints. 
 We believe there is a significant market opportunity in SCD. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, estimates the prevalence of SCD at approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States, where newborn screening is mandatory. It is estimated that the prevalence of SCD in Europe is approximately 60,000 individuals. The global incidence of SCD is estimated to be 250,000 to 300,000 births annually. One study estimates that in the United States, the average annual cost for the care of an adult patient with the most common genotype of SCD exceeds $200,000, and the cumulative lifetime costs exceed $8.0 million over an assumed 50-year lifespan, driven primarily by hospital admissions, physician fees, clinic and emergency department visits, and the costs of diagnostic procedures and outpatient consultations. 
 We own or jointly own and have exclusively licensed rights to our product candidates in the United States, Europe and other major markets. We are the sole owner of issued U.S. patents covering voxelotor, including its composition of matter, methods of use, and a polymorph of voxelotor. These issued patents covering voxelotor will expire between 2032 and 2035, absent any applicable patent term extensions. We own or co-own additional pending patent applications in the United States and multiple foreign countries relating to our lead product candidate voxelotor. 
 To execute on the opportunities presented by our research and development portfolio, we have assembled a team of employees, management and directors rich in scientific experience and capabilities in drug discovery, development and commercialization. Our management has a successful track record in developing and commercializing drug candidates. In aggregate, our management team has contributed to several drug approvals, including Avastin®, Herceptin®, Kaletra®, Kyprolis®, Ravicti® and Rituxan®. We intend to leverage this expertise and experience to rapidly advance the development of voxelotor for SCD and advance other product candidates. Beyond evaluating voxelotor in SCD, we are also engaged in other research and development activities, all of which are currently in the pre-clinical phase. In addition, we regularly evaluate opportunities to in-license, acquire or invest in new business, technology or assets or engage in related discussions with other business entities.

 Our Development Pipeline 
 The following table summarizes our development programs, potential indications, and their current stages of development: 
 


We were previously conducting two Phase 2a clinical trials of voxelotor for the potential treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which is a hypoxemic pulmonary disorder. We also conducted a Phase 1 study called Basecamp in healthy volunteers, which was intended to support our understanding of voxelotors effects on hypoxemia and complement our Phase 2a program in IPF. In October 2017, based upon the totality of the data we obtained from the two Phase 2a clinical studies and Basecamp study we decided to halt further development of voxelotor for the potential treatment of IPF. While the results re-affirmed our confidence in the mechanism of action of voxelotor in SCD, the data from the IPF proof-of-concept studies did not demonstrate sufficient overall clinical benefit to justify continuing the program in IPF. 
Voxelotor for the Treatment of Sickle Cell Disease 
 We are developing our lead product candidate voxelotor as a once-daily, oral therapy for patients with SCD. We are investigating voxelotors potential to inhibit the abnormal polymerization of hemoglobin, which is the underlying mechanism of RBC, sickling and leads to the associated complications that characterize SCD. We have designed a clinical program for voxelotor targeted at the treatment of adults, adolescents, children and infants across all SCD genotypes. In December 2014, we initiated our first clinical trial of voxelotor, a Phase 1/2 study in which we evaluated voxelotor in both healthy subjects and SCD subjects. In November 2016, we initiated our on-going multi-national Phase 3 clinical trial of voxelotor in adult and adolescent subjects with SCD, which we have named the HOPE Study. In addition, we are evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of voxelotor in a Phase 2a clinical trial of adolescent and pediatric patients with SCD, and in July 2017 we announced that we have expanded this open-label trial to include a new single-dose cohort in children aged 6-11. 
Sickle Cell Disease Overview 
 SCD is a grievous disease that can lead to hemolytic anemia, meaning the destruction of RBCs within blood vessels, and vaso-occlusion, which means blocked blood flow to tissues, as well as progressive multi-organ damage and early death. Beginning in childhood, patients suffer unpredictable and recurrent episodes or crises of severe pain due to blocked blood flow to organs, which often lead to physical and psychosocial disability. In addition, the constant destruction of RBCs with the release of their contents into the blood often leads to damaged or diseased blood vessels, which further exacerbate blood flow obstruction and multi-organ damage. Consequences of SCD can manifest in early childhood and may include stroke, spleen failure, pulmonary hypertension, acute chest syndrome, liver disease, kidney failure, leg ulcers, priapism, which is a medical emergency due to refractory penile erection, and premature death. According to a 2014 publication, in the United States, SCD shortens patient life expectancy by approximately 25 to 30 years even with available medical care. 
 SCD is a genetic blood disorder caused by a single gene mutation in the beta-chain of hemoglobin, which results in mutant hemoglobin known as HbS. Hemoglobin is the protein in RBCs that carries oxygen from the lungs to the bodys tissues, releases oxygen at the tissues, and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. Hemoglobin accomplishes this by binding and then releasing oxygen through allosterism, which means the 
 
4 


  hemoglobin molecule changes its shape to have a high affinity for oxygen in the lungs, where oxygen is abundant, and to have a low affinity for oxygen in the tissues, where oxygen must be released. Oxyhemoglobin, the high oxygen affinity form of hemoglobin, is formed in the lungs during respiration, when oxygen binds to the hemoglobin molecule. Deoxyhemoglobin, the low oxygen affinity form of hemoglobin, is formed when oxygen molecules are removed from the binding site as blood flows from the lungs to the tissues in the body. In patients with SCD, deoxygenated HbS, molecules polymerize to form long, rigid rods within an RBC, much like a sword within a balloon. As a consequence, the normally round and flexible RBC becomes rigid and elongate into a sickled shape. Sickled RBCs do not flow properly in the bloodstream; they clog small blood vessels and reduce blood flow to the organs. This results in inadequate oxygen delivery, or hypoxia, to all body tissues, which can lead to multi-organ failure and premature death. 
 The following graphic illustrates the process by which sickling occurs in SCD patients as a result of the polymerization of deoxygenated HbS in an RBC, leading to occluded blood flow, in contrast to a normal RBC: 
 


SCD manifests in individuals who inherit at least one HbS gene from a parent and an additional mutation on the second beta globin gene from the other parent. There are several different genotypes of SCD, including the following major genotypes: 
 
 | HbSS, or sickle cell anemia, where both genes are HbS;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


 | HbSC, where one gene is HbS, and the other is HbC (inherited by a non-SCD impacted parent); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | HbS/ßthal, where one gene is HbS, and the other is Beta thalassemia.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Market Opportunity in SCD 
 The CDC estimates the prevalence of SCD at approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States, where newborn screening is mandatory. The incidence of SCD is estimated at approximately 1 in 2,000 to 2,500 newborns in the United States. It is estimated that the prevalence of SCD in Europe is approximately 60,000 individuals. The global incidence of SCD is estimated to be 250,000 to 300,000 births annually. SCD is concentrated in populations of African, Middle Eastern and South Asian descent. 
 Of SCD patients in the United States, approximately 45% are under the age of 18, and approximately 60% to 65% have the HbSS genotype, which is often referred to as sickle cell anemia, with the remaining 35% to 40% having other genotypes. In all genotypes of SCD, the mechanism that leads to the consequences of the disease involves the polymerization of HbS in its deoxygenated state, which results in RBC sickling. We believe that because of this common underlying mechanism, voxelotor may show activity across all SCD genotypes. Our Phase 3 HOPE Study is enrolling SCD patients with all genotypes of SCD. 
 SCD is associated with high treatment costs. One study estimates that in the United States, the average annual cost for the care of an adult patient with the most common genotype of SCD exceeds $200,000, and the 
 
5 


  cumulative lifetime costs exceed $8.0 million over an assumed 50-year lifespan, driven primarily by hospital admissions, physician fees, clinic and emergency department visits and the costs of diagnostic procedures and outpatient consultations. As a result, we believe that a safe, effective and convenient oral treatment for SCD would be well received by patients, physicians and payors. 
 Current Treatment Options and Their Limitations 
 SCD remains a significant unmet medical need. The first drug approved to treat SCD, known as hydroxyurea, which was initially approved as a chemotherapy drug, was approved by the FDA in 1998 for the treatment of sickle cell anemia in adults with 3 or more painful crises per year. Hydroxyurea is currently the only drug approved for SCD, and it is not approved for pediatric SCD patients in the United States. The use of hydroxyurea is significantly limited by its side effect profile, variable patient responses and concerns regarding long-term toxicity. Hydroxyureas side effects include impairment of fertility, suppression of white blood cells, or neutropenia, and suppression of platelets, or thrombocytopenia, which place patients at risk for infection and bleeding. In July 2017, the FDA approved L-glutamine oral powder for patients age five and older with SCD to reduce severe complications associated with the disorder. In January 2018, Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc., the marketer for EndariTM (L-glutamine oral powder) announced that the product is now available to patients. 
 In addition to hydroxyurea treatment and L-glutamine, transfusions with normal blood are an option to help alleviate anemia, which is a common symptom of SCD, and reduce sickling of RBCs. Blood transfusions have a number of limitations, including the expense of treatment, lack of uniform accessibility and risks ranging from allergic reactions to serious complications such as blood-borne infection and iron overload, which can cause organ damage. The only potentially curative treatment currently available for SCD patients is bone marrow transplantation, which requires a suitable matching donor and carries significant risks, including an approximately 5% mortality rate. Despite the current standard of care, including hydroxyurea, blood transfusion and palliative therapy for acute pain attacks, patients with SCD continue to suffer serious morbidity and premature mortality. 
 In light of the devastating effects of SCD on patients and the high costs of care for these patients, there is a significant unmet need for a treatment that: 
 
 | inhibits abnormal hemoglobin polymer formation, the underlying mechanism of RBC sickling;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | stops inappropriate RBC destruction and improves blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | prevents or reduces the episodes or crises of severe pain associated with SCD;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | modifies the long-term course of the disease;
--+----------------------------------------------


 | is effective in all SCD genotypes, and in both children and adults;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


 | has a more favorable side effect profile than currently available therapies; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | is available as a convenient, oral therapy.

Overview of Hemoglobin Biology and Voxelotors Mechanism of Action 
 As described above, hemoglobin accomplishes transports oxygen from the lungs to the bodys tissues, releases oxygen into the tissues, and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs by changing its shape to be high affinity for oxygen in the lungs, where oxygen is abundant, and low affinity for oxygen in the tissues, where oxygen must be released. An important tool for assessing how readily hemoglobin acquires and binds oxygen in the lungs and releases oxygen into the tissues is the oxygen equilibrium curve, or OEC. The OEC represents the proportion of oxyhemoglobin, measured as the percentage of oxygen saturation (O2 % saturation) on the vertical axis relative to the amount of oxygen dissolved in blood, indicated as the oxygen tension, or partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), on the horizontal axis. 
 We have demonstrated in preclinical models that our novel hemoglobin modifiers, including voxelotor, bind to hemoglobin, resulting in increased oxygen affinity. The effect of voxelotor on the measured OEC (Oxygen Equilibrium Curve) is a shift of the curve to the left. In other words, at a given prevailing oxygen tension in the blood, we have observed a higher percentage of oxygen saturation, or a higher proportion of oxyhemoglobin in the blood, following the administration of voxelotor. 
 
6 


 In various studies of SCD, scientists have demonstrated that hemoglobin in the oxygenated state is a potent inhibitor of HbS polymerization. Since HbS polymerization occurs in the deoxygenated state, we believe that increasing the proportion of oxyhemoglobin, or left-shifting the OEC, should delay the polymerization of HbS and prevent the sickling of RBCs, which may ameliorate many, of the clinical manifestations of SCD. Importantly, we are able to measure the proportion of hemoglobin modification (%HbMOD), which is expressed as the percentage of hemoglobin molecules occupied or bound by voxelotor. 
 HbF, which is present during fetal development and persists for up to six to nine months in infants until it is replaced by adult hemoglobin, has an inherent high affinity for oxygen, which is critical for a developing fetus to capture oxygen from the mothers blood. Newborns with SCD do not experience RBC sickling until approximately six to nine months of age, after which HbF is no longer expressed. Additionally, it has been observed that rare individuals who have inherited the HbS mutation and a gene deletion that allows them to continue to express 10% to 30% HbF in their RBCs into adulthood do not exhibit the clinical manifestations of SCD, despite expressing up to 90% sickled hemoglobin, or HbS, in their blood. HbF dilutes the concentration of deoxygenated HbS that can participate in polymerization, and thereby prevents hemoglobin polymer from forming. 
 Based on these observations, we believe that to delay polymerization of HbS, voxelotor would need to bind to only approximately 10% to 30% of the total hemoglobin in a patients blood. One theoretical concern regarding increasing the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen is that excessive oxygen affinity could prevent hemoglobin from releasing oxygen into the tissues, thus causing hypoxia. However, based on HbF data, our animal toxicology studies, and our clinical studies, we believe our target modification of the total hemoglobin in a patients blood would not adversely compromise oxygen delivery to the tissues. 
 Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of Voxelotor 
 In December 2014, we initiated our first clinical trial of voxelotor, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single and multiple ascending dose study in which we evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of voxelotor in both healthy subjects and patients with SCD. We refer to this Phase 1/2 clinical study as the GBT440-001 study. This clinical study was conducted at Quintiles Drug Research Unit at Guys Hospital in London, United Kingdom, and was conducted in three parts, as shown in Figure 1 below: Part A (single dose administration), Part B (multiple dose administration, daily for 15 days in healthy subjects and 28 days in SCD subjects), and Part C (multiple dose administration, daily for 90 days in SCD subjects). An extension study for patients in Part C to dose some patients for up to 6 months is referred to as GBT440-024. We evaluated voxelotors ability to prevent the hemolysis or destruction of RBCs in SCD subjects primarily by measuring the blood levels of hemoglobin, bilirubin and reticulocyte counts. We also measured LDH as an additional marker of hemolysis; however it is generally more variable and nonspecific because it is released from tissues other than RBCs and does not measure extravascular hemolysis which is the primary hemolytic mechanism in SCD. In this clinical trial, we also evaluated the effect of voxelotor on morphologic sickling of RBCs. We believe that findings of decreased hemolysis and anti-sickling activity provide evidence of inhibition of sickle hemoglobin polymerization, which may translate into improved symptoms, reduction in clinical events (such as VOC) and reduced organ damage due to RBC sickling.

 Figure 1  Study Design of our Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of Voxelotor 
 


Overall, a total of 370 subjects, including 283 healthy subjects (including subjects with renal or hepatic impairment) and 53 adult SCD subjects and 28 adolescent subjects with SCD (12 to 17 years of age), and 6 pediatric subjects with SCD (6 to 11 years of age) have been administered single or multiple doses of voxelotor across 15 GBT-sponsored clinical studies. Subjects received single or multiple doses of voxelotor (up to 15 days in healthy subjects, and up to 180 days in subjects with SCD). The studies included 2 Phase 1/2 studies in healthy subjects and subjects with SCD (GBT440-001 and its extension study GBT440-024), 1 Phase 2a study in pediatric participants with SCD (GBT440-007), and 12 clinical pharmacology studies. The most commonly reported adverse events, or AEs, regardless of treatment causality, across SCD subjects included mild or moderate headache, back pain, pain, diarrhea, pain in extremity and rash. All events of diarrhea were mild. Most of these events resolved without treatment and are easily monitored. Of these events, treatment-emergent adverse event were diarrhea, headache and rash. Some subjects with SCD experienced acute painful sickle cell crisis, which was thought to be related to underlying SCD, and not to voxelotor. 
 In our Phase 1/2 clinical study, we had no drug-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, reported. A total of 16 SAEs (12 from adult subjects and 4 from adolescent subjects), each of which were assessed to be not related to study drug, were reported in SCD subjects. 
 Among the 41 SCD patients who received multiple doses of voxelotor (at doses of either 500 mg, 700 mg, 900 mg, or 1000 mg per day) in our Phase 1/2 clinical study for 28 days up to six months, 100% of study subjects demonstrated a hematologic response to voxelotor therapy, as evidenced by significant improvement in one or more clinical markers of hemolysis and anemia (hemoglobin, unconjugated bilirubin and/or percentage reticulocyte counts). In addition, all study cohorts showed marked reductions in irreversibly sickled RBCs in the peripheral blood from baseline, and all study subjects treated for 90 days up to six months showed sustained improvement in bilirubin and/or percentage of reticulocyte counts, continued reductions in sickled RBCs and a median 1.0g/dL increase in hemoglobin. There was no evidence of tissue hypoxia; trends to erythropoietin reductions and the reduction in reticulocyte counts were consistent with an improvement in tissue oxygen delivery; oxygen delivery to tissues at rest and during exercise was normal.

 The tables below show that SCD subjects in our Phase 1/2 study who were treated for 90 days to six months with voxelotor showed a durable and significant hemoglobin increase as compared to placebo. In addition, SCD subjects in this study showed sustained improvements in bilirubin level as well as counts of reticulocyte and irreversibly sickled cells, and a greater increase in hemoglobin than at day 28.

Day 1 | Day 90 (Voxelotor 700 mg)

 We believe the expanding clinical evidence demonstrating that voxelotor was well tolerated up to 6 months of dosing and that voxelotor inhibits irreversibly sickled cells, improves hemolytic anemia, and reduces RBC damage continues to support the potential for voxelotor to serve as a disease-modifying therapy for SCD. 
 HOPE  KIDS 1 Study 
 In August 2016, we initiated our open-label, single and multiple-dose Phase 2a clinical study of voxelotor in adolescent and pediatric patients with SCD which we refer to as the HOPE-KIDS 1 Study. As shown below in Figure 3, this ongoing study is being conducted in two parts, Part A: single dose of voxelotor at 600 mg in pediatric patients (6 to 11 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years) and Part B: multiple doses of voxelotor at 2 dose levels, 900 mg/d and 1500 mg/d for 24 weeks in adolescents (approximately 12 patients at each dose). Part A pharmacokinetics, or PK, data in adolescents was previously reported at the 2017 European Hematology Association Congress and demonstrated that the PK and half-life of voxelotor were similar in adolescents and adults with results supporting once-daily dosing. Part A data for pediatric patients (6 to 11 years) was presented at the 2017 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, or ASH. Voxelotor PK exposures were higher in children compared with adolescents and adults, which informs dose selection for future pediatric studies in children under 12 years of age. The primary objective of Part B is to assess the effect of voxelotor on anemia. Secondary objectives include effect on clinical measures of hemolysis, PK (PK parameters determined using population PK analysis), daily SCD symptoms as measured by Total Severity Score, or TSS, using a PRO measure and safety.

 Figure 3  Study Design of our Phase 2a Clinical Trial of Voxelotor 
 


In December 2017 at ASH, we presented data from the 900 mg Part B portion of the HOPE-KIDS 1 Study for patients that had received 16 weeks of voxelotor treatment. The median age of the patients was 13 years, 92% were on hydroxyurea and 59% had no VOCs in the prior year. Despite the majority of patients being on hydroxyurea, 55% of the patients achieved a hemoglobin response greater than 1 g/dl at week 16. Other clinical measures of hemolysis also improved concordantly; median reduction in reticulocytes and unconjugated bilirubin were 11% and 40% respectively, consistent with the results previously reported in SCD adults treated with voxelotor. Additionally, 10 out of 12 patients showed a reduction in TSS as measured by the PRO from baseline to week 16 of treatment with a 94% median reduction in TSS from baseline. From a safety and tolerability perspective, 900 mg of voxelotor was well tolerated up to 24 weeks of dosing. There were no drug related SAEs and the drug-related AEs were deemed mild to moderate with the exception of one grade 3 rash (which did not recur with continued dosing). There were no study discontinuations due to AEs. 
 Phase 3 HOPE Study of Voxelotor 
 The HOPE Study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-national, Phase 3 clinical trial enrolling up to approximately 400 adult and adolescent SCD patients age 12 and older who have had at least one episode of VOC in the previous year (see Figure 4). The HOPE Study is being conducted in two parts: the initial Part A, which will compare two dose levels of voxelotor (900 mg and 1500 mg) versus placebo, and will include up to 150 patients; followed by Part B, which will include 250 patients randomized to placebo or a dose of voxelotor selected based on the results of Part A. The main objectives of Part A are to select the optimal dose for Part B, define the final secondary endpoints for Part B and qualify the PRO instrument. The primary efficacy endpoint of the HOPE Study is the proportion of patients who achieve a >1 g/dL increase in hemoglobin at 24 weeks of treatment compared to baseline. Our discussions with the FDA have focused on a path-way to full approval based on the HOPE Study, by meeting the primary and at least one key secondary endpoint, although achieving this outcome will depend in large part on the data and results obtained from the study itself. Key secondary efficacy endpoints include the effect of voxelotor on SCD symptom exacerbation, which will be measured by our PRO instrument, in addition to overall SCD symptoms as compared to placebo. The PRO is administered on a hand-held electronic device, and is designed to capture the full range of daily SCD symptoms. The HOPE Study will also assess traditionally defined VOC as well as hospitalizations and red blood cell transfusions as secondary endpoints.

 Figure 4: Phase 3 HOPE Study Design 
 


We are conducting the Phase 3 HOPE Study at leading SCD sites around the globe, enrolling adults and adolescents with SCD who have had at least one episode of VOC in the previous year. The HOPE Study was initiated in December 2016 and we anticipate announcing top-line Part A results in the first half of 2018 and receipt of top-line data results in the first half of 2019. 
European Union Regulatory Path for Voxelotor 
 We are engaged in discussions with European regulatory authorities to define the future development plan for voxelotor. The objectives of these regulatory interactions include discussion of study design for additional clinical trials, trial endpoints and the development of voxelotor in other patient populations, including pediatrics. 
 In November 2016, the European Commission, or EC, granted Orphan Drug Designation status in the European Union, or EU, for voxelotor for the treatment of SCD. In June 2017, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, granted PRIME designation for voxelotor for the treatment of SCD. The PRIME program is a new regulatory mechanism that provides for early and proactive EMA support to medicine developers to help patients benefit as early as possible from innovative new products that have demonstrated the potential to significantly address an unmet medical need. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for all of our requirements of raw materials, drug substance and drug product for our nonclinical research and our ongoing clinical trials of our lead product candidate voxelotor. We have not entered into long-term commercial manufacturing agreements with our current CMOs. We intend to continue to rely on CMOs for later-stage development and commercialization of voxelotor, as well as the development and commercialization of any other product candidates that we may identify. Although we rely on CMOs, we have personnel and third-party consultants with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the relationships with our contract manufacturers. 
 We believe the synthesis of the drug substance for voxelotor is reliable and reproducible from readily available starting materials, and the synthetic routes are amenable to large-scale production and do not require unusual equipment or handling in the manufacturing process. We have obtained an adequate supply of the drug substance for voxelotor from our CMOs to satisfy our immediate clinical and nonclinical demands. We have implemented improvements to our drug substance manufacturing process to further ensure production capacity adequate to meet future development and potential commercial demands.

 We have completed development for a solid oral formulation of a tablet form of voxelotor as well as a pediatric dispersible tablet formulation of voxelotor. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents and patent applications intended to cover our product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other aspects of inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio. We endeavor to promptly file domestic and international patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions, including applications directed to compositions and methods of treatment created or identified from our ongoing development of our product candidates. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights protecting our commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our current and future issued patents, if any, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our intellectual property portfolio. 
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent, if any, is issued, and patent scope can be reinterpreted by the courts after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any patents, if issued, will provide sufficient protection from competitors for our business. 
 Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine the priority of inventions. 
 Patents 
 Our patent portfolio includes multiple issued U.S. patents, as well as multiple U.S. and foreign patent applications in various stages of prosecution or allowance. Our primary patents and patent applications relate to our general HbS intellectual property portfolio, which includes our lead product candidate voxelotor and its development program. 
 Our HbS intellectual property portfolio is comprised of multiple patent families of patents and patent applications relating to voxelotor and/or analogs that inhibit Hb polymerization. These patent families include patents and patent applications specifically related to our lead product candidate voxelotor covering certain compositions of matter, methods of use, method of manufacture, formulations, and polymorphs of voxelotor, as well as certain compositions of matter, methods of use, method of manufacture, formulations, and polymorphs. These patent applications are pending in a variety of jurisdictions, including the United States, jurisdictions under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and other countries. 
 With regard to voxelotor specifically, we are the sole owner of issued U.S. patents covering voxelotor, including its composition of matter, methods of use and a polymorph of voxelotor. These issued U.S. patents covering voxelotor will expire between 2032 and 2035, absent any applicable patent term extensions. Any patents that may issue from our pending patent applications relating to voxelotor in the United States or from corresponding foreign patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2032 and 2037, absent any 
 
13 


  applicable patent term extensions. Some of these pending patent applications are jointly owned by us and Regents of the University of California, or the Regents, as described below. 
 Our other patents in our HbS intellectual property portfolio are comprised of additional issued U.S. patents covering voxelotor analogs. These patents, and any patents that may issue from our pending patent applications relating to voxelotor analogs in the United States or from corresponding foreign patent applications, if issued, are currently expected to expire between 2032 and 2034, absent any applicable patent term extensions. Some of these pending patent applications are jointly owned by us and the Regents, as described below. 
 In addition, we have exclusively licensed from the Regents worldwide patent rights covering voxelotor and certain voxelotor analogs, some of which patent rights we jointly own with the Regents. In exchange for our exclusive license, we have agreed to pay a royalty to the Regents of less than 1% on future net sales and to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture, market and sell the products covered by the licensed patents. The risks associated with joint ownership of patent rights are more fully discussed under Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property. 
 Beyond our HbS intellectual property portfolio, we own other issued U.S. patents, seek to obtain additional issued patents, and file patent applications relating to our other research and development programs over time. 
 Patent term 
 The base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority, assuming that all maintenance fees are paid. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the USPTO the extent of which is offset by delays by the patent owner before the USPTO in obtaining the patent. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by a terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent. The term of a U.S. patent may be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to account for at least some of the time the drug is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a drug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of an FDA-approved drug, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the drug and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, have analogous patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. In the future, if our lead product candidate voxelotor or any other product candidates receive FDA approval, we would expect to apply for patent term extension on patents, if issued, covering those products, their methods of use and/or methods of manufacture. 
 Trade secrets 
 In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect trade secrets and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entities relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.

 Sales and Marketing 
 We intend to begin building a commercial infrastructure in the United States prior to New Drug Application submission to ensure that a commercial team is in place at the time of potential FDA approval. Approximately 100,000 Americans have been diagnosed with SCD and 80% of those living with SCD reside in 17 states. Many SCD patients receive care from a hematologist or another sickle cell care provider. Thus, the US commercial market for SCD is highly concentrated both in terms of geography and prescribing audience. We expect to be able to efficiently support the commercial launch of voxelotor by building our own targeted commercial organization including internal sales personnel, key payer account management, marketing and distribution support. We plan to also build a patient support program to support commercial launch. 
 We are considering building additional capabilities that may be necessary to effectively support the commercialization of voxelotor outside of the United States. These capabilities will likely focus on a limited number of core European markets, where SCD is prevalent. Where appropriate, we may also utilize strategic partners, distributors or contract sales forces to expand the commercial availability of voxelotor. We currently do not expect that we will require large pharmaceutical partners for the commercialization of our product candidates, although we may consider partnering in certain territories, New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, or indications for other strategic purposes. We intend to evaluate our commercialization strategy as we advance our preclinical programs in other rare disease indications. 
 Competition 
 The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. There are many public and private biopharmaceutical companies, universities, governmental agencies and other research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our product candidates or address similar markets. In addition, the number of companies seeking to develop and commercialize products and therapies similar to our product candidates is likely to increase. 
 In the area of SCD, we expect to face competition from the two currently FDA approved treatments: hydroxyurea (marketed as DROXIA or Hydrea by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company as well as in generic form), approved for reducing the frequency of painful crises and need for blood transfusions in patients with sickle cell anemia for the treatment of adults with SCD and EndariTM (marketed by Emmaus), approved for the reduction of acute complications of sickle cell disease in patients age five years and older. Several companies are also developing product candidates for chronic treatment in SCD. Novartis AG is engaged in the clinical development of crizanlizumab, an anti-P-selectin monoclonal antibody and is expected to file for FDA approval by the end of 2018. Sancilio has announced they will be initiating a phase 3 trial in 2018 for AltemiaTM (SC411), docosahexaenoic acid. Several other agents are in early clinical trials investigating new mechanisms of action for the chronic treatment of SCD. We also expect to face competition from one-time therapies for patients with severe SCD, including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, gene therapy and gene editing. For example, bluebird bio, Inc. is currently engaged in the clinical development of LentiGlobin BB305, which aims to treat SCD by inserting a functional human beta-globin gene into the patients own hematopoietic stem cells, or HSCs, ex vivo and then transplanting the modified stem cell into the patients bloodstream. While not directly competitive with preventative agents like voxelotor, several agents are also in development for the acute treatment of SCD crises including rivipansel, being developed by Pfizer Inc. 
 Some of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those treatments. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.

 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Pricing of such products is also subject to regulation in many countries. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. 
 U.S. drug development 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDAs refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application, or NDA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following: 
 

 | completion of extensive nonclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDAs GLP regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practices, or GCPs, and other clinical-trial related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug for each proposed indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an NDA, for a new drug;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA whether to accept it for filing and review;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drugs identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The nonclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any of our product candidates, including voxelotor, 
 
16 


  will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct development stages: nonclinical and clinical. The nonclinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing in humans. As the drug sponsor, we must submit the results of the nonclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. 
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsors control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. 
 Clinical trials 
 Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, which may overlap. 
 

 | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the product candidate.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose of the product candidate required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product candidate for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase 3 clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval, to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA. 
 As the drug sponsor, we must submit progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials and other information at least annually to the FDA, as well as written IND safety reports to the FDA and the study investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug and any clinically important increase in 
 
17 


  the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must include methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 NDA and FDA review process 
 The results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP requirements to assure and preserve the products identity, strength, quality and purity. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be legally marketed in the United States. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA is typically accompanied by a user fee (adjusted on an annual basis). According to the FDAs fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2018, the user fee for an NDA is approximately $2.4 million. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug product program fee for human drugs ($304,000). Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business having fewer than 500 employees. Additionally, an application for a product that has been designated as a drug for a rare disease or condition (referred to as an orphan drug) under section 526 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is not subject to an application fee unless the application includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition. Voxelotor for the treatment of sickle cell disease has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA and by the European Commission. 
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA is supposed to make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt of the submission. Once the NDA is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA is supposed to complete its initial review of an NDA that it has accepted for review and respond to the applicant within stated periods (within 10 months for a standard NDA and six months for an NDA designated by the agency for priority review). However, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product (including the facilities of contract manufacturers, if applicable) to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA may also audit data from clinical 
 
18 


  trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. There are likely to be extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The review and evaluation of an NDA by the FDA is very comprehensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete. 
 After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form, and usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The complete response letter may require additional clinical data and/or additional clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. 
 United States Orphan drug designation 
 We were granted orphan drug designation for voxelotor for the treatment of SCD by the FDA in 2015. Under the Orphan Drug Act in the United States, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States (or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States in limited circumstances). Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, but does confer other potential development and commercialization benefits as described below. 
 If we submit an NDA seeking approval for voxelotor for the treatment of sickle cell disease, this NDA submission should qualify for the orphan user fee exemption from the PDUFA application fee. In addition, we should qualify for additional incentives, including tax credits for qualifying clinical trials, and may also qualify for a substantial period of market exclusivity. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or by providing a major contribution to patient care. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. A competitor could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years by obtaining orphan product exclusivity for the same product (or a competitor product that contains our product candidate) for the same indication we are seeking (although we are not aware that any competitor is seeking to develop voxelotor for sickle cell disease alone or as part of a competitors product). If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union, or EU, has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits. 
 Expedited development and review programs 
 In addition to the US orphan drug designation, our product candidate voxelotor has received a Fast Track designation from the FDA for the potential treatment of sickle cell disease. The FDAs Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life 
 
19 


  threatening condition, where nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review. 
 A product candidate may obtain accelerated approval if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or another significant clinical benefit. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA may require that the drug sponsor perform post-approval clinical trials, and may impose marketing restrictions to limit distribution or use to assure safe use of the drug. 
 Additionally, our product candidate voxelotor has received a breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for the potential treatment of sickle cell disease. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as a Fast Track designation, in addition to intensive guidance from FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Pediatric information 
 Our product candidate voxelotor has also received a Rare Pediatric Disease designation from the FDA for the potential treatment of SCD. The FDA defines a rare pediatric disease as a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals age 18 years or younger, and is a rare disease that impacts fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. The Rare Pediatric Disease designation provides incentives to advance the development of rare disease drugs and biologics. Additionally, the FDAs Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program states that a sponsor with a Rare Pediatric Disease designation who receives an NDA or Biologic License Application (BLA) approval for a rare pediatric disease may be eligible for a voucher that can be redeemed to obtain priority review for any subsequent marketing application. 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, as amended, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration is required to submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no end-of-Phase 2 meeting as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. 
 
20 


 Post-marketing requirements 
 Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences and complying with complex promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or for patient populations for which the drug was not approved (known as off-label use), and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and on interactions with healthcare providers. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use of these materials, and may be required to be reviewed in advance in certain circumstances such as a new product launch. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the pharmaceutical company may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require additional data or the conduct of additional nonclinical studies and clinical trials. 
 FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP requirements. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP requirements. Our third party manufacturers must comply with cGMP requirements that require among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation, and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP requirements, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including recall. 
 Other regulatory matters 
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the United States Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments. 
 For example, in the United States, sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order, or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes created by the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. 
 Moreover, although as a drug manufacturer we would not submit claims directly to payors, drug manufacturers can be held liable under the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from knowingly 
 
21 


  presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. The government may deem manufacturers to have caused the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and the potential implication of various federal criminal statutes. 
 Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
 The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subject firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our managements attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way. 
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the voluntary recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. 
 United States patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of any of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the products approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the patent term extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves any application for patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our voxelotor product candidate, 
 
22 


  depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. 
 Marketing exclusivity provisions under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act provide a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. So far as we are aware, voxelotor would qualify as a new chemical entity under these provisions. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator who holds the NDA for the active agent. 
 The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA for a drug product that contains an active moiety that has been previously approved if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication. 
 Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA by a competitor. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States which, if granted, adds six months to the end of existing exclusivity periods and patent terms, and may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued pre-approval written request for such a pediatric trial where information relating to the use of the product candidate in a pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population. 
 European Union drug development, Orphan Drug and PRIME designations 
 In the EU, our product candidates may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory authorities has been obtained. 
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of nonclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred. 
 The EU clinical trials legislation is currently undergoing an ongoing revision process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining the clinical trials authorization process, simplifying adverse event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials, and increasing their transparency. 
 In November 2016, the European Commission, acting on a positive recommendation from the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, designated voxelotor as 
 
23 


  an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of sickle cell disease. Orphan drug status in the EU has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits to US orphan drug status, including 10 years of marketing exclusivity from the approval of the marketing application, designated product-specific consultation by the EMA, and certain reductions or exemptions in regulatory fees. 
 In June 2017, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, granted PRIME designation for voxelotor for the treatment of SCD. The PRIME program is a new regulatory mechanism that provides for early and proactive EMA support to medicine developers to help patients benefit as early as possible from innovative new products that have demonstrated the potential to significantly address an unmet medical need. 
 European Union drug review and approval 
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations: 
 The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. This mandatory Centralized Procedure applies in the case of voxelotor for sickle cell disease, in light of the 2016 designation of voxelotor as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of sickle cell disease. 
 The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. 
 National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned). 
 Under the above-described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 European Union new chemical entity exclusivity 
 In the EU, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovators data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the 
 
24 


  innovators data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
 European Union orphan designation and exclusivity 
 In the EU, the European Commission, after reviewing the opinion of the EMAs Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU Community (or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the investment) and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). 
 In the EU, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. In November 2016 we were granted orphan drug designation in the EU for voxelotor for the potential treatment of SCD. 
 Rest of the world regulation 
 For other countries outside of the EU and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Reimbursement 
 Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, as well as the level of reimbursement such third-party payors provide for our products. Patients and providers are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists, and one payors determination to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that other payors will make a similar determination. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. The coverage determination process is often time-consuming and costly and is likely to require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor individually, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. 
 The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of 
 
25 


  Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, and mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs. 
 The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturers outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, the ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP, and adding a new rebate calculation for line extensions (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, creating a new methodology by which rebates are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization as of 2010 and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits (phased-in by 2014). Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. 
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. Any negotiated prices for any of our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors. 
 For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although under the current state of the law these newly eligible entities (with the exception of childrens hospitals) will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. As 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. 
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage 
 
26 


  policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our drug candidates, if any such drug or the condition that they are intended to treat are the subject of such research. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitors drug could adversely affect the sales of our drug candidate. If third-party payors do not consider our drugs to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our drugs after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment or utilization may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis. 
 In recent years, additional laws have resulted in direct or indirect reimbursement reductions for certain Medicare providers, including: 
   The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislations automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. 
   The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 These laws, and future state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. 
 As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. We expect that an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 In many foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products, for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved. 
 US Healthcare Reform 
 The ACA has had a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The ACA expanded coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, the ACA, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and a new Medicare Part D coverage gap 
 
27 


  discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. 
 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld certain key aspects of the legislation, including a tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly the requirement that all individuals maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty, referred to as the individual mandate. However, the new presidential administration has indicated that enacting changes to the ACA is a legislative priority, and has discussed repealing and replacing or amending the ACA. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation to date, the 2017 Tax Reform Act includes a provision repealing the individual mandate, effective starting in 2019. In addition, in 2017 President Trump signed executive orders directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices, and terminated the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. The termination of cost-sharing subsidies is the subject of several legal challenges, and other legal challenges may ensue over time as this complex set of challenges to the ACA continues to unfold. In addition, CMS has proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. 
 The full impact of the ACA, any law repealing, replacing, or modifying elements of it, and the political uncertainty surrounding its repeal, replacement, or modification on our business remains unclear. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare drugs and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability and may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. 
 For any of our product candidates, including voxelotor, which may obtain regulatory approval and are marketed in the United States, our arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers, and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to health information privacy and security regulation by U.S. federal and state governments and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims laws, HIPAA, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and analogous state laws and regulations such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws and analogous non-U.S. fraud and abuse laws and regulations, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
