 Business.
Overview 
 DS Healthcare Group, Inc. (formerly Divine Skin, Inc.) (d/b/a DS Laboratories) is a Florida corporation organized on January 26, 2007. DS Healthcare Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company or DS Healthcare) develop proprietary technologies and products for hair care and personal care needs. Management believes the Company is currently a leading innovator of (1) Liposome Technology, which acts as a carrier agent, and has been designed to enhance the act ion of the active ingredients in our products, and (2) Nanosome Technology, which acts as a delivery vehicle, and has been designed to infuse active compounds into targeted cells for increased efficiency of our products. The Company has grown steadily since inception with a network of retailers across North America and distributors throughout Europe, Asia and South America. DS Healthcare currently researches and develops (formulates) its own products. We currently offer the following lines of products: hair care, skin care and personal care. 

Our current principal products are discussed below. We formulate, market and sell these products through specialty retailers, spas, salons, pharmacies and other distributors. Our products are compounded either in our laboratory or through various third party compounders on an orderby-order basis. 

Our Company
 We are a global personal-care, product development and marketing company. We develop and market proprietary branded personal care products that address thinning hair conditions, skin care and other personal care needs. We currently research, develop and formulate our own products, consistent with our mission to provide products that make a meaningful difference in the lives of our customers. 

We compete in the personal care markets by focusing on developing innovative technologies and products that more adequately meet the personal care needs of consumers. Our current products are primarily sold under our DS Laboratories brand. We also sell certain products under our Polaris Labs and Sigma Skin brands. We market and sell these products through salons, spas, department stores, specialty retailers and distributors. 

We have grown steadily since our inception through sales to a variety of specialty retailers, salon chains and distributors in North America and through distributors and pharmacies for international sales. We have a growing base of domestic and international customers with several large salon chains and distributors, which collectively sell to over 10,000 salons and retail outlets throughout the world. Our current principal products, which are all sold under our DS Laboratories brand, are set forth below.


Thinning Hair | Hair Care | Skin Care | Personal Care
Revita | Dandrene | Hydroviton | Nirena 
Revita LT | Continuum | Keramene | Spectral.Lash
Revita Cor | | Oligio | 
Spectral | | Trioxil | 

Our Key Strategies 

We offer a broad range of branded, personal care products that address various personal needs applications in the hair care market, specifically technology for thinning hair. All of our products and technology are a result of internally researched and developed formulas. Our product development activities are not limited to any particular product category; rather, we take a broad approach to personal care applications and develop products that serve specific needs. The ingredients within our products implement technologies that utilize encapsulation techniques which we believe improve the effectiveness and spectrum of the active ingredients of our products. Our thinning hair technology, Nanoxidil, a proprietary compound, for example, is designed to stimulate follicles on the entire scalp. We believe Nanoxidil surpasses competing products in terms of efficacy and tolerability due to its higher level of penetration and prolonged therapeutic effect because of its relatively low molecular weight. Our research into the mechanism of thinning hair has also led us to develop applications to suppress unwanted body hair growth.

Our historical revenue growth has been primarily driven by the following three factors: 1) introduction of new and innovative products, 2) increasing distribution in new channels and territories and 3) supporting existing distribution with education, training and marketing. We believe the most rapid way to accelerate revenue growth is to aggressively support our existing customer base and concurrently expand into new markets.

We intend to continue to capitalize on several opportunities to increase our market share and revenues. We currently have a distributor network through which our products are placed in over 1,000 salon-based retail outlets in the United States and distributors in over 15 countries. We intend to increase revenues and achieve profitability by continuing to develop and market new products while aggressively supporting our distribution partners. 
 
Sales and Marketing
We are increasingly marketing our products directly to salons, pharmacies, spas, department stores and specialty retailers in an effort to foster greater brand loyalty. However, a majority of our current sales are made to distributors. We sell our products in the U.S. and internationally, principally through both U.S. and internationally based distributors and in Mexico through our Mexican subsidiary, Divine Skin Laboratories, S.A. DE C.V.

We utilize our branded website to provide information about our Company, products and technology and are developing a viable E-Commerce business on via our website. All marketing and communications efforts feature a constant internet based strategy which we believe allows us to leverage our brand to generate sales. 

Corporate Background
Our corporate headquarters are located at 1601 Green Road, Pompano Beach, Florida 33064. Our phone number is (888) 404-7770. We own and operate several websites, including dshealthgroup.com, polarisresearchlab.com, polarisresearchlabs.com and dslaboratories.com. Information contained on our websites is not part of this report. Our Company was organized under the name Divine Skin, Inc. and we changed our corporate name to DS Healthcare Group, Inc. in November 2012.

Our corporate structure is set forth below:

Our consolidated financial statements include the operating activities of Velocity Storage and Packaging, LLC (Velocity), which are accounted for as Variable Interest Entity (VIE). Velocity performed packaging and shipping services exclusively for the Company. The Companys variable interest relates to a financing arrangement whereby, all operational expenses, including labor costs, facility costs and other operational expenses are reimbursed by the Company at Velocitys cost. The Company has no equity investment in Velocity and Velocity has no assets, liabilities or equity structure of its own. Accordingly, the Company determined that Velocity is a VIE and the Company is the primary beneficiary under the guidance offered in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810-10 since Velocity does not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its own activities. ASC 810-10 requires that an enterprise consolidate a VIE if that enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity's expected losses if they occur. On October 31, 2016, Velocity ceased performing service for its operation with the Company. All of Velocitys employees were hired by the company for the purpose of performing necessary packaging and shipping services.

Products 
 Our business model is to develop products with unique features and benefits that are outside the scope of general products offering by larger competitors in our industry. Our products are developed (formulated) internally to fill a niche product category so that we can create new products without direct competition from larger, better capitalized market participants and achieve organic growth with minimal investment. The company has developed and optimized nanosome encapsulation technology, which is employed to entrap and deliver active ingredients in certain product more efficiently and safely in order to improve overall product performance. Our current principal products are as follows: 
Hair Care
 We have developed a line of shampoos and conditioners, which includes products specifically designed to treat thinning hair, dandruff and other common hair care conditions.

Revita® Shampoo and Revita.Cor Conditioner
 Revita and Revita LT are high performance hair stimulating shampoos. Revita.Cor is our hair stimulating conditioner which employs nanosomal encapsulation technology. Revita uses a combination of materials specially designed to maintain scalp vitality and act on follicle dysfunctions. This formulation is developed completely without the use of harsh chemicals such as Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Sodium Laureth Sulfate, commonly used low cost detergents in shampoos and cleansers that are linked to skin irritation, drying, and hair loss due to follicle attack. It contains a high concentration of caffeine, among other ingredients. Revita LT is formulated for customers with lighter colored hair.
Spectral
 Our Spectral line of topical lotions and sprays are designed for men with advanced androgenic alopecia  male pattern baldness. Spectral.DNC, a spray formula, Spectral.DNC-L, a lotion, are designed to re-grow hair through multiple pathways. One of the active ingredients in Spectral DNC and DNC-L is Procyanidin B-2 complex. We believe this formula helps retain and re-grow hair. In an independent study published in the British Journal of Dermatology in 2002, Procyanidin B-2 was shown to shorten the hair resting phase and prolong the hair growth phase, therefore increasing hair growth results. This treatment uses over 10 active compounds that trigger different processes in the scalp to generate healthy hair and contains nanosome microspheres to enhance absorption into the skin. Spectral DNC and Spectral DNC-L are only sold outside the United States. Our Spectral DNC-N, sold in the United States, is a spray formula and is the first treatment to employ Nanoxidil 5%, a powerful new non-prescription non-OTC alternative to existing formulations offering high efficacy, with no known side effects. 

Spectral.RS is a topical treatment for men and women with initial stage androgenic alopecia. It is designed to address multiple causes that lead to thinning hair such as perifollicular fibrosis and internal factors such as stress, hormonal disturbances, lack of vitamins and mineral salts, and the use of certain medications. Perifollicular fibrosis is a condition that accompanies all hair loss whereby the collagen around the hair root becomes rigid and tightens, pushing a root to the surface and causing premature hair loss. One of the active ingredients in Spectral.RS is Adenosine. This ingredient was shown to be effective in an independent clinical study conducted by Shiseido Laboratories in 2005 to induce hair growth.

Dandrene®
 Dandrene is an antidandruff shampoo formulated with highest concentration of Zinc pyrithione, an over the counter (OTC) drug designed to treat itchy scalp and dandruff. The product provides relief from scaling, irritation, redness and flaking associated with dandruff, psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis.
Continuum
 Human hair are prone to considerable damage due to several factors such as normal aging, exposure to certain environmental conditions such as sunlight and most significantly due to bleaching process. Anatomically, a single hair strand can be represented as a rope made up of systematically arranged cortical fibers with an additional protective cover called cuticles. Exposure to detrimental factors or bleaching process causes weakening of hair cuticles and lessening of cortical fibers that leads to undesirable surface roughness and eventually breakage. Continuum is an innovative product created by combining unique molecules, a precursor and activators, to strengthen the connections between cortical fibers in order to regain hair strength; and, to rearrange cuticles so that to ensure its maximum protective efficacy and natural shine to the hair. Continuum line includes three product  Ro.Maxx, Ro.Zen and Ro.Topia.

Skin Care
 Hydroviton®
 Hydroviton is a skin cleanser, developed for oily and acne prone skin. It contains liposome encapsulated azelaic acid, which has shown by independent study to suppress 5α-reductase, a hormone that causes oily skin. 

Keramene®
 Keramene is formulated to suppress hair growth and softens remaining hair strands. Keramene combines plant hormones, natural palmatine and nondihydroguaiaretic acid. Keramene performs through two complementary pathways: 1) inducing follicles into the catagen state so they stop growing hairs, and 2) suppressing kerafinocyte proliferation so remaining hairs grow slower. Keramene contains Telocapil, among other ingredients, which has been shown by independent study to reduce hair growth. 
Oligo®
 Oligo.DX is a cream that is designed to improve the appearance of cellulite from womens thighs, hips and buttocks. It contains a liposomal complex of caffeine and escin, among other ingredients.
Trioxil®
 Trioxil is an anti-acne gel. It contains Ichthyol Pale among other ingredients, which has been shown to reduce skin blemishes under an independent study.

Personal Care
 Nirena®
 Nirena is an intimate feminine care cleanser developed without cheap detergents, harsh chemicals, and low pH tolerances, which are generally found in other commercially available products. The principle active ingredient in Nirena is Brazilian Peppertree extract. In clinical studies, extract of the Brazilian Peppertree displays antimicrobial properties. 

Spectral.Lash
 Spectral Lash is a product based on advanced bio-peptides that are designed to grow and increase the length and girth of eyelash hair. The bio-peptides include SymPeptide 226EL, which under independent studies have shown an increase in eyelash length after 2 weeks of use. 

Marketing and Advertising 
 We have in-house graphic design and public relations departments which are supplemented by the use of third parties, to create and maintain product support literature, catalogs, mailings, web-based advertising, newsletters, editorials, advertorials, and press releases. We also target specific markets by selectively marketing our products in partnership with distribution partners that we believe reach our potential customers.

As retail salons, specialty retailers and pharmacies are an important source of revenue generation, we provide these outlets with educational materials and training and other marketing support services. We believe the relationships that stylists and salespersons have with their clients create an opportunity for such persons to recommend our products to their customers as compared to customers simply choosing our products from a shelf in retail stores. In addition, since the stylist is looking at the hair line on a regular basis, we feel that the stylist may be the first to diagnose hair loss. Early detection has the highest rate of successful treatment and therefore stylists can significantly improve the quality of life for many of their clients while also generating revenues for their respective salon or store.

Compounders and Suppliers 
 We primarily use contracted third parties to compound our products. During 2015 and 2016, we contracted with two compounders for the compounding of our products. We engage these compounders on a per order basis, without long term contracts. The third party compounders are responsible for receipt and storage for a portion of raw material, compounding and labeling of our products. At present, we are dependent upon these compounders for the compounding of all of our products. We believe at the present time we will be able to obtain the quantity of products and supplies we will need to meet orders. We purchase all of our raw materials from several third-party suppliers pursuant to purchase orders without any long-term agreements. We do not rely on any principal suppliers, although during 2015 and 2016, we had two suppliers that each provided in excess of 10% of our materials. During 2015 and 2016, we have purchased raw materials from over 30 suppliers. In the event that a current supplier or compounder is unable to meet our supply or compounder requirements at some time in the future, we may suffer short-term interruptions of delivery of certain products while we establish an alternative source. While we believe alternative sources are in most cases readily available and we have established working relationships with several third party suppliers and compounders, none of these agreements are long-term. We also rely on third party carriers for product shipments, including shipments to and from our distribution facilities. We are therefore subject to the risks, including employee strikes and inclement weather, associated with our carriers ability to provide delivery services to meet our fulfillment and shipping needs. Failure to deliver products to our customers in a timely and accurate matter would harm our reputation, our business and results of operations.

We package and assemble our products internally.

Sales Channels 
 We currently sell our products to approximately 250 salons, retailers, distributors and wholesale groups. We have begun retailing our products directly to the consumer on our company website. We have established relationships with specialty retailers, spas, salons, pharmacies and distributors, the majority of which are on a purchase order basis, without long term commitments. We continue to explore relationships with retailers and distributors both nationally and abroad for all of our products. 
Distribution Agreements 
 As of December 31, 2016, we are a party to 10 distribution agreements covering approximately 30 countries throughout the world and 9 distributors covering all markets within the United States. The agreements may generally be terminated by the distributor without cause upon 30 days notice or by us in the event the distributor fails to meet certain purchase requirements. We believe that there is a need for such arrangements as identifying partners in overseas markets enables us to outsource logistical matters and such third parties also provide customer support and have a greater knowledge of local markets and customs. During 2016, one individual customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues. 
Research and Development 
 We perform our research and development (formulation development) at our executive offices and in-house laboratories. During 2015 and 2016, we expensed $154,308 and $178,034, respectively, to research and development. Currently, the Company has several new projects and products in the pipeline, and they are as follows: 

·
 Continuum line extension with 4 more products focusing on hair anti-aging, protective and repairing effects;
 ·
 Dandrene line extension with 2 more OTC products for improved management and control of dandruff;
 ·
 Trioxil line enancements with two new products for acne control;
 ·
 Several new projects for contract product development and manufacturing (private label). 

Proprietary Rights 
 Our product formulations are created in-house. We regard the protection of trademarks and other proprietary rights that we may own material to our future success and competitive position. We rely upon the combination of laws and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights. Laws and contractual restrictions, however, may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of proprietary rights or to deter others from independently formulating products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products. In October 2013, we filed two patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPO) titled Compositions and Methods for Treatment of Hair Loss for two of our formulations. This patent is currently pending with the USPO. There can be no assurance of the outcome of the patent application. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, our business could be adversely affected.

We have obtained the following U.S. trademarks: DS Laboratories, Aminexil, Revita, Spectral.DNC and Oligo.DX, Trioxil, Nanoxidil and Sigma Skin.

Regulation

The United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act regulate the purity and packaging of health and beauty aid products and fragrances in cosmetic products. Similar statutes are in effect in various states and foreign jurisdictions. Health and beauty aids are also subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with respect to matters such as advertising content and other trade practices. We believe our products are defined as cosmeceuticals. Within the skin care industry, cosmeceuticals are not clearly regulated nor recognized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In general, products like ours are treated as either cosmetics or OTC drugs, often making drug-like claims. It is possible that the FDA, which regulates the sale and marketing of our products, may request that we make certain changes to our label claims and/or remove certain ingredients from our products or take other regulatory action. We have contracted a law firm that specializes in dealing with these regulatory matters and they have advised us that our regulatory risk is low at this time. However, it should be noted that any very drastic change to our label claims could adversely affect our business. For instance, if we were forced to change Revita Hair Stimulating Shampoo to Revita Shampoo it could have a negative effect on our marketing of the product, causing a significant drop in sales volume for this product. The failure of our Company or our compounders to comply with applicable government regulations could result in product recalls that could adversely affect our relationships with our customers. 

Our products are subject to various regulatory risks both domestically and abroad. It is possible that the FDA and health agencies in other countries may take action and demand that we remove certain products from the market, remove certain ingredients, or change certain wording on our packaging that could make the products less desirable to our customers. In addition, it is possible that the FDA and other health agencies may determine that some of the products that we market as cosmetics are actually drugs (either OTC or prescription) and may demand that we apply for either an new drug application (NDA) or abbreviated new drug application) (ANDA) which could result in the removal of those products from the market and delay the sale of these products as well as a significant cost to our company. We currently believe that our products are not subject to any specific material regulations. Furthermore, we require our international distributors to satisfy regulatory compliance matters within the particular region that such distributor is selling our products. We believe the risk of regulatory action at this time is low; however, this can change at any time depending on the current FDA administration and its posture on topical skin care and hair care products. We cannot predict the extent that potentially adverse government regulations might arise from future legislation or administrative actions. Furthermore, in the event any of our products required FDA approval we cannot predict or estimate the timing or cost, or likelihood of obtaining FDA approval for such product.

Competition 
 The hair care, skin care and personal care industries are highly competitive. Many of our competitors are large, well-known companies that have considerably greater financial, sales, marketing, research and development and technical resources than our company. Additionally, these competitors have formulary capabilities that may allow them to formulate new and improved products that may compete with product lines that we develop and market. In addition, competitors may elect to devote substantial resources to marketing their products to similar outlets and may choose to develop advertising, educational and information programs like those formulated by us to support their marketing efforts. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any one or more of such developments.

Our products, in general, compete against products distributed by national and international hair care, skin care and personal care companies, including, but not limited to, Loreal and Unilever. Our competitive position is based on the foundation of developing niche products with active ingredients that may not be found in competing products. Our competitive strategy is based on our attempt to continually focus on the application of new technologies and efficiencies rather than fashions or trends.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2016, we have a total of 131 employees, of which 38 are employed in the United States and 93 are employee in Mexico.
