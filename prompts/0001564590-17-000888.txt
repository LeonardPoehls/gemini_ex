ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

Mobile Mini, Inc. - General
 We believe we are the world’s leading provider of portable storage solutions, and are committed to providing our customers with superior service and access to a high-quality and diverse fleet.  Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Evergreen Tank Solutions, Inc. (“ETS”) we are also a leading provider of specialty containment solutions in the United States (“U.S.”).  Our mission is to uphold our leadership positions in portable storage solutions to customers throughout North America and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and become the provider of choice for specialty containment products in the U.S.
Business Model
 Mobile Mini, founded in 1983, focuses on renting rather than selling our units, with rental revenues representing approximately 94% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.  We believe this strategy provides us with predictable, recurring revenue.  Additionally, our assets have long useful lives, low maintenance and generally maintain their value throughout their useful lives.  We also sell new and used units and provide delivery, installation and other ancillary products and value-added services.
 Our business is comprised primarily of two product categories:
  
- | Portable Storage Solutions
--+---------------------------

 This category consists of our container and ground level office product offerings. We offer a wide range of portable storage products in varying lengths and widths with an assortment of differentiated features such as patented locking systems, premium doors, electrical wiring and shelving. Our portable storage units provide secure, accessible storage for a diversified client base of approximately 80,000 customers across various industries, including retail and consumer services, construction, industrial, commercial and governmental. Our customers use these products for a wide variety of storage applications, including retail and manufacturing, inventory, maintenance supplies, construction materials and equipment, documents and records, household goods, and as portable offices.
  
- | Specialty Containment Solutions
--+--------------------------------

 Our specialty containment products consist primarily of liquid and solid containment units, pumps and filtration equipment. Additionally, we provide an offering to our customers of value-added services designed to enhance the efficiency of managing liquid and solid waste. The client base for our specialty containment products includes customers in specialty industries, including chemical, refinery, oil and natural gas drilling, mining and environmental.
 As of December 31, 2016, our network includes 125 portable storage locations, 19 specialty containment locations and 14 combined locations.  Included in our portable storage network are 16 locations in the U.K., where we are a leading provider, and two in Canada. Our portable storage fleet consists of approximately 211,300 units, and our specialty containment business has a fleet of approximately 12,100 units.  In the discussions below, we generally refer to our business and assets as either “portable storage” or “specialty containment.”
 Recent Strategic Transactions
 On May 9, 2016, we issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior notes due July 1, 2024 (the “2024 Notes”). The net proceeds from the sale of the 2024 Notes were used to redeem all $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 7.875% senior notes due December 1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes,” and together with the 2024 Notes, the “Senior Notes”), including related fees, interest and costs for both the redemption of the 2020 Notes and issuance of the 2024 Notes, as well as to repay a portion of the indebtedness outstanding under our Amended and Restated ABL Credit Agreement, dated December 14, 2015, with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto (the “Credit Agreement” or “revolving credit facility”).
 On May 15, 2015, we completed the divestiture of our fleet of approximately 9,400 wood mobile office units within our North American portable storage segment for a cash price of $92.0 million, less associated assumed liabilities of approximately $6.8 million.  Our business strategy is to invest in high return, low maintenance, long-lived assets.  Wood

mobile offices require more maintenance and upkeep than Mobile Mini’s steel containers and steel ground level offices, resulting in lower margins as compared to our other portable storage products, and our specialty containment products.
 On December 10, 2014, we completed the acquisition of ETS, which we refer to as the “ETS Acquisition.”  ETS operates as a separate subsidiary under the ETS name, as does its wholly owned subsidiary, Water Movers, Inc. (“Water Movers”) which primarily offers specialty pump equipment and related services.  Like Mobile Mini, ETS rents long-lived assets with low maintenance requirements.  The acquisition expands Mobile Mini’s product lines and provides significant cross-selling and expansion opportunities as well as modest costs synergies.  These operations are included in our results of operations for the periods subsequent to the acquisition date of December 10, 2014, which includes the entire twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
 Industry Overview
 Portable Storage Solutions
 The storage industry includes two principal sectors, fixed self-storage and portable storage. The fixed self-storage sector consists of permanent structures located away from customer locations to store excess household goods. We do not participate in the fixed self-storage sector.
 The portable storage sector, upon which our business focuses, differs from the fixed self-storage sector, as it brings the storage solution to the customer’s location and fulfills the need for secure storage with immediate access to the storage unit. The advantages of portable storage include convenience, immediate accessibility, and lower price. In contrast to the fixed self-storage sector, the portable storage sector is primarily used by businesses. This sector of the storage industry is highly fragmented and remains primarily local in nature. Although there are no published estimates of the size of the portable storage market, we believe the sector is expanding due to the increasing awareness of the advantages of portable storage and that portable storage units are achieving increased market share compared to other portable options because containers provide ground level access, better protection against wind or water damage, higher security and improved aesthetics when compared to certain other portable storage alternatives such as van trailers.
 Certain of our portable storage products serve the modular space industry, which includes mobile offices and other modular structures. We offer steel ground level offices either custom designed and manufactured or made from converted ISO (International Organization for Standardization) containers as well as combination steel ground level office/storage units in varying lengths and widths to serve the various requirements of our customers.
 Specialty Containment Solutions
 In the specialty containment sector services industry, we service different markets. We serve the industrial market, which is comprised mainly of chemical facilities and refineries, (the “downstream” market), and, to a lesser extent, companies engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas (the “upstream” market).  Additionally, we serve a diversified group of customers engaged in projects in the construction, pipeline and mining markets.  Downstream customers utilize our equipment and services to manage and remove liquid and solid waste generated by ongoing operating activities as well as turn-around projects and large-scale expansion projects, while upstream customers tend to rent steel tanks to store water used in well hydraulic fracturing (“fracing”).  Other customers utilize a wide variety of our products differentiated by the type of project in which they are engaged. The liquid and solid containment industry is highly fragmented, consisting principally of local providers, with a handful of regional and national providers.
Business Environment and Outlook
 Approximately 65% of our estimated combined rental revenue during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016 was derived from our North American portable storage business, 19% was derived from our specialty containment business in North America and 16% was derived from our U.K. portable storage business. Our business is subject to the general health of the economy and we utilize a variety of general economic indicators to assess market trends and determine the direction of our business.
 Based on our assessment, we expect that the majority of our end markets will continue to drive demand for our products in 2017.  In particular, construction, which represents approximately 44% of our consolidated rental revenue, is forecasted for continued growth for the next several years.  While only 2% of our consolidated rental revenue is generated by upstream oil and gas customers, the oil and gas industry is forecasted to stabilize in the near term, with potential for future growth.

Competitive Strengths
 Our competitive strengths include the following:
 Market Leader. We believe we are the world’s largest provider of portable storage solutions, and a market leader in portable storage and accommodation solutions in the U.K., where we have nearly 100% geographic coverage, and the third largest provider of specialty containment solutions in the U.S.
 The Mobile Mini brand name is associated with high quality portable storage products, superior customer service and value-added storage solutions. Similarly, within the markets and sectors served, the ETS brand name is associated with high quality containment products and services, and the Water Movers name is associated with exceptional quality pump and filtration equipment and service.  We believe we are one of a few competitors in the U.S. and the U.K. who possess the brand awareness, network of locations, customer relationships and infrastructure to compete on a national and regional basis while maintaining a strong local market presence.
 Superior, Differentiated Products and Service.  We offer a wide range of products and proprietary features, including features that provide high-levels of security. This product differentiation within the portable storage sector as well as superior service allows us to gain market share and charge premium rental rates.
 We also offer a broad range of specialty containment equipment and value-added services, which enables us to meet customers’ ongoing needs throughout the various life cycles of projects unique to the petrochemical and industrial industry.  Our comprehensive turnkey solutions to customers’ containment, storage, pumping and filtration needs drives the creation of strong long-term partnerships with our customers.
 Sales and Marketing Emphasis. We target a diverse customer base and, unlike most of our competitors, have developed sophisticated sales and marketing programs enabling us to expand market awareness of our products and generate strong organic growth. We have a dedicated commissioned sales team that is provided with our highly customized contact management system and intensive sales training programs. We manage our salespersons’ effectiveness through extensive sales call monitoring, mentoring and training programs. Our digital advertising includes paid and organic search marketing products, industry targeted content, social messaging, and industry and customer partnerships.  External market research vendors are an integral part of our sales and marketing approach.  Additionally, our Web site includes value-added features such as product video tours, payment capabilities and real time sales inquiries that enable customers to chat live with salespeople.
 National Presence with Local Service.  We have invested significant capital developing a national network of locations that serve most major metropolitan areas in the U.S. and the U.K. Our nationwide presence allows us to offer our products to larger customers who wish to centralize the procurement of portable storage and specialty containment products on a multi-regional or national basis.  We believe we will be able to leverage our national presence and infrastructure in the portable storage U.S. market to facilitate the geographic expansion of our specialty containment business.  In the field, our local managers, sales force and drivers develop and maintain critical personal relationships with customers that benefit from our wide selection of products.
 Geographic and Customer Diversification.  Our network of portable storage locations covers nearly all major markets in both the U.S. and U.K., providing us with a broad geographical reach.  Additionally, since portable storage units are used in a multitude of applications, we have established strong relationships with a well-diversified base of portable storage customers, ranging from leading Fortune 500 companies to sole proprietorships. The operation of specialty containment locations concentrated in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S. further diversifies our geographic presence and customer base.
 As a combined company, our geographically- and industry-diversified customer base reduces our susceptibility to the effects of economic downturns in any individual market and industry in which we operate. 
 Customer Service Focus. The portable storage industry is particularly service intensive. To position ourselves to understand our customers’ needs, we have trained our sales force to focus on all aspects of customer service from the sales call onward. We use Salesforce.com® as our Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”) platform to increase our responsiveness to customer inquiries and to efficiently monitor our sales force’s performance. We use a Net Promoter Score (“NPS”) system to measure customer satisfaction and loyalty through real time surveys conducted by a third party. We utilize customer feedback to drive service improvements across the Company, from our field locations to our corporate headquarters, resulting in proven success as evidenced by our best in class NPS score of 82.9% for 2016. We differentiate ourselves by providing security, convenience, product quality, broad product selection and availability, and customer service. We believe our superior customer service drives customer satisfaction and we survey our customers to ensure that we are easy to do business with.

Within the specialty containment industry, we have leveraged our broad range of products and expertise to differentiate ourselves from competitors. ETS offers a full suite of the liquid and solid containment equipment required to execute a comprehensive containment solution that often must meet stringent regulatory and technical requirements.  In addition we offer a proprietary, sophisticated technology platform that provides detailed real-time data capture, tracking and customized reporting capabilities.  This technology, which may be integrated with customers’ enterprise systems, is a unique customer service tool that enables us to develop strong, long-term relationships with our larger customers.  Many of our specialty containment customers are large, blue-chip companies.
 Customized Management Information Systems. We continue to make significant investments in the management information systems supporting our operations. Our systems enable us to optimize fleet utilization, control pricing, dispatch and track our trucks, capture detailed customer data, evaluate and approve credit applications, monitor company results, gain efficiencies in internal control compliance, and support our growth by projecting near-term capital needs. Our customized management information systems provide insight into estimating our forward-looking market potential by territory.  This enables us to be more proactive and to respond timely to drive specific revenue streams.  Field employees and decision makers at all levels have access to real-time information about the business. In addition, we are able to capture relevant customer demographic and usage information, which we use to target new customers within our existing and new markets. These capabilities result in a competitive advantage over smaller, less sophisticated local and regional competitors.
Business Strategy
 Our strategic goal is to accelerate rental revenue growth and expand our operating margins by leveraging our infrastructure, focusing on higher returning assets and driving continuous improvements in efficiency.  To achieve this goal, we intend to continue execution of the following strategies:
 Focus on Core Rental Business with Higher Returning Assets. Our rental business provides predictable recurring revenue and high margins.  We are constantly evaluating our portfolio of product offerings to ensure our capital is invested in products that provide optimal returns. For example, during 2015 we made the strategic decision to divest our wood mobile offices, which required significantly more resources to repair, rent and prepare for rental than our other products.
 Generate Strong Organic Growth. We focus on increasing market penetration and gaining additional revenues from existing customers as well as gaining new customers through sophisticated sales and marketing programs aimed at increasing brand recognition, expanding market awareness of the uses of portable storage and differentiating our superior products from those of our competitors.
 Opportunistic Geographic Expansion. We believe we have attractive expansion opportunities in new or underserved markets in North America where we believe demand for portable storage units is underdeveloped.  During the three years ending December 31, 2016, we have completed an aggregate of 13 portable storage acquisitions, which has enabled us to enter new markets, as well as establish new customers in existing markets.  We expect to continue to execute on opportunistic acquisitions in the future.  We also have a proven strategy to enter markets by migrating available fleet to new markets that can be serviced by nearby full-service field locations. From these start-up operational yards, we are able to redeploy existing available fleet, allowing for cost effective new location openings with minimal capital expenditures. We also believe we have the opportunity to geographically expand the markets in which we offer specialty containment products.
 Innovative Product Offering. Our wide offering of products with varying features expands the applications and overall market for our portable storage products. Within our specialty containment products, we offer one of the broadest ranges of services and containment equipment in the industry complemented by an assortment of pumps and filtration units designed to allow us to partner with customers through every project stage.  We believe that our rental products can continue to generate substantial demand throughout North America and the U.K.
 Opportunities for Cross-selling and Expansion. The ETS Acquisition has allowed us to leverage the combination of Mobile Mini’s portable storage national presence with ETS’ specialty containment expertise to grow revenue by providing new products and services to existing Mobile Mini customers, and by expanding the geographic reach of our specialty containment products to serve customers previously outside of ETS’ historic service area.  Additionally, our significant presence in downstream markets, particularly in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S, has allowed us to leverage established, long-term specialty containment relationships for their portable storage needs.

Increase Fleet Utilization. We are focused on increasing utilization through improving sales representatives’ productivity and expanding our sales force and increasing the market’s awareness of our products.  Increasing utilization will result in higher rental margins and reduce capital expenditure requirements to meet growth.
 Drive Profitability of Existing Locations.  We have established key performance indicators to optimize profitability at individual locations and incentivize local management teams based on the performance of their branch.  We also compare results across locations and regions to identify areas of opportunity for growth or for increased efficiencies.
 Continuous Improvement in Our Systems.  We have made significant investments in our management information systems supporting our operations and believe these systems give us a competitive advantage. In the second quarter of 2016, we began executing our new SAP® Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system. This system is a scalable platform to support future growth.

Product Lives and Durability
 We rent containers and equipment that have been in our fleet for various lengths of time at similar rates, without regard to the age of the unit.  As such, we have no need for a systematic program to sell rental fleet units as they age.  Generally, sales from our fleet occur due to a particular customer need, having fleet in excess of rental demand at a particular location, or damage beyond economical repair for rental purposes.
 Third-party appraisals on our rental fleet are required by our lenders on a regular basis. The appraisals typically report no difference in the value of the unit due to the age or length of time it has been in our fleet.  These appraisals are used to calculate our available borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Based in part upon our lender’s third-party appraiser who evaluated our fleet as of September 30, 2015, management estimates that the net orderly liquidation appraisal value of December 31, 2016 was approximately $1.1 billion.  Our net book value for this fleet as of December 31, 2016 was $950.1 million.
 Portable Storage Solutions
 Steel containers have a long useful life with no technical obsolescence. Our steel portable storage containers and steel ground level offices have estimated useful lives of 30 years from the date we build or acquire and remanufacture them, with residual values of 55%. We maintain our steel containers on a regular basis by removing rust, painting them with rust inhibiting paint, plug-welding holes, and occasionally replacing the wooden floor or a rusted steel panel. Repainting the outside of storage units is the most common maintenance item.  A properly maintained container is essentially in the same condition as when initially remanufactured.
Specialty Containment Solutions
 When purchased new, our steel tanks and stainless steel tank trailers have estimated useful lives of 25 years, dewatering and roll-off boxes have useful lives ranging from 15 to 20 years and our pumps and filtration equipment have estimated lives of 7 years.  We do not assume any residual value at the end of the assets’ useful lives.  There is a limited secondary market for specialty containment products. We have outlined a stringent quality control and maintenance program to ensure that only equipment of the highest quality is released to the field. Each container undergoes a thorough visual inspection, hydro-testing and ultrasonic thickness testing to identify maintenance requirements.  Tank maintenance includes repainting with rust inhibiting paint, replacing interior liners, and repairing valves, gaskets and rails. This periodic maintenance keeps the specialty containers in essentially the same condition as when initially purchased and is designed to maintain the units’ value.
 9

Depreciation
 We depreciate our rental fleet using the straight-line method over each unit’s estimated useful life, after the date we place the unit in service, and the units are depreciated down to their estimated residual values, if any.  Assets obtained through acquisitions are recorded at their then current fair market value and depreciated to their estimated residual value over each asset’s estimated remaining life.
Remanufacturing and Manufacturing of Portable Storage Containers
 We purchase used ISO containers from leasing companies, shipping lines and brokers. These containers were originally built to ISO standards and are 8 feet wide, up to 9.5 feet high and 20, 40 or 45 feet long. After acquisition, we remanufacture and modify these ISO containers. Remanufacturing typically involves cleaning, removing rust and dents, repairing floors and sidewalls, painting, adding our signs and further customizing units by adding our proprietary easy opening door system and our patented locking system. Modification typically involves splitting some containers into differing lengths.  The capitalized cost for remanufactured units includes the price we paid for the unit, plus the cost of customizing units and freight charges to our location when the unit is first placed in service.  For manufactured units, cost includes our manufacturing cost, customization costs and freight charges to our location when the unit is first placed in service.  In addition, we also purchase containers that have been manufactured to our specifications and do not require remanufacturing.
 We believe we are able to procure ISO containers at competitive prices because of our volume purchasing power. If needed in the manufacturing or remanufacturing process, we purchase raw materials such as steel, vinyl, wood, glass and paint. Typically we do not have long-term contracts with vendors for the supply of any raw materials.

Operations
 Our senior management analyzes and manages our business as (i) two portable storage solutions business segments: North America and the U.K. and (ii) one specialty containment business segment. To effectively manage this business across different geographic areas, we divide these business segments into smaller management areas we call divisions, regions and locations. Each of our locations, in their respective segment, generally has similar economic characteristics covering all products rented or sold, including similar customer base, sales personnel, advertising, yard facilities, general and administrative costs and field operations management.  Further financial information by segment is provided in Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 We locate our field operations in markets with attractive demographics and strong growth prospects. Within each market, we are located in areas that allow for easy delivery of units to our customers over a wide geographic area. In addition, when cost effective, we seek locations that are visible from high traffic roads in order to advertise our products and our name. A typical branch consists of outdoor storage space for units not currently on rent and a small office.
 Each branch has a manager who has overall supervisory responsibility for all operational activities. Field location managers report to regional managers who each generally oversee multiple locations. Our regional managers, in turn, report to one of our operational senior vice presidents (called a managing director in the U.K.). Performance-based incentive bonuses are a substantial portion of the compensation for these senior vice presidents, regional managers and field managers.
 Locations have dedicated sales staff and transportation personnel that deliver and pick up units from customers. We also supplement our delivery fleet by outsourcing delivery services to independent haulers when appropriate. The locations have delivery trucks and forklifts to load, transport and unload units and a yard staff responsible for unloading and stacking units. Portable storage steel units can be stored by stacking them to maximize usable ground area. Our field locations perform preventive maintenance tasks, but outsource major repairs and other maintenance requirements either externally or to a senior repair team.
 Sales and Marketing
 Portable Storage Solutions
 We approach the market through a hybrid sales model consisting of a dedicated sales staff at our field locations as well as at our National Sales Center (“NSC”). Our field sales representatives handle local inbound calls and work to develop their branch territory and local relationships through effective networking and sales calls. The NSC handles overflow inbound calls and digital leads from new customers and initiates outbound sales campaigns to new and existing customers not serviced by sales representatives at our local locations.  Our entire staff works with our local field managers and dispatchers to ensure customers receive integrated first-class, one-call service from initial call to delivery.  We believe that offering local salesperson presence for customers, along with the efficiencies of a centralized sales operation for customers not needing a local sales contact, allows us to provide high levels of customer service and serve all of our customers in a dedicated, efficient manner.
 Our sales and marketing personnel provide information about our products to prospective customers by handling inbound calls and initiating outbound marketing calls. We have ongoing sales and marketing training programs covering all aspects of rental and customer service. Our field locations communicate with one another and with corporate headquarters through our ERP system and our CRM platform, Salesforce.com®. This centralization of information enables the sales team to share leads and other information and permits management to monitor and review sales and rental productivity on a location-by-location basis. We improve our sales efforts by recording and rating the sales calls made and received by our trained sales force. Our sales personnel are compensated largely on a commission basis.
 Our nationwide presence in the U.S. and the U.K. allows us to offer our products to larger customers who wish to centralize the procurement of portable storage on a multi-regional or national basis. Within our portable storage business, we are well equipped to meet these customers’ needs through our National Account Program, which centralizes and simplifies the procurement, rental and billing process for those customers.  Our largest customers tend to participate in our National Account Program. We provide our national account customers with service guarantees, which assure them they will receive the same superior customer service and access to high quality, diverse fleet from any of our field locations. This program has helped us succeed in leveraging customer relationships developed at one location across our entire network of locations.
 We focus a significant portion of our marketing expenditures on digital initiatives for both existing and potential customers. We also use targeted direct email and digital programs to build brand awareness by communicating market

 Specialty Containment Solutions
 Each specialty containment branch is responsible for targeting potential new customers in the branch’s service area and to be available to respond to customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  The branches are supported by a corporate team, including a sales and marketing department, business development representatives and national account management.  Branch managers and business development representatives work with customers to design customized solutions and identify new service and product applications.  National account management maintains contractual relationships with numerous blue-chip customers and coordinates the provision of services to customers with locations across multiple areas.  Our sales personnel are compensated largely on a commission basis.
 Within our specialty containment business we utilize an advanced prospect and customer management software package across our sales force and branch network, providing enhanced visibility and tracking on all prospective customer accounts.  Personnel have access to real-time critical customer information regardless of location.  This access facilitates targeted marketing and sharing of relevant customer information across branches.

Rental Terms
 Portable Storage Solutions
 We enter into contracts with our portable storage customers based on a monthly rate.  The rental continues until cancelled by the customer or the Company. On average, the steel storage containers on rent at December 31, 2016, have been in place for 30 months, and the steel ground level offices on rent at December 31, 2016 have been in place for 14 months. Our rental contracts provide that the customer is responsible for the cost of delivery and pickup and specify that the customer is liable for any damage done to the unit beyond ordinary wear and tear. Customers may purchase a damage waiver from us to avoid damage liability in certain circumstances, which provides us with an additional source of recurring revenue. Customer possessions stored within a portable storage unit are the responsibility of that customer.
Specialty Containment Solutions
 Our specialty containment rental contracts typically offer daily, weekly or monthly rates. The rental duration varies widely by application, and the rental continues until the unit is returned in clean condition to us. Rental contracts specify that the customer is responsible for carrying commercial general liability insurance, is liable for any damage to the unit beyond ordinary wear and tear, and for all materials the customer contains in rented equipment. The customer is contractually responsible for the cost of delivery and pickup, as well as thoroughly emptying and cleaning the equipment before return.  
Competition
 In all segments, we face competition from local and regional companies, as well as national companies, in substantially all of our current markets. We compete with several large national and international companies in our ground level office product line. Our competitors include lessors of storage units, mobile offices, van trailers and other structures used for portable storage. We also compete with conventional fixed self-storage facilities. In our portable storage segment, we compete primarily in terms of security, convenience, product quality, broad product selection and availability, rental rates and customer service. In our core portable storage business, our largest competitors are Algeco Scotsman, PODS, Pac-Van,

1‑800-PACK-RAT, Haulaway Storage Containers, ModSpace, McGrath RentCorp, and Wernick Hire, along with other national, regional and local companies. In our specialty containment business we compete based on factors including:  quality and breadth of equipment, technical applications expertise, knowledgeable and experienced sales and service personnel, on-time delivery and proactive logistics management, geographic areas serviced, rental rates and customer service. Our competitors include BakerCorp, Rain For Rent and Adler Tanks.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we employed 1,998 employees, the majority of which are full time.  Of these employees, 1,583 are employed in North America and 415 are employed in the U.K.  No employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Seasonality
 Demand from our portable storage customers is somewhat seasonal. Construction customers typically reflect higher demand during months with more temperate weather, while demand for our portable storage units by large retailers is stronger from September through December because these retailers need to store more inventories for the holiday season. Our retail customers usually return these rented units to us in December and early in the following year. In the specialty containment business, demand from customers is typically higher in the middle of the year from March to October, driven by the timing of customer maintenance projects. The demand for rental of our pumps may also be impacted by weather, specifically when temperatures drop below freezing.
Environmental and Safety
 Our operations, and the operations of certain of our customers, are subject to numerous federal and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection and transportation. These laws regulate such issues as wastewater, storm water and the management, storage and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous substances.  We are not aware of any pending environmental compliance or remediation matters that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.  However, failure by us to comply with applicable environmental and other requirements could result in fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third party claims, remediation actions, and could negatively impact our reputation with customers. We have a company-wide focus on safety and have implemented a number of measures to promote workplace safety. Customers are increasingly focused on safety records in their sourcing decisions due to increased regulations to report all incidents that occur at their sites and the costs associated with such incidents.
