OVERVIEW
 
CASI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“CASI”, the “Company”) (Nasdaq: CASI) is a U.S. based biopharmaceutical company dedicated to bringing high quality, cost-effective pharmaceutical products and innovative oncology therapeutics to patients. We intend to execute our plan to become a leading pharmaceutical company with a substantial market share in China. We are headquartered in Rockville, Maryland with established China operations that are growing as we continue to further in-license or acquire products for our pipeline.
 
Our product pipeline features (1) EVOMELA®, MARQIBO®, and ZEVALIN®, all U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved drugs in-licensed from Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for China regional rights, and currently in various stages in the regulatory process for market approval in China, (2) an acquired portfolio of 25 FDA-approved abbreviated new drug applications (“ANDAs”) one ANDA that FDA tentatively approved, and three ANDAs that are pending FDA approval, from which we will prioritize a select subset for product registration and commercialization in China, (3) our proprietary drug candidate, ENMD-2076, currently in Phase 2 clinical development, and (4) CASI-001 and CASI-002, proprietary early-stage candidates in immuno-oncology in preclinical development. We believe our pipeline reflects a risk-balanced approach between products in various stages of development, and between products that we develop ourselves and those that we develop with our partners for the China regional market. We intend to continue building a significant product pipeline of high quality, cost-effective pharmaceuticals, as well as innovative drug candidates that we will commercialize alone in China and with partners for the rest of the world. For in-licensed products, the Company uses a market-oriented approach to identify pharmaceutical candidates that it believes have the potential for gaining widespread market acceptance, either globally or in China, and for which development can be accelerated under the Company’s drug development strategy.
 
Our focus is to bring high quality, cost-effective pharmaceutical products and innovative oncology therapeutics to patients. The implementation of our plans will include leveraging our resources in both the United States and China. In order to capitalize on the drug development and capital resources available in China, the Company is doing business in China through its wholly-owned China-based subsidiary that will execute the China portion of the Company’s drug development strategy, including conducting clinical trials in China, pursuing local funding opportunities and strategic collaborations, and implementing the Company’s transition to a commercial enterprise.
 
IN-LICENSED PRODUCTS FOR THE CHINA REGIONAL MARKET
 
In September 2014, we acquired from Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (together referred to as “Spectrum”) exclusive rights in greater China (including Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau) to three in-licensed oncology products, including EVOMELA® (melphalan hydrochloride for injection) approved in the U.S. primarily for use as a high-dose conditioning treatment prior to hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma, MARQIBO® (vinCRIStine sulfate LIPOSOME injection) approved in the U.S. for advanced adult Ph- acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and ZEVALIN® (ibritumomab tiuxetan) approved in the U.S. for advanced non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. A description of the products and their current status is below.
 
EVOMELA®
 
EVOMELA® is a new intravenous formulation of melphalan being investigated by Spectrum in the multiple myeloma transplant setting. The formulation avoids the use of propylene glycol, which is used as a co-solvent in the current formulation of melphalan and has been reported to cause renal and cardiac side-effects that limit the ability to deliver higher quantities of intended therapeutic compounds. The use of Captisol technology to reformulate melphalan is anticipated to allow for longer administration durations and slower infusion rates, potentially enabling clinicians to avoid reductions and safely achieve a higher dose intensity of pre-transplant chemotherapy. In March 2016, Spectrum received notification from the FDA of the grant of approval of its NDA for EVOMELA® (melphalan) for injection primarily for use as a high-dose conditioning treatment prior to hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma. We have initiated the regulatory and development process towards marketing approval for EVOMELA® in China. In December 2016, the China Food and Drug Administration (“CFDA”) accepted for review our import drug registration application for EVOMELA® and in 2017 has granted priority review of the import drug registration clinical trial application (CTA), which has completed the quality testing phase of the regulatory process and is currently in technical review by Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the CFDA as part of the regulatory process.

MARQIBO®
 
MARQIBO® is a novel, sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposome-encapsulated, formulation of vincristine sulfate, a microtubule inhibitor. MARQIBO® is approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in second or greater relapse or whose disease has progressed following two or more anti-leukemia therapies. We have initiated the regulatory and development process towards marketing approval for MARQIBO in China. In January 2016, the CFDA accepted for review our import drug registration application for MARQIBO® which currently is in the quality testing phase of the regulatory review.
 
ZEVALIN®
 
ZEVALIN® injection for intravenous use is a CD20-directed radiotherapeutic antibody. It is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory, low-grade or follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). ZEVALIN® is also indicated for the treatment of patients with previously untreated follicular non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma who achieve a partial or complete response to first-line chemotherapy. ZEVALIN® therapeutic regimen consists of two components: rituximab, and Yttrium-90 (Y-90) radiolabeled ZEVALIN® for therapy. ZEVALIN® builds on the combined effect of a targeted biologic monoclonal antibody augmented with the therapeutic effects of a beta-emitting radioisotope. Since ZEVALIN® is already approved in the U.S. and marketed by Spectrum, we expect that gaining approval from local regulatory authorities for commercialization in greater China will require a shorter timeframe compared to clinical-stage drugs. In 2017, the CFDA accepted for review our import drug registration for ZEVALIN® including both the antibody kit and the radioactive Yttrium-90 component.
 
U.S. FDA ANDAs
 
On January 26, 2018 the Company acquired a portfolio of 25 U.S. FDA-approved abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), one ANDA that FDA tentatively approved, and three ANDAs that are pending FDA approval. CASI intends to select and commercialize certain products from the portfolio that offer unique market and cost-effective manufacturing opportunities in China and/or in the U.S.

ENMD-2076
 
ENMD-2076, internally developed, is an orally-active, Aurora A/angiogenic kinase inhibitor with a unique kinase selectivity profile and multiple mechanisms of action. We are currently conducting multiple Phase 2 studies of ENMD-2076, the status of which is outlined below:



Disease Indication | Status | | Sites
-----------------------------------+--------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+------
Advanced Fibrolamellar Carcinoma | U.S. sites: | Phase 2 trial enrollment completed | | · Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center · University of Colorado Cancer Center · University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center · University of California at San Francisco · Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
 | China sites: | Received CFDA approval to expand trial to China sites | | · China site(s) to be determined 
Triple-Negative Breast Cancer | U.S. sites: | Phase 2 trial enrollment completed; biomarker analysis ongoing | | · University of Colorado · Indiana University 
 | China sites: | Phase 2a trial enrollment completed | | · Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences · Additional China site(s) to be determined 

 
ENMD-2076 has received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of ovarian cancer, multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In October 2015, the Company also received orphan drug designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of HCC including FLC. In the United States, the Orphan Drug Act is intended to encourage companies to develop therapies for the treatment of diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in this country. Orphan drug designation provides us with seven years of market exclusivity that begins once ENMD-2076 receives FDA marketing approval for a specific indication. It also provides certain financial incentives that can help support the development of ENMD-2076, such as a tax credit.
 
PRECLINICAL DEVELOPMENT
 
Our primary focus is on clinical-stage and late-stage drug candidates so that we can immediately employ our U.S. and China drug development model to accelerate clinical and regulatory progress. In addition to our clinical-and late-stage approach, we have two potential drug candidates in preclinical development that we will continue to evaluate in 2018.
MANAGEMENT
 
The current senior management team includes: Dr. Wei-Wu He, Executive Chairman, Dr. Ken K. Ren, Chief Executive Officer; Cynthia W. Hu, Chief Operating Officer, General Counsel & Secretary; Dr. Alexander A. Zukiwski, Chief Medical Officer, Sara B. Capitelli, Vice President, Finance & Principal Accounting Officer; and Dr. James E. Goldschmidt, Senior Vice President, Business Development. The Company, as part of its normal operations, also has consulting relationships with a core team of experts in clinical trial design, FDA and CFDA strategy, scientific research, manufacturing and formulation, among others.

Our management team promotes and instills a corporate culture of prudent resource management, fiscal responsibility and accountability, while maintaining an environment of innovation and entrepreneurialism in order to quickly respond to opportunities and to react to any changes in market conditions and in the regulatory landscape.
 
BUsiness Development AND COMMERCIALIZATION Strategy
 
We intend to continue our path to become fully integrated with drug development and commercial operations. Our current external business development effort is concentrated on acquiring additional drug candidates through in-license and acquisitions to expand our pipeline. Our pipeline will reflect a diversified and risk-balanced set of assets that include (1) late-stage clinical drug candidates in-licensed for China regional rights, such as EVOMELA®, MARQIBO® and ZEVALIN®, (2) high quality generic pharmaceuticals, such as the portfolio of 29 ANDAs recently acquired, (3) proprietary innovative drug candidates, such as our ENMD-2076, and (4) new drug candidates under internal preclinical development. We use a market-oriented approach to identify pharmaceutical candidates that we believe have the potential for gaining widespread market acceptance, either globally or in China, and for which development can be accelerated under the Company’s drug development strategy. Although oncology is our principal clinical and commercial focus, we will be opportunistic about other pharmaceuticals that can address unmet medical needs.
 
The Company’s wholly-owned China-based subsidiary is executing the China portion of our drug development strategy, including conducting clinical trials in China, pursuing local funding opportunities and strategic collaborations, and implementing our plan for accelerated development and commercialization in the China market.
 
RELATIONSHIPS RELATING TO CLINICAL PROGRAMS
 
Contract Manufacturing. Clinical trial materials for EVOMELA®, MARQIBO®, and ZEVALIN® are supplied by our partner Spectrum and its contract manufacturers. We anticipate that the manufacturing for our newly acquired ANDA portfolio will be through new contract manufacturers located in China and outside of the U.S. after technology transfer. The manufacturing efforts for the production of our clinical trial materials for ENMD-2076 are performed by contract manufacturing organizations. Established relationships, coupled with supply agreements, have secured the necessary resources to supply clinical materials for our clinical development program. We believe that our current strategy of outsourcing manufacturing is cost-effective and allows for the flexibility we require.
Sponsored Research Agreements. To support development efforts, we may enter into sponsored research agreements with outside scientists to conduct specific projects. Under these agreements, we have secured the rights to intellectual property and to develop under exclusive license any discoveries resulting from these collaborations. The funds, if any, we provide in accordance with these agreements partially support the scientists’ laboratory, research personnel and research supplies.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 
We generally seek patent protection for our technology and product candidates in the United States, Canada, China and other key markets.  The patent position of biopharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions.  Our success will depend, in part, on whether we can: (i) obtain patents to protect our own products; (ii) obtain licenses to use the technologies of third parties, which may be protected by patents; (iii) protect our trade secrets and know-how; and (iv) operate without infringing the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others.
 
With regard to our in-licensed drug candidates (EVOMELA®, MARQIBO®, and ZEVALIN®), we have acquired exclusive licenses to intellectual property to enable us to develop and commercialize the drug candidates in our commercial markets.
 
With respect to ENMD-2076, we directly own 22 granted patents or allowed patent applications (including 2 granted United States patents, 1 granted Chinese patent, and 18 granted patents and 1 additional pending patent application in Brazil).  The patent term for U.S. Patent No. 7,563,787 will expire March 5, 2027, assuming all maintenance fees are paid.  If and when the FDA approves ENMD-2076, this patent term may be extended.  The patent terms of our granted patents (including any patents issuing from our pending patent applications) in other countries will expire September 29, 2026, assuming all annuities are paid and not considering any term extensions for regulatory approval that might be available. We also directly own two pending U.S. provisional applications directed to treatment methods using ENMD-2076.

We have pending trademark applications for CASI and CASI PHARMACEUTICALS.
 
We review and assess our portfolio on a regular basis to secure protection and to align our patent strategy with our overall business strategy. 
 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
 
Our development, manufacture, and potential sale of therapeutics in the United States, China and other countries are subject to extensive regulations by federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorities.
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates product candidates being developed as drugs or biologics. New drugs are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), and biological products, in addition to being subject to certain provisions of the FFDCA, are regulated under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). We believe that the FDA will regulate the products currently being developed by us or our collaborators as new drugs. Both the FFDCA and PHSA and corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising and other promotion of biologics or new drugs, as the case may be. FDA clearances must be obtained before clinical testing, and approvals must be obtained before marketing of biologics or drugs.
 
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates or any future product candidates we may develop. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 
Preparing drug candidates for regulatory approval has historically been a costly and time-consuming process. Generally, in order to gain FDA permission to test a new agent, a developer first must conduct preclinical studies in the laboratory and in animal model systems to gain preliminary information on an agent’s effectiveness and to identify any safety problems. The results of these studies are submitted as a part of an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for a drug or biologic, which the FDA must review before human clinical trials of an investigational drug can begin. In addition to the known safety and effectiveness data on the drug or biologic, the IND must include a detailed description of the clinical investigations proposed. Based on the current FDA organizational structure, ENMD-2076 is regulated as a new chemical entity by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Generally, as new chemical entities like our small molecules are discovered, formal IND-directed toxicology studies are required prior to initiating human testing. Clinical testing may begin 30 days after submission of an IND to the FDA unless FDA objects to the initiation of the study or has outstanding questions to discuss with the IND sponsor.
 
In order to commercialize any drug or biological products, we or our collaborators must sponsor and file an IND and conduct clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness necessary to obtain FDA approval of such products. For studies conducted under INDs sponsored by us or our collaborators, we or our collaborators will be required to select qualified investigators (usually physicians within medical institutions) to supervise the administration of the products, test or otherwise assess patient results, and collect and maintain patient data; monitor the investigations to ensure that they are conducted in accordance with applicable requirements, including the requirements set forth in the general investigational plan and protocols contained in the IND; and comply with applicable reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

Clinical trials of drugs or biologics are normally done in three phases, although the phases may overlap. Phase 1 trials for drug candidates to be used to treat cancer patients are concerned primarily with the safety and preliminary effectiveness of the drug, involve a small group ranging from 15 - 40 subjects, and may take from six months to over one year to complete. Phase 2 trials normally involve 30 - 200 patients and are designed primarily to demonstrate effectiveness in treating or diagnosing the disease or condition for which the drug is intended, although short-term side effects and risks in study subjects whose health is impaired may also be examined. Phase 3 trials are expanded clinical trials with larger numbers of patients which are intended to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to gather additional information for proper dosage and labeling of the drug. Phase 3 clinical trials generally take two to five years to complete, but may take longer. The FDA receives reports on the progress of each phase of clinical testing, as well as reports of unexpected adverse experiences occurring during the trial. The FDA may require the modification, suspension, or termination of clinical trials, if it concludes that an unwarranted risk is presented to patients, or, in Phase 2 and 3, if it concludes that the study protocols are deficient in design to meet their stated objectives.
 
If clinical trials of a new drug candidate are completed successfully, the sponsor of the product may seek FDA marketing approval. If the product is classified as a new drug, an applicant must file a New Drug Application (NDA) with the FDA and receive approval before marketing the drug commercially. The NDA must include detailed information about the product and its manufacturer and the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials. Generic drugs, which are therapeutic equivalents of existing brand name drugs, require the filing of an ANDA. An ANDA does not, for the most part, require clinical studies since safety and efficacy have already been demonstrated by the product originator. However, the ANDA must provide data to support the bioequivalence of the generic drug product. User fees must be paid with submission of applications for non-orphan products in order to support the cost of agency review. While such fees are not significant for ANDAs, an NDA for a non-orphan product requires a user fee of over $2.4 million.
 
The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort, and there can be no assurance that any approval will be obtained on a timely basis, if at all. The time required by the FDA to review and approve NDAs and ANDAs is variable and, to a large extent, beyond our control. Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data, the FDA may ultimately decide that an NDA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria and deny the approval. Further, the FDA may require additional clinical studies before making a decision on approval. In addition, the FDA may condition marketing approval on the conduct of specific post-marketing studies to further evaluate safety and effectiveness. Even if FDA regulatory clearances are obtained, a marketed product is subject to continuing regulatory requirements and review relating to current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, adverse event reporting, promotion and advertising, and other matters. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Discovery of previously unknown problems or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market, as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions.
 
The Generic Drug Enforcement Act of 1992 establishes penalties for wrongdoing in connection with the development or submission of an application. In general, the FDA is authorized to temporarily bar companies, or temporarily or permanently bar individuals, from submitting or assisting in the submission of applications to FDA, and to temporarily deny approval and suspend applications to market drugs under certain circumstances. In addition to debarment, the FDA has numerous discretionary disciplinary powers, including the authority to withdraw approval of an application or to approve an application under certain circumstances and to suspend the distribution of all drugs approved or developed in connection with certain wrongful conduct. The FDA may also withdraw product approval or take other corrective measures if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety or efficacy questions are raised after the product reaches the market.
 
Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the product. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory requirements, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates and any future product candidates we may develop. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct.

Healthcare Regulation
 
Federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, also apply to our business. If we fail to comply with those laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits. among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; and federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent. Additionally, we are subject to state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of whether the payer is a federal healthcare program, and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicate compliance efforts.
 
Numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. In addition, most healthcare providers who are expected to prescribe our products and from whom we obtain patient health information, are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we obtain and/or disclose individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity, including healthcare providers, in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states requiring security breach notification. These laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business.
 
In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the PPACA, created a federal requirement under the federal Open Payments program, that requires certain manufacturers to track and report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, annually certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year. In addition, there are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
 
For those marketed products which are covered in the United States by the Medicaid programs, we have various obligations, including government price reporting and rebate requirements, which generally require products be offered at substantial rebates/discounts to Medicaid and certain purchasers (including “covered entities” purchasing under the 340B Drug Discount Program). We are also required to discount such products to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, under which additional laws and requirements apply. These programs require submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and the guidance governing such calculations is not always clear. Compliance with such requirements can require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources, but failure to properly calculate prices, or offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial penalties.

China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA)
 
We are also subject to regulation and oversight by different levels of the food and drug administration in China, in particular, the CFDA. For clinical-stage product candidates, our development activities in China can follow two purposes: (1) to obtain clinical data to support our global FDA-regulated trials as is the case for our proprietary ENMD-2076, and (2) to obtain clinical data to support local registration with the CFDA. For late-stage product candidates that we in-license for greater China rights, such as EVOMELA®, MARQIBO®, and ZEVALIN®, our development activities in China are to secure marketing approval from CFDA by conducting import drug registration. The “Law of the PRC on the Administration of Pharmaceuticals,” as amended on February 28, 2001, provides the basic legal framework for the administration of the production and sale of pharmaceuticals in China and covers the manufacturing, distributing, packaging, pricing and advertising of pharmaceutical products in China. Its implementation regulations set out detailed implementation rules with respect to the administration of pharmaceuticals in China. We are also subject to other PRC laws and regulations that are applicable to manufacturers and distributors in general.
 
Product Manufacturing. For the registration of locally manufactured drugs, both drug substance and drug product need to be manufactured in China through either a self-owned facility or a contract manufacturing organization. The study drug to be used for clinical trials must be manufactured in compliance with CFDA Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines. A domestic manufacturer of pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) must obtain the drug manufacturing license and the GMP certification to produce pharmaceutical products and API for marketing in China. GMP certification criteria include institution and staff qualifications, production premises and facilities, equipment, raw materials, hygiene conditions, production management, quality controls, product distributions, maintenance of sales records and manner of handling customer complaints and adverse reaction reports. Both the drug manufacturing license and the GMP certificate is valid for five years, and must be renewed at least six months before its expiration date. A manufacturer is required to obtain GMP certificates to cover all of its production operations.
 
In addition, before commencing business, a pharmaceutical manufacturer must also obtain a business license from the relevant administration for industry and commerce.
 
Preclinical Research and Clinical Trials. For an investigational new drug application, a clinical trial approval issued from the CFDA is required to conduct clinical trials. Chemical generics, on the other hand, only need to undergo bioequivalent studies upon a filing for record with the CFDA. In order to apply for a clinical trial application approval to support local registration in China, a pharmaceutical company is required to conduct a series of preclinical research including research on chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology and pharmacokinetics of pharmaceuticals. This preclinical research should be conducted in compliance with the relevant regulatory guidelines issued by the CFDA. In particular, safety evaluation research must be conducted in compliance with China’s Good Laboratory Practice.
 
After completion of preclinical studies and obtaining the clinical trial approval from the CFDA, clinical trials are conducted in compliance with China’s Good Clinical Practice and include:
 
Phase 1 – preliminary trial of clinical pharmacology and human safety evaluation studies. The primary objective is to observe the pharmacokinetics and the tolerance level of the human body to the new medicine as a basis for ascertaining the appropriate methods of dosage.
Phase 2 – preliminary exploration on the therapeutic efficacy. The purpose is to assess preliminarily the efficacy and safety of pharmaceutical products on patients with the target indication of the pharmaceutical products and to provide the basis for the design and dosage tests for Phase 3. The dosing and methodology of research in this phase generally adopts double-blind, random methods with limited sample sizes.
Phase 3 – confirm the therapeutic efficacy. The objective is to further verify the efficacy and safety of pharmaceutical products on patients within the target indication, to evaluate the benefits and risks and finally to provide sufficient experimentally proven evidence to support the registration application of the pharmaceutical products. In general, the trial should adopt double-blind random methods with sufficient sample sizes.

Import Drug Registration or Multi Regional Clinical Trials. CFDA regulations allow foreign drug developers to conduct import drug registration or multi regional clinical trials in China for a new drug as part of a global drug development program. An International Multicenter Clinical Trial (IMCCT) Application needs to be filed with the CFDA and approval is required prior to conducting the trials.
 
In October, 2017, the CFDA released the Decision on Adjusting Items concerning the Administration of Imported Drug Registration, which includes the following key points:
 

· | If the International Multicenter Clinical Trial, or IMCCT, of a drug is conducted in China, the IMCCT drug does not need to be approved or entered into either a Phase II or III clinical trial in a foreign country, except for preventive biological products. Phase I IMCCT is permissible in China.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | If the IMCCT is conducted in China, the application for drug marketing authorization can be submitted directly after the completion of the IMCCT.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | With respect to clinical trial and market authorization applications for imported innovative chemical drugs and therapeutic biological products, the marketing authorization in the country or region where the foreign drug manufacturer is located will not be required.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | With respect to drug applications that have been accepted before the release of this Decision, if relevant requirements are met, importation permission can be granted if such applications request exemption of clinical trials for the imported drugs based on the data generated from IMCCT.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The CFDA Decision on IMCCT and the application for imported new drugs is expected to streamline and accelerate the applications for imported new drugs.
 
In order to apply for an IMCCT Application in China, a biopharmaceutical company is required to submit a comprehensive investigation new drug application package filed with foreign regulatory agency, i.e. the FDA, in a format compliant with CFDA guidance.
 
After obtaining the IMCCT approval from the CFDA, clinical trials are conducted in compliance with the both FDA/ICH and CFDA Good Clinical Practice guidelines.
 
New Drug Registration and Application. After completion of the 3 phases of clinical trials demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a pharmaceutical in its targeted indication, a New Drug Registration Application needs to be filled with the CFDA, which includes research data of chemistry, manufacturing and controls, pre-clinical studies and clinical trial report. For imported drugs, the New Drug Registration Application is also known as the Import Drug License Application.
 
Once a new drug registration approval or import drug license is received, the product can be sold nationwide in China.
 
Generic Quality Consistency Evaluation. The CFDA launched the generic quality consistency evaluation (GQCE) in August 2015, which requires generic drugs to conform to the quality standards of originator products. Except for immediate release oral solid dosage forms, manufacturers of generics need to conduct bioequivalent studies in order to establish equivalence to the originator products.
 
The first wave of GQCE focuses on 289 oral formulations of chemical drugs listed in China’s Essential Drug List. The CFDA will revoke marketing authorizations of these generic drugs if their manufacturers fail to complete the GQCE by the end of 2018 (or the end of 2021 if bioequivalent studies are required). In addition, once one generic manufacturer successfully passes the GQCE, all of the other manufacturers producing the same generic drug must complete their GQCE within three years following the first successful GQCE. Otherwise, the CFDA will not renew their respective marketing authorizations.

The launch of GQCE will significantly enhance of the bar of entry of generic manufacturers. Generics that pass the GQCE will be on a preferred list at public hospital tenders and will be entitled to a more favorable reimbursement status. Public hospitals will only be allowed to purchase from the first three generic manufacturers who pass the GQCE.
 
COMPETITION 
 
Competition in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries is intense and based significantly on scientific and technological factors, the availability of patent and other protection for technology and products, the ability and length of time required to obtain governmental approval for testing, manufacturing and marketing and the ability to commercialize products in a timely fashion. Moreover, the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology that could result in the technological obsolescence of any products that we develop.
 
We compete with many specialized biopharmaceutical firms, as well as a growing number of large pharmaceutical companies that are applying biotechnology to their operations. It is probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of unmet needs in oncology will increase. Many biopharmaceutical companies have focused their development efforts in the human therapeutics area, including oncology and inflammation, and many major pharmaceutical companies have developed or acquired internal biotechnology capabilities or made commercial arrangements with other biopharmaceutical companies. These companies, as well as academic institutions, governmental agencies and private research organizations, also compete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consultants.
 
The biopharmaceutical industry has undergone, and is expected to continue to undergo, rapid and significant technological change. Consolidation and competition are expected to intensify as technical advances in each field are achieved and become more widely known. In order to compete effectively, we will be required to continually expand our scientific expertise and technology, identify and retain capable personnel and pursue scientifically feasible and commercially viable opportunities.
 
Our competition will be determined in part by the potential indications for which our product candidates may be developed and ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. The relative speed with which we develop new products, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals, and complete the other requirements to get a pharmaceutical product on the market are critical factors in gaining a competitive advantage. We may rely on third parties to commercialize our products, and accordingly, the success of these products will depend in significant part on these third parties’ efforts and ability to compete in these markets. The success of any collaboration will depend in part upon our collaborative partners’ own competitive, marketing and strategic considerations, including the relative advantages of alternative products being developed and marketed by our collaborative partners and our competitors.
 
Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market products. In addition, many of these competitors have extensive experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials and in obtaining regulatory approvals. The existence of competitive products, including products or treatments of which we are not aware, or products or treatments that may be developed in the future, may adversely affect the marketability of products that we may develop. Our competitors’ drugs may be more effective than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing our product candidates.
 
EMPLOYEES 
 
Our work force, based in Rockville, Maryland and Beijing, China, currently consists of 49 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees. Certain of our activities, such as manufacturing and clinical trial operations, are outsourced at the present time. We may hire additional personnel, in addition to utilizing part-time or temporary consultants, on an as-needed basis. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
