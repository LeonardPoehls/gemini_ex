Item 1. Business
Overview
TEGP is a limited partnership formed in 2015 that has elected to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We were formed as part of a reorganization involving entities that were previously controlled by Tallgrass Equity to effect the initial public offering of our Class A shares of TEGP (the "TEGP IPO"), which was completed on May 12, 2015. Our sole cash-generating asset is an approximate 36.94% controlling membership interest in Tallgrass Equity. Tallgrass Equity's sole cash-generating assets consist of the direct and indirect partnership interests in TEP as described below:

• | Tallgrass Equity owns 100% of the outstanding membership interests in Tallgrass MLP GP, LLC ("TEP GP"), which owns all of the general partner interest in TEP as well as all of the TEP incentive distribution rights ("IDRs"). The general partner interest in TEP is represented by 834,391 general partner units, representing an approximate 1.14% general partner interest in TEP at February 15, 2017.


• | Tallgrass Equity owns 20,000,000 TEP common units, representing an approximately 27.41% limited partner interest in TEP at February 15, 2017.

TEP is a publicly traded, growth-oriented limited partnership formed in 2013 to own, operate, acquire and develop midstream energy assets in North America. TEP's operations are located in and provide services to certain key United States hydrocarbon basins, including the Denver-Julesburg, Powder River, Wind River, Permian and Hugoton-Anadarko Basins and the Niobrara, Mississippi Lime, Eagle Ford, Bakken, Marcellus, and Utica shale formations. TEP intends to continue to leverage its relationship with Tallgrass Development and utilize the significant experience of its management team to execute its growth strategy of acquiring midstream assets from Tallgrass Development and third parties, increasing utilization of its existing assets and expanding its systems through construction of additional assets. For more information, see "Tallgrass Development" below.
TEP's reportable business segments are:

• | Crude Oil Transportation & Logistics—the ownership and operation of a FERC-regulated crude oil pipeline system and crude oil storage and terminalling facilities;


• | Natural Gas Transportation & Logistics—the ownership and operation of FERC-regulated interstate natural gas pipelines and integrated natural gas storage facilities; and


• | Processing & Logistics—the ownership and operation of natural gas processing, treating and fractionation facilities, the provision of water business services primarily to the oil and gas exploration and production industry, and the transportation of NGLs.

TEP's Assets 
The following map shows TEP's primary assets, which consist of crude oil transportation, storage and terminalling assets, natural gas transportation, storage and processing assets and water business services assets, excluding TEP's West Texas water business services assets. Each of these assets are described in more detail below. 
Crude Oil Transportation & Logistics Segment
Pony Express. TEP currently provides crude oil transportation to customers in Wyoming, Colorado, and the surrounding regions through its 98% membership interest in Tallgrass Pony Express Pipeline, LLC ("Pony Express"). Pony Express owns an approximately 764-mile crude oil pipeline commencing in Guernsey, Wyoming, and terminating in Cushing, Oklahoma, with delivery points at the Ponca City Refinery and in Cushing, Oklahoma, and a lateral in Northeast Colorado that commences in Weld County, Colorado, and interconnects with the pipeline just east of Sterling, Colorado (the "Pony Express System"). TEP believes the Pony Express System is positioned as a low-cost, competitive "base load" transportation system with access to Bakken Shale, DJ Basin and Powder River Basin production.
The table below sets forth certain information regarding the Pony Express System as of December 31, 2016 and for the periods indicated:

Approximate Design Capacity (bbls/d) (1) | | Approximate Contractible Capacity Under Contract (1)(2) | | Weighted Average Remaining Firm Contract Life (3) | Approximate Average Daily Throughput (bbls/d)
 | Year Ended December 31, | 
 | 2016 | | 2015 | 
320,000 | | | 100 | % | 3 years | 285,507 | 236,256 | (4)

(2) | TEP is required to make no less than 10% of design capacity available for non-contract, or "walk-up", shippers. Approximately 100% of the remaining design capacity (or available contractible capacity) is committed under contract.


(3) | Based on the average annual reservation capacity for each such contract's remaining life.


(4) | Approximate average daily throughput for the three months ended December 31, 2015 was 288,362 bbls/d. Approximate average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflects the volumetric ramp-up during the year due to the construction and expansion efforts of the Pony Express lateral in Northeast Colorado and third-party pipelines with which Pony Express shares joint tariffs.

Terminals. TEP provides crude oil storage and terminalling services through TEP's 100% membership interest in Tallgrass Terminals, LLC ("Terminals"), which TEP acquired from Tallgrass Development effective January 1, 2017. Terminals owns and operates several assets providing storage capacity and additional injection points for the Pony Express System, including the crude oil terminal near Sterling, Colorado with approximately 1.3 million bbls of storage capacity (the "Sterling Terminal") and the crude oil terminal in Weld County, Colorado with four truck unloading skids capable of receiving up to 16,000 bbls per day (the "Buckingham Terminal"). Terminals also owns a 20% interest in Deeprock Development, LLC ("Deeprock Development"), which owns a crude oil terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma with approximately 2.3 million bbls of storage capacity (the "Cushing Terminal"). In addition, Terminals owns projects currently under development to provide additional storage capacity and other potential service opportunities, including approximately 550 acres in Cushing, Oklahoma and approximately 250 acres in Guernsey, Wyoming.
Natural Gas Transportation & Logistics Segment
Rockies Express Pipeline. TEP owns a 25% membership interest in Rockies Express Pipeline, LLC ("Rockies Express") which owns the Rockies Express Pipeline, a FERC-regulated natural gas pipeline system with approximately 1,712 miles of transportation pipelines, including laterals, extending from Opal, Wyoming and Meeker, Colorado to Clarington, Ohio (the "Rockies Express Pipeline") and consists of three zones:

• | Zone 1 - 328 miles of mainline pipeline from the Meeker Hub in Northwest Colorado, across Southern Wyoming to the Cheyenne Hub in Weld County, Colorado capable of transporting 2.0 Bcf/d of natural gas from west-to-east;


• | Zone 2 - 714 miles of mainline pipeline from the Cheyenne Hub to an interconnect in Audrain County, Missouri capable of transporting 1.8 Bcf/d of natural gas from west-to-east; and


• | Zone 3 - 643 miles of mainline pipeline from Audrain County, Missouri to Clarington, Ohio, which is bi-directional and capable of transporting 1.8 Bcf/d of natural gas from west-to-east and 2.6 Bcf/d of natural gas from east-to-west.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 98% of Rockies Express' revenues were generated under firm fee contracts.
The following tables provide information regarding the Rockies Express Pipeline as of December 31, 2016 and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:

(3) | Weighted by contracted capacity as of December 31, 2016. Weighted average remaining firm contract life of west-to-east contracts excludes the 0.2 Bcf/d contract with Ultra beginning December 1, 2019 as discussed under "Recent Developments" in Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. After giving effect to the Ultra contract agreement reached in January 2017, the weighted average life of the west-to-east contract lives would be approximately 5 years.


(4) | East-to-west capacity of 2.6 Bcf/d is inclusive of the Rockies Express Zone 3 Capacity Enhancement Project completed in January 2017 that added an incremental 0.8 Bcf/d of east-to-west capacity within Zone 3.

TIGT System. TEP owns a 100% membership interest in Tallgrass Interstate Gas Transmission, LLC ("TIGT"), which owns the Tallgrass Interstate Gas Transmission system, a FERC-regulated natural gas transportation and storage system with approximately 4,655 miles of varying diameter transportation pipelines serving Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska (the "TIGT System"). The TIGT System includes the Huntsman natural gas storage facility located in Cheyenne County, Nebraska. The TIGT System primarily provides transportation and storage services to on-system customers such as local distribution companies and industrial users, including ethanol plants, and irrigation and grain drying operations, which depend on the TIGT System's interconnections to their facilities to meet their demand for natural gas and a majority of whom pay FERC-approved recourse rates. For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 88% of the TIGT System's transportation revenue was generated from contracts with on-system customers.
Trailblazer Pipeline. TEP owns a 100% membership interest in Trailblazer Pipeline Company LLC ("Trailblazer"), which owns the Trailblazer Pipeline system, a FERC-regulated natural gas pipeline system with approximately 454 miles of transportation pipelines, including laterals, that begins along the border of Wyoming and Colorado and extends to Beatrice, Nebraska (the "Trailblazer Pipeline"). During the year ended December 31, 2016, substantially all of Trailblazer Pipeline's operationally available long-haul capacity was contracted under firm transportation contracts.
The following tables provide information regarding the TIGT System and Trailblazer Pipeline as of December 31, 2016 and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:

Processing & Logistics Segment
Midstream Facilities. TEP owns a 100% membership interest in Tallgrass Midstream, LLC ("TMID"), which owns and operates natural gas processing plants in Casper and Douglas, Wyoming and a natural gas treating facility at West Frenchie Draw, Wyoming (collectively, the "Midstream Facilities"). The Casper and Douglas plants currently have combined processing capacity of approximately 190 MMcf/d. The Casper plant also has an NGL fractionator with a capacity of approximately 3,500 barrels per day. The natural gas processed and treated at these facilities primarily comes from the Wind River Basin and the Powder River Basin, both in central Wyoming. TMID also owns and operates an NGL pipeline with an approximate capacity of 19,500 barrels per day that transports NGLs from a processing plant in Northeast Colorado to an interconnect with Overland Pass Pipeline, and TMID owns an NGL pipeline which was placed into service on January 1, 2017 that originates at our Douglas facility and interconnects with ONEOK's Bakken NGL Pipeline. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 99% of TEP's reserved processing capacity was subject to firm or volumetric fee contracts, with the majority of fee revenue based on the volumes actually processed. The remaining 1% was subject to commodity sensitive contracts. Each of TEP's NGL pipelines are supported by 10-year leases for 100% of their respective pipeline capacity, with the lease for the NGL pipeline in Northeast Colorado having commenced in October 2015, and the lease for the NGL pipeline from our Douglas facility having commenced on January 1, 2017.
The table below sets forth certain information regarding the Midstream Facilities as of December 31, 2016 and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:

190 | | 79 | % | | 2 years | | 103 | 122 | 152


(1) | The West Frenchie Draw natural gas treating facility treats natural gas before it flows into the Casper and Douglas plants and therefore does not result in additional inlet capacity.


(2) | Based on the average annual reservation capacity for each such contract's remaining life.

Water Solutions. TEP provides water business services through its 100% membership interest in BNN Water Solutions, LLC ("Water Solutions"). Water Solutions owns and operates a freshwater delivery and storage system and a produced water gathering and disposal system in Weld County, Colorado. Water Solutions is also the sole voting member and owns a 70% membership interest in BNN West Texas, LLC ("West Texas"), which owns a produced water gathering and disposal system in Reeves and Reagan County, Texas that is operated by Water Solutions. These systems are used to support third party exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas. Water Solutions also sources treated wastewater from municipalities in Texas and recycles flowback water and other water produced in association with the production of oil and gas in Colorado. 
The table below sets forth certain information regarding the Water Solutions assets as of December 31, 2016 and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:

Organizational Structure
Our general partner interest is held by TEGP Management, LLC, whose sole member is Tallgrass Energy Holdings. Tallgrass Energy Holdings is also the general partner of Tallgrass Development. A group of persons, which we refer to as the Exchange Right Holders, collectively own 100% of the voting power of Tallgrass Energy Holdings, all of our outstanding Class B shares and an equivalent number of Tallgrass Equity units. The Exchange Right Holders are entitled to exercise the right to exchange their Tallgrass Equity units (together with an equivalent number of Class B shares) for Class A shares at an exchange ratio of one Class A share for each Tallgrass Equity unit exchanged. The Exchange Right Holders primarily consist of Kelso, EMG, and Tallgrass KC. Tallgrass KC refers to Tallgrass KC, LLC, which is an entity owned by certain members of our and TEP's management.
While we, like TEP, are structured as a limited partnership, our capital structure and cash distribution policy differ materially from those of TEP. Most notably, (i) we have elected to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (ii) neither our general partner nor the holders of our Class B shares are entitled to receive any distributions from us and (iii) our capital structure does not include incentive distribution rights. Therefore, our distributions will be made exclusively to our Class A shares. However, holders of our Class A shares and Class B shares vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our shareholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law or our partnership agreement. The term "shares" used in this annual report refers to both the Class A shares and Class B shares representing limited partner interests in us. References to our "shareholders" refer to the holders of our Class A and Class B shares.
Our operations are conducted directly and indirectly through, and our operating assets are owned by, our subsidiaries. Our general partner is responsible for conducting our business and managing our operations. However, Tallgrass Energy Holdings effectively controls our business and affairs through the exercise of its rights as the sole member of our general partner, including its right to appoint members to the board of directors of our general partner.

The chart below shows the structure of Tallgrass Energy Holdings and its subsidiaries as of February 15, 2017 in a summary format. 
8

Tallgrass Development 
Tallgrass Development is controlled by its general partner, Tallgrass Energy Holdings, which also controls our general partner. In connection with TEP's initial public offering on May 17, 2013 (the "TEP IPO"), Tallgrass Development contributed to TEP 100% of the membership interests in TIGT and TMID. Since then, TEP has acquired the following additional assets from Tallgrass Development: (1) in April 2014, a 100% membership interest in Trailblazer, (2) in three separate transactions, the most recent of which was effective on January 1, 2016, a 98% membership interest in Pony Express, and (3) in January 2017, a 100% membership interest in NatGas and Terminals. In addition, in May 2016 Tallgrass Development assigned TEP its right to purchase a 25% membership interest in Rockies Express from a unit of Sempra U.S. Gas and Power ("Sempra") pursuant to the purchase agreement originally entered into between Tallgrass Development's wholly-owned subsidiary and Sempra in March 2016. Tallgrass Development continues to own a 50% interest in Rockies Express and a 2% interest in Pony Express.
Pursuant to an Omnibus Agreement entered into upon the closing of the TEP IPO, among TEP, TEP GP, Tallgrass Development and Tallgrass Energy Holdings (the "TEP Omnibus Agreement"), Tallgrass Development granted TEP a right of first offer to acquire certain assets held by Tallgrass Development at the time of the TEP IPO, which we refer to as the Retained Assets, if Tallgrass Development decides to sell such assets. The Retained Assets include Tallgrass Development's 50% interest in Rockies Express and Tallgrass Development's remaining 2% noncontrolling interest in Pony Express. Tallgrass Development is otherwise under no obligation to offer to sell TEP additional assets or to pursue acquisitions jointly with TEP, and TEP is under no obligation to buy any assets from Tallgrass Development or pursue any such joint acquisitions. However, given the significant economic interest in TEP held by Tallgrass Development and its affiliates, including Tallgrass Energy Holdings, we believe Tallgrass Development will be incentivized to offer TEP the opportunity to acquire the Retained Assets.
Further, in connection with the closing of the TEGP IPO, we, our general partner, Tallgrass Equity and Tallgrass Energy Holdings entered into an omnibus agreement (the "TEGP Omnibus Agreement"), that addresses the following matters: 

• | Tallgrass Equity's obligation to reimburse Tallgrass Energy Holdings and its affiliates for expenses incurred (i) on our behalf, (ii) on behalf of our general partner and (iii) for any other purposes related to our business and activities or those of our general partner, including our public company expenses and general and administrative expenses; and


• | Our use of the names "TEP" and "Tallgrass" and any associated or related marks.

Acquisitions
The acquisition of midstream assets and businesses that are strategic and complementary to TEP's existing operations constitutes an integral component of its business strategy and growth objectives. Such assets and businesses include crude oil transportation, storage and terminalling assets, natural gas transportation, storage and processing assets and water business services assets and other energy assets that have characteristics and provide opportunities similar to TEP's existing business lines and enable TEP to leverage its assets, knowledge and skill sets. Below are summaries of significant acquisitions TEP completed in 2016 and in January 2017. See Note 4 – Acquisitions to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a full discussion regarding our acquisition activities.

• | Additional Membership Interest in Pony Express. Effective January 1, 2016, TEP acquired an additional 31.3% membership interest in Pony Express in exchange for cash consideration of $475 million and 6,518,000 TEP common units (valued at approximately $268.6 million based on the December 31, 2015 closing price of our common units), issued to Tallgrass Development, for total consideration of approximately $743.6 million. The transaction increased TEP's aggregate membership interest in Pony Express to 98%.


• | Rockies Express Pipeline LLC. Effective May 6, 2016, TEP acquired a 25% membership interest in Rockies Express from Sempra for cash consideration of approximately $436 million, or an enterprise value of approximately $1.08 billion when adjusted for our proportionate share of outstanding indebtedness at Rockies Express as of the acquisition date.


• | Additional Membership Interest in Water Solutions. On July 1, 2016, TEP acquired the remaining 8% noncontrolling equity interest in Water Solutions and additional interests in Water Solutions' subsidiaries from Regency Investments I, LLC and BSEG Water Group LLC for total cash consideration of $6.0 million. Subsequent to the closing of the transaction, TEP's aggregate membership interest in Water Solutions is 100%.


• | Terminals and NatGas. Effective January 1, 2017, TEP acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in Terminals and 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in NatGas from Tallgrass Development for total cash consideration of $140 million.

Competition
All of TEP's businesses face strong competition for acquisitions and development of new projects from both established and start-up companies. Competition may increase the cost to acquire existing facilities or businesses and may result in fewer commitments and lower returns for new pipelines or other development projects. TEP's competitors may have greater financial resources than TEP possesses or may be willing to accept lower returns or greater risks. Competition differs by region and by the nature of the business or the project involved.
Additionally, pending and future construction projects, if and when brought online, may also compete with TEP's crude oil transportation, storage and terminalling services, natural gas transportation, storage and processing services and water transportation, gathering and disposal services. Further, natural gas as a fuel, and fuels derived from crude oil, compete with other forms of energy available to users, including electricity, coal, other liquid fuels and alternative energy. Increased demand for such forms of energy at the expense of natural gas or fuels derived from crude oil could lead to a reduction in demand for TEP's services. Moreover, several other factors may influence the demand for natural gas and crude oil which in turn influences the demand for TEP's services, including price changes, the availability of natural gas and crude oil and other forms of energy, the level of business activity, conservation, legislation and governmental regulations, weather, and the ability to convert to alternative fuels.
Pony Express encounters competition in the crude oil transportation business. A number of pipeline companies compete with Pony Express to service takeaway volumes in markets that Pony Express currently serves, including pipelines owned and operated by Spectra Energy, Sinclair, Plains All American, Suncor, SemGroup, Magellan Midstream Partners, Anadarko, NGL Energy Partners, Energy Transfer Partners, and Enbridge Energy Partners. Pony Express also competes with rail facilities, which can provide more delivery optionality to crude oil producers and marketers looking to capitalize on basis differentials between two primary crude oil price benchmarks (West Texas Intermediate Crude and Brent Crude), and with refineries that source barrels in areas served by Pony Express. In addition, Terminals encounters competition in the crude oil storage and terminalling business from similar facilities owned by Arc Logistics Partners LP, Magellan Midstream Partners, and NGL Energy Partners, that provide similar services near its Buckingham Terminal.
TEP's principal competitors in its natural gas transportation and storage business include companies that own major natural gas pipelines, such as Spectra Energy, Wyoming Interstate Company, LLC, Colorado Interstate Gas Company, LLC, Cheyenne Plains Gas Pipeline Company, LLC, Northern Natural Gas Company, and Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, Inc., some of whom also have existing storage facilities connected to their transportation systems that compete with TEP's storage facilities. In addition to this competition, which is primarily comprised of other pipeline companies that transport gas out of the Rocky Mountain region, Trailblazer also delivers gas into a very competitive marketplace that receives gas from the developing shale plays like the Bakken, Marcellus and Utica. As these supplies increase, it reduces the need for traditional Rockies gas production that is accessible from Trailblazer.
TEP also experiences competition in the natural gas processing business. TEP's principal competitors for processing business include other facilities that service its supply areas, such as the other regional processing and treating facilities in the greater Powder River Basin which include plants owned and operated by Kinder Morgan, Inc., which we refer to as Kinder Morgan, ONEOK Partners, LP, Western Gas Partners, LP, Williams Partners L.P. and Meritage Midstream Services II, LLC. In addition, due to the competitive nature of the liquids-rich plays in the Wind River Basin and Powder River Basin, it is possible that one of TEP's competitors could build additional processing facilities that service TEP's supply areas. Further, TEP experiences competition in the water business services. TEP's principal competitors in such business are other midstream companies, such as NGL Energy Partners, who compete with Water Solutions in areas of concentrated production activity.
Regulatory Environment 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
TEP provides open-access interstate transportation service on its natural gas transportation systems pursuant to tariffs approved by the FERC. As interstate transportation and storage systems, the rates, terms of service and continued operations of the Rockies Express Pipeline, the TIGT System and the Trailblazer Pipeline are subject to regulation by the FERC, under among other statutes, the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or NGA, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or the NGPA, and the Energy Policy Act of 2005, or EPAct 2005. The rates and terms of service on the Pony Express System are subject to regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act, or the ICA, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992. TEP provides interstate transportation service on the Pony Express System pursuant to tariffs on file with the FERC. TEP's NGL pipeline that interconnects with Overland Pass Pipeline is leased to a third party who has obtained a waiver for itself from the FERC from the tariff, filing and reporting requirements of the ICA, and TEP's NGL pipeline that interconnects with the ONEOK's Bakken NGL Pipeline is leased to a third party who is obligated to operate the leased pipeline in conformance with the ICA as a FERC regulated NGL pipeline.
10

The FERC has jurisdiction over, among other things, the construction, ownership and commercial operation of pipelines and related facilities used in the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce, including the modification, extension, enlargement and abandonment of such facilities. The FERC also has jurisdiction over the rates, charges and terms and conditions of service for the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce. The FERC's authority over interstate crude oil pipelines is less broad than its authority over interstate natural gas pipelines and includes rates, rules and regulations for service, the form of tariffs governing service, the maintenance of accounts and records, and depreciation and amortization policies.
The rates and terms for access to interstate natural gas pipeline transportation services are subject to extensive regulation and the FERC has undertaken various initiatives to increase competition within the natural gas industry. As a result of these initiatives, interstate natural gas transportation and marketing entities have been substantially restructured to remove barriers and practices that historically limited non-pipeline natural gas sellers, including producers, from competing effectively with interstate pipelines for sales to local distribution companies and large industrial and commercial customers. The FERC's regulations require, among other things, that interstate natural gas pipelines provide firm and interruptible transportation service on an open access basis, provide internet access to current information about available pipeline capacity and other relevant information, and permit pipeline shippers under certain circumstances to release contracted transportation and storage capacity to other shippers, thereby creating secondary markets for such services. The result of the FERC's initiatives has been to eliminate interstate natural gas pipelines' historical role of providing bundled sales service of natural gas and to require pipelines to offer unbundled storage and transportation services on a not unduly discriminatory or preferential basis. The rates for such transportation and storage services are subject to the FERC's ratemaking authority, and the FERC exercises its authority by applying cost-of-service principles to limit the maximum and minimum levels of tariff-based recourse rates; however, it also allows for discounted or negotiated rates as an alternative to cost-based rates and may grant market-based rates in certain circumstances, typically with respect to storage services. The FERC regulations also restrict interstate natural gas pipelines from sharing certain transportation or customer information with marketing affiliates and require that the transmission function personnel of interstate natural gas pipelines operate independently of the marketing function personnel of the pipeline or its affiliates.
FERC; Market Behavior Rules; Posting and Reporting Requirement; Other Enforcement Authorities
EPAct 2005, among other matters, amended the NGA to add an anti-manipulation provision that makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior in contravention of rules and regulations to be prescribed by the FERC and, furthermore, provides the FERC with additional civil penalty authority. The FERC adopted rules implementing the anti-manipulation provision of EPAct 2005 that make it unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC to (1) use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person.
These anti-manipulation rules apply to interstate gas pipelines and storage companies and intrastate gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted "in connection with" gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. EPAct 2005 also amended the NGA and the NGPA to give the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes of more than $1 million per day per violation. In connection with this enhanced civil penalty authority, the FERC issued policy statements on enforcement to provide guidance regarding the enforcement of the statutes, orders, rules and regulations it administers, including factors to be considered in determining the appropriate enforcement action to be taken. Should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rule, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines, including the disgorgement of unjust profits.
EPAct 2005 also amended the NGA to authorize the FERC to facilitate price transparency in markets for the sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce. The FERC has taken steps to enhance its market oversight and monitoring of the natural gas industry by adopting rules that (1) require buyers and sellers of annual quantities of 2,200,000 MMBtu or more of gas in any year to report by May on the aggregate volumes of natural gas they purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year; (2) report whether they provide prices to any index publishers and, if so, whether their reporting complies with the FERC's policy statement on price reporting; and (3) increase the Internet posting obligations of interstate pipelines.
In addition, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, is directed under the Commodities Exchange Act, or CEA, to prevent price manipulations for the commodity and futures markets, including the energy futures markets. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or Dodd-Frank Act, in July 2010 and other authority, the CFTC has adopted anti-market manipulation regulations that prohibit fraud and price manipulation in the commodity and futures markets. The CFTC also has statutory authority to seek civil penalties of up to the greater of more than $1 million or triple the monetary gain to the violator for violations of the anti-market manipulation sections of the CEA.
11

Further, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, has the authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTCA, and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, or EISA, to regulate wholesale petroleum markets. The FTC has adopted anti-market manipulation rules, including prohibiting fraud and deceit in connection with the purchase or sale of certain petroleum products, and prohibiting omissions of material information which distort or are likely to distort market conditions for such products. In addition to other enforcement powers it has under the FTCA, the FTC can sue violators under EISA and request that a court impose fines of more than $1 million per violation per day. 
The FERC also has the authority under the ICA to regulate the interstate transportation of petroleum on common carrier pipelines, including whether a pipeline's rates or rules and regulations for service are "just and reasonable." Among other enforcement powers, FERC can order prospective rate changes, suspend the effectiveness of rates, and order reparations for damages. In addition, the ICA imposes potential criminal liability for certain violations of the statute. 
Certain Outstanding Notices Issued by the FERC
FERC Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Revisions to Indexing Policies and Page 700 of FERC Form No. 6, Docket No. RM17-1-000
On November 2, 2016, the FERC issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, under which the FERC is proposing changes to its regulation of oil pipelines in two different areas: (1) its policies regarding the permissible scope of rate increases based on its annual issuance of changes to the generic oil pipeline index, based on specific pipelines' earnings or their specific changes to costs; and (2) the reporting requirements for page 700 of FERC Form No. 6, Annual Report of Oil Pipeline Companies. The FERC's Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking does not propose specific regulations, and may be followed by a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing specific regulations or a Policy Statement announcing new or changed policies. Initial comments to such notice were required to be submitted by January 19, 2017. 
Inquiry Regarding the FERC's Policy for Recovery of Income Tax Costs
On December 15, 2016, the FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry regarding the FERC's policy for recovery of income tax costs in pipeline cost of service rates. The FERC is seeking comments regarding how to address any double recovery resulting from the FERC's current income tax allowance and rate of return policies. This Notice of Inquiry follows the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit holding in United Airlines, Inc., et al. v. FERC that the FERC failed to demonstrate that there is no double recovery of taxes for a partnership pipeline as a result of the income tax allowance and return on equity determined pursuant to the discounted cash flow methodology. The FERC has set a deadline for initial comments to be submitted by March 8, 2017.
Certain of our Dockets at the FERC
Rockies Express Zone 3 Capacity Enhancement Project
On March 31, 2015 in Docket No. CP15-137-000, Rockies Express filed with the FERC an application for authorization to construct and operate (1) three new mainline compressor stations located in Pickaway and Fayette Counties, Ohio and Decatur County, Indiana; (2) additional compression at one existing compressor station in Muskingum County, Ohio; and (3) certain ancillary facilities. As proposed, the facilities would increase the Rockies Express Zone 3 east-to-west mainline capacity by 0.8 Bcf/d. Pursuant to the FERC's obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act, FERC staff issued an Environmental Assessment for the project on August 31, 2015. On February 25, 2016, the FERC issued a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity authorizing Rockies Express to proceed with the project. On March 14, 2016, Rockies Express commenced construction of the project facilities. The project was placed in-service for the 0.8 Bcf/d on January 6, 2017.
Rockies Express Seneca Lateral Facilities Conversion
On March 2, 2015 in Docket No. CP15-102-000, Rockies Express filed with the FERC an application for (1) authorization to convert certain existing and operating pipeline and compression facilities located in Noble and Monroe Counties, Ohio (Seneca Lateral Facilities described in Docket Nos. CP13-539-000 and CP14-194-000) from NGPA Section 311 authority to NGA Section 7 jurisdiction, and (2) issuance of a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing Rockies Express to operate and maintain the Seneca Lateral Facilities. On April 7, 2016, the FERC issued a Certificate to Rockies Express granting its requested authorizations and on June 1, 2016 Rockies Express commenced NGA service on the Seneca Lateral.

TIGT 2015 General Rate Case Filing
On October 30, 2015, TIGT filed a general rate case with the FERC pursuant to Section 4 of the NGA. The rate case proposed a general system-wide increase in the maximum tariff rates for all firm and interruptible services offered by TIGT. In addition, TIGT proposed certain changes to the transportation rate design of its system to replace the current rate zone structure with a single "postage stamp" rate. TIGT also proposed new incremental charges, including (i) a charge for deliveries made to points without certain electronic flow measurement equipment, and (ii) a Cost Recovery Mechanism ("CRM") charge to completely or partially reimburse TIGT for certain expenses and costs it incurs to comply with anticipated new PHMSA and EPA regulations. TIGT also proposed to replace its fixed fuel and lost and unaccounted for ("FL&U") charge with a FL&U tracker that would compensate TIGT for its actual FL&U expenses and adjust each year to reflect the previous period's under/over collection and the forecasted FL&U expense for the upcoming period. TIGT also proposed to implement a power cost tracker to recover the actual power costs incurred by TIGT to power its compressors. Finally, TIGT proposed certain revisions to its FERC Gas Tariff addressing a number of other rate and non-rate matters. Under the NGA and the FERC's regulations, TIGT's shippers and other interested parties, including the FERC's Trial Staff, have a right to challenge any aspect of TIGT's rate case filing. Accordingly, numerous TIGT customers protested aspects of TIGT's NGA Section 4 rate filing.
On November 30, 2015, the FERC issued an order accepting and suspending the proposed rates and a majority of the proposed tariff records to be effective upon motion May 1, 2016, subject to refund, certain modifications to TIGT's proposed CRM charge, and the outcome of an evidentiary hearing before a FERC Administrative Law Judge (the "TIGT Suspension Order"). In the TIGT Suspension Order, the FERC also accepted two tariff records related to force majeure events and reservation charge crediting to be effective December 1, 2015, subject to certain modifications. On December 21, 2015, TIGT made a compliance filing with the FERC to modify TIGT's proposed CRM charge and update the tariff records related to force majeure events and reservation charge crediting as directed by the FERC in the TIGT Suspension Order. No comments or protests were filed in response to the compliance filing and the FERC accepted the compliance filing on February 1, 2016. On March 31, 2016, the FERC issued an order denying certain rehearing requests pertaining to the proposed CRM charge and removed from hearing the non-rate issues related to proposed pro forma tariff records, placing the non-rate issues under a separate review process, and allowing interveners further opportunity to comment on the pro forma tariff. TIGT and certain intervenors have since filed additional information and/or comments with respect to the proposed pro forma tariff. On February 3, 2017, the FERC accepted TIGT's pro forma tariff records, subject to conditions, and directed TIGT to file the actual tariff records within 30 days.
On June 8, 2016, TIGT filed an Offer of Settlement ("TIGT Rate Case Settlement") with the FERC, which resolved all issues set for hearing. On July 14, 2016, the presiding Administrative Law Judge certified the TIGT Rate Case Settlement to the FERC, finding that settlement was uncontested, presented no issues of first impression, had no FERC policy implications, and appeared to be just, reasonable and in the public interest. On November 2, 2016, the FERC issued an order approving the TIGT Rate Case Settlement, finding that it appeared to be fair and reasonable and in the public interest. The FERC also directed TIGT to file revised tariff records to implement the TIGT Rate Case Settlement, which TIGT filed, and the FERC subsequently approved on December 23, 2016. The November 2, 2016 order also terminated all matters in the TIGT rate case, apart from the non-rate issues related to the pro forma tariff which remain pending before the FERC. Per the terms of the TIGT Rate Case Settlement, TIGT is required to file a new general rate case on May 1, 2019 (provided that such rate case is not pre-empted by a pre-filing settlement), and no Supporting/Non-Contesting Participant, as defined in the TIGT Rate Case Settlement, is permitted to, inter alia, file to change the settlement rates or any other provisions set forth in the TIGT Rate Case Settlement prior to May 1, 2019.

Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration
TEP is also subject to safety regulations imposed by PHMSA, including those regulations requiring TEP to develop and maintain integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along TEP's pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in areas, which are referred to as high consequence areas, or HCAs, where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm.
13

In January 2012, the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011, or The Pipeline Safety Act of 2011, which amended the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, increased penalties for violations of safety laws and rules, among other matters, and may result in the imposition of more stringent regulations in the next few years. This legislation also requires the U.S. Department of Transportation to study and report to Congress on other areas of pipeline safety, including expanding the reach of the integrity management regulations beyond high consequence areas, but restricts the U.S. Department of Transportation from promulgating expanded integrity management rules during the review period and for a period following submission of its report to Congress unless the rulemaking is needed to address a present condition that poses a risk to public safety, property or the environment. PHMSA issued a final rule effective October 25, 2013 that implemented aspects of the new legislation. Among other things, the final rule increases the maximum civil penalties for violations of pipeline safety statutes or regulations, broadens PHMSA's authority to submit information requests, and provides additional detail regarding PHMSA's corrective action authority. In addition, the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016, or PIPES Act, reauthorized PHMSA's oil and gas pipeline programs through 2019 and gave PHMSA power to issue emergency orders upon finding an imminent hazard, required PHMSA to issue safety standards for underground natural gas storage facilities, set deadlines for conducting post-inspection briefings and making findings, required liquid pipeline operators to undertake new safety measures, and required certain updates to the PHMSA website.
Additionally, PHMSA is also currently considering changes to its regulations. On December 14, 2016, PHMSA issued an interim final rule, or IFR, that addresses safety issues related to downhole facilities, including well integrity, well bore tubing and casing at underground natural gas storage facilities. The IFR incorporates by reference two of the American Petroleum Institute’s Recommended Practice standards and mandates certain reporting requirements for operators of underground natural gas storage facilities. Operators of natural gas storage facilities have one year from January 18, 2017, the effective date of the IFR, to implement this first set of PHMSA regulations governing underground storage fields. On January 13, 2017, PHMSA finalized new hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations. Among other things, the final rule requires additional event-driven and periodic inspections, requires the use of leak detection systems on all hazardous liquid pipelines, modifies repair criteria, and requires certain pipelines to eventually accommodate in-line inspection tools. Because the rule was finalized at the end of the Obama Administration, the rule is subject to a regulatory freeze pending review by the Trump Administration, unless exempted due to health and safety considerations. Assuming the rule survives the review process or is exempted from the regulatory freeze, the rule will become effective six months after its publication in the Federal Register, although certain provisions of the Final Rule will have longer compliance periods. Also, on April 8, 2016, PHMSA published a notice of proposed rule-making, or NPRM, addressing natural gas transmission and gathering lines. The proposed rule would include changes to existing integrity management requirements and would expand assessment and repair requirements to pipelines in areas with medium population densities (referred to as Moderate Consequence Areas or MCAs), along with other changes. This NPRM builds on an Advisory Bulletin PHMSA issued in May 2012, which advised pipeline operators of anticipated changes in annual reporting requirements and that if they are relying on design, construction, inspection, testing, or other data to determine the pressures at which their pipelines should operate, the records of that data must be traceable, verifiable and complete. Locating such records and, in the absence of any such records, verifying maximum pressures through physical testing (including hydrotesting) or modifying or replacing facilities to meet the demands of such pressures, could significantly increase our costs. TIGT continues to investigate and, when necessary, report to PHMSA the miles of pipeline for which it has incomplete records for maximum allowable operating pressure, or MAOP. We are currently undertaking an extensive internal record review in view of the anticipated PHMSA annual reporting requirements. Additionally, failure to locate such records or verify maximum pressures could result in reductions of allowable operating pressures, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. At the state level, several states have passed legislation or promulgated rulemaking dealing with pipeline safety. There can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity regulation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. Regulations, changes to regulations or an increase in public expectations for pipeline safety may require additional reporting, the replacement of some of our pipeline segments, the addition of monitoring equipment and more frequent inspection or testing of our pipeline facilities. Any repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures.
Pipeline Integrity Issues
The ultimate costs of compliance with the integrity management rules are difficult to predict. Changes such as advances of in-line inspection tools, identification of additional threats to a pipeline's integrity and changes to the amount of pipe determined to be located in HCAs or expansion of integrity management requirements to areas outside of HCAs can have a significant impact on the costs to perform integrity testing and repairs. TEP will continue pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of its existing and future pipelines as required by the U.S. Department of Transportation regulations. The results of these tests could cause TEP to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of its pipelines, which expenditures could be material.
14

From time to time, TEP's pipelines may experience integrity issues. These integrity issues may cause explosions, fire, damage to the environment, damage to property and/or personal injury or death. In connection with these incidents, TEP may be sued for damages caused by an alleged failure to properly mark the locations of its pipelines and/or to properly maintain its pipelines. Depending upon the facts and circumstances of a particular incident, state and federal regulatory authorities may seek civil and/or criminal fines and penalties and TEP may also be subject to private civil liability for such matters. 
Trailblazer
Trailblazer is currently operating at less than its current MAOP, public notice of which was first provided in June 2014. As a result of smart tool surveys in 2014, Trailblazer has identified approximately 25 - 35 miles of pipe that will likely need to be repaired or replaced in order for the pipeline to operate at its MAOP of 1,000 pounds per square inch across all segments of the Trailblazer Pipeline. Such repair or replacement will likely occur over a period of years, depending upon the remediation and repair plan implemented by Trailblazer. Segments of the Trailblazer Pipeline that require full replacement could cost as much as $2.7 million per mile and repair costs on sections of the pipeline that do not require full replacement are expected to be less on a per mile basis. The current pressure reduction is not expected to prevent Trailblazer from fulfilling its firm service obligations at existing subscription levels and to date it has not had a material adverse financial impact on us.
With respect to the approximately 25 - 35 miles of pipe that has been identified, Trailblazer completed 32 excavation digs in 2015 at an aggregate cost of approximately $1.3 million. During 2016, Trailblazer completed additional excavation digs and replaced approximately 8 miles of pipe at an aggregate cost of approximately $19.0 million. Trailblazer is currently exploring all possible cost recovery options to recover such out of pocket costs, including recovery through a general rate increase, negotiated rate agreements with its customers, or other FERC-approved recovery mechanisms.
In connection with our acquisition of the Trailblazer Pipeline, TD agreed to contractually indemnify TEP for any out of pocket costs incurred between April 1, 2014 and April 1, 2017 related to repairing or remediating the Trailblazer Pipeline, to the extent that such actions are necessitated by external corrosion caused by the pipeline's disbonded Hi-Melt CTE coating. The contractual indemnity provided by TD is capped at $20 million and is subject to an annual $1.5 million deductible. In connection with the 2016 repairs and remediation on the Trailblazer Pipeline, TEP has received $17.9 million from TD pursuant to the contractual indemnity.
Pony Express
In connection with certain crack tool runs on the Pony Express System completed in 2015 and 2016, Pony Express completed approximately $9.8 million of remediation in 2016 for anomalies identified on the Pony Express System associated with portions of the pipeline that were converted from natural gas to crude oil service, and expects to complete additional remediation in 2017 on the Pony Express System of approximately $9 million.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
General
The ownership, operation and expansion of TEP's assets are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact TEP's business activities in many ways, such as restricting the way TEP can handle or dispose of its wastes, requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions that may be caused by its operations or that are attributable to former operations, regulating future construction activities to mitigate harm to threatened or endangered species, wetlands and migratory birds, and requiring the installation and operation of pollution control or seismic monitoring equipment. The cost of complying with these laws and regulations can be significant, and TEP expects to incur significant compliance costs in the future as new, more stringent requirements are adopted and implemented. 
Failure to comply with existing environmental laws, regulations, permits, approvals or authorizations or to meet the requirements of new environmental laws, regulations or permits, approvals and authorizations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties and/or temporary or permanent interruptions in TEP's operations that could influence its business, financial position, results of operations and prospects. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. The costs and liabilities resulting from a failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could negatively affect TEP's business, financial position, results of operations and prospects. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment.
15

In addition, TEP has agreed to a number of conditions in its environmental permits, approvals and authorizations that require the implementation of environmental habitat restoration, enhancement and other mitigation measures that involve, among other things, ongoing maintenance and monitoring. Governmental authorities may require, and community groups and private persons may seek to require, additional mitigation measures in the future to further protect ecologically sensitive areas where TEP currently operates, and would operate in the future, and TEP is unable to predict the effect that any such measures would have on its business, financial position, results of operations or prospects.
TEP is also subject to the requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, or OSHA, the Pipeline Safety Act and other comparable federal and state statutes. In general, TEP expects that it may have to increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards. Such increases in expenditures could become significant over time.
Historically, TEP's total expenditures for environmental control measures and for remediation have not been significant in relation to TEP's consolidated financial position or results of operations. It is reasonably likely, however, that the long-term trend in environmental legislation and regulations will continue towards more restrictive standards. Compliance with these standards is expected to increase the cost of conducting business.
For additional information regarding Environmental, Health and Safety Matters, please read Item 1A.—Risk Factors.
Air Emissions
TEP's operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act, or CAA, and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including natural gas processing plants and compressor stations, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that TEP obtains pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions (including GHG emissions, as discussed below), obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations and/or install emission control equipment. TEP may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment and technology in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.
The EPA finalized a rule, effective August 2, 2016, under the New Source Performance Standard Program, or NSPS Program, to limit methane emissions from the oil and gas and transmission sectors. The rule sets additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulates methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry. The EPA also finalized a rule regarding the alternative criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes. Also, effective January 17, 2017 the Bureau of Land Management of the U.S. Department of the Interior, or BLM, imposed new rules to reduce venting, flaring and leaks during oil and natural gas production activities on onshore Federal and Indian lands.
Developments in GHG Regulations
Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of natural gas and products produced from crude oil, are examples of GHGs. The EPA has determined that the emission of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases contribute to the warming of the Earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes. Various laws and regulations exist or are under development that seek to regulate the emission of such GHGs, including the EPA programs to control GHG emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs. In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered, but not adopted, legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs. There have also been efforts to regulate GHGs at an international level, most recently in the Paris Agreement, which was signed on April 22, 2016 by 175 countries, including the United States. The Paris Agreement will require countries to review and "represent a progression" in their intended, nationally-determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020.
16

Because TEP's operations, including its compressor stations, emit various types of GHGs, primarily methane and carbon dioxide, such new legislation or regulation could increase its costs related to operating and maintaining its facilities. Depending on the particular new law, regulation or program adopted, TEP could be required to incur capital expenditures for installing new emission controls on its facilities, acquire permits or other authorizations for emissions of GHGs from its facilities, acquire and surrender allowances for its GHG emissions, pay taxes related to its GHG emissions and administer and manage a GHG emissions program. TEP is not able at this time to estimate such increased costs; however, as is the case with similarly situated entities in the industry, they could be significant to TEP. While TEP may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by its pipelines, such recovery of costs in all cases is uncertain and may depend on events beyond its control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the FERC and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations. Similarly, while TEP may be able to recover some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by its processing facilities, such recovery of costs is uncertain and may depend on the terms of its contracts with its customers. In addition, new laws, regulations, or programs adopted could also impact TEP's customers' operations or the overall demand for fossil fuels. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on TEP's business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.
Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing
A sizeable portion of the hydrocarbons TEP transports, processes, and stores comes from hydraulically fractured wells. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. The process typically involves the injection of water, sand and a small percentage of chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is regulated by state agencies, typically the state's oil and gas commission; however, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA and has released draft permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where the EPA is the permitting authority. A number of federal agencies, including the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy, are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. In addition, some states, including those in which TEP operates, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent disclosure and/or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. Other states, including states in which TEP operates, have restrictions on produced water storage from hydraulic fracturing operations and the operation of produced water disposal wells. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular, and in some cases, may seek to ban hydraulic fracturing entirely. Some state and local authorities have considered or imposed new laws and rules related to hydraulic fracturing, including temporary or permanent bans, additional permit requirements, operational restrictions and chemical disclosure obligations on hydraulic fracturing in certain jurisdictions or in environmentally sensitive areas. 
 If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for TEP's customers to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the volume of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that TEP's customers produce, and could thereby adversely affect TEP's revenues and results of operations.
Hazardous Substances and Waste
TEP's operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, nonhazardous and hazardous wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous waste and may impose strict joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment. TEP may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or analogous state laws, in the course of its ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released or threatened to be released into the environment.
TEP also generates wastes that are subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and comparable state laws. RCRA regulates both nonhazardous and hazardous solid wastes, but it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. It is possible that wastes resulting from TEP's operations that are currently treated as non-hazardous wastes could be designated as "hazardous wastes" in the future, subjecting TEP to more rigorous and costly management and disposal requirements. It is also possible that federal or state regulatory agencies will adopt stricter management or disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes, including natural gas wastes. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on TEP's business, financial position, results of operations and prospects or otherwise impose limits or restrictions on its operations or those of its customers.
17

In some cases, TEP owns or leases properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. Hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by TEP or on or under the locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been transported for treatment or disposal. TEP could also have liability for releases or disposal on properties owned or leased by others. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, TEP could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners and operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination.
TEP's produced water disposal operations require it to comply with the Class II well standards under the federal SDWA. The SDWA imposes requirements on owners and operators of Class II wells through the EPA's Underground Injection Control program, including construction, operating, monitoring and testing, reporting and closure requirements. TEP's disposal wells are also subject to comparable state laws and regulations. Compliance with current and future laws and regulations regarding TEP's produced water disposal wells may impose substantial costs and restrictions on its produced water disposal operations, as well as adversely affect demand for its produced water disposal services. State and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of produced water injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity and tremors. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In some instances, operators of produced water injection wells in the vicinity of minor seismic events have been ordered to reduce produced water injection volumes or suspend operations. Regulatory agencies are continuing to study possible linkage between produced water injection activity and induced seismicity. These developments could result in additional regulation of produced water injection wells, such regulations could impose additional costs and restrictions on TEP's produced water disposal operations.
Federal and State Waters
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, or the CWA, and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including petroleum products, into state waters or waters of the United States. The EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers recently adopted a rule to clarify the meaning of the term "waters of the United States" with respect to federal jurisdiction; that rule is currently stayed nationwide. Many interested parties believe that the rule expands federal jurisdiction under the CWA. Regulations promulgated pursuant to the CWA and analogous state laws require that entities that discharge into federal and/or state waters obtain National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or NPDES, permits and/or state permits authorizing these discharges. The CWA and analogous state laws assess administrative, civil and criminal penalties for discharges of unauthorized pollutants into the water and impose substantial liability for the costs of removing spills from such waters. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require that individual permits or coverage under general permits be obtained by covered facilities for discharges of storm water runoff. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater. We believe that TEP is in substantial compliance with the CWA permitting requirements as well as the conditions imposed thereunder and that continued compliance with such existing permit conditions will not have a material effect on its results of operations. 
The primary federal law related to oil spill liability is the Oil Pollution Act, or OPA, which amends and augments oil spill provisions of the CWA and imposes certain duties and liabilities on certain "responsible parties" related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening United States waters or adjoining shorelines. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws and analogous state laws require TEP to maintain spill prevention control and countermeasure plans. These laws also require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. Regulations promulgated pursuant to OPA further require certain facilities to maintain oil spill prevention and oil spill contingency plans. A liable "responsible party" includes the owner or operator of a facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge, or in the case of offshore facilities, the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging facility is located. OPA assigns joint and several liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. Although defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA, they are limited. In the event of an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge, TEP may be liable for costs and damages.
Endangered Species
The Endangered Species Act, or ESA, restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. While some of TEP's operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, we believe that TEP is in substantial compliance with the ESA. However, the designation of previously unlisted endangered or threatened species could cause TEP to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans or limit future development in the affected areas.

National Environmental Policy Act
The National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, establishes a national environmental policy and goals for the protection, maintenance and enhancement of the environment and provides a process for implementing these goals within federal agencies. A major federal agency action having the potential to significantly impact the environment requires review under NEPA and, as a result, many activities requiring FERC or other federal approval must undergo a NEPA review. A NEPA review can create delays and increased costs that could materially adversely affect TEP's operations.
Employee Safety
TEP is subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that TEP's operations are in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.
Seasonality
Weather generally impacts natural gas demand for power generation, heating purposes and other natural gas usages, which in turn influences the value of transportation and storage. Price volatility also affects gas prices, which in turn influences drilling and production. Peak demand for natural gas typically occurs during the winter months, caused by heating demand. Nevertheless, because a high percentage of TEP's natural gas transportation and storage and crude oil transportation revenues are derived from firm capacity reservation fees under long-term firm fee contracts, TEP's revenues attributable to those segments are not generally seasonal in nature. TEP experiences some seasonality in its processing segment, as volumes at its processing facilities are slightly higher in the summer months. TEP also experiences some seasonality in its maintenance, repair, overhaul, integrity, and other projects, as warm weather months are most conducive to efficient execution of these activities.
Title to Properties and Rights-of-Way
TEP's real property generally falls into two categories: (i) parcels that it owns in fee and (ii) parcels in which its interest derives from leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, surface use agreements, or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities, permitting the use of such land for its operations. Portions of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located are owned by TEP in fee title, and we believe that TEP has satisfactory title to these lands. The remainder of the land on which TEP's pipelines and facilities are located are held by TEP pursuant primarily to leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, surface use agreements or licenses between TEP, as grantee, and a third party, as grantor. We believe that TEP has satisfactory title to all of its material parcels that TEP owns in fee and the material parcels in which TEP's interest derives from leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses, and TEP has no knowledge of any challenge that TEP expects will impact its title to such assets or their underlying fee title in any material respect.
Some of the leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses TEP acquires, including those TEP acquired in the TEP IPO, require the consent of the grantor for the assignment/conveyance of such rights, which in certain instances is a governmental entity. The transferor, such as Tallgrass Development or its affiliates, may continue to hold record title to portions of certain assets until TEP makes the appropriate filings in the jurisdictions in which such assets are located and obtain any consents and approvals that are not obtained prior to transfer. Such consents and approvals would include those required by federal and state agencies or political subdivisions. In some cases, Tallgrass Development may, where required consents or approvals have not been obtained, temporarily hold record title to property as nominee for TEP's benefit and in other cases may, on the basis of expense and difficulty associated with the conveyance of title, cause its affiliates to retain title, as nominee for TEP's benefit, until a future date. TEP anticipates that there will be no material change in the tax treatment of TEP common units resulting from Tallgrass Development holding the title to any part of such assets subject to future conveyance or as its nominee.
Insurance
We generally share insurance coverage with Tallgrass Development, for which we reimburse Tallgrass Development and its affiliates for our share of the cost pursuant to the terms of the TEGP Omnibus Agreement and TEP Omnibus Agreement. This shared insurance program includes general and excess liability insurance, auto liability insurance, workers' compensation insurance, pollution, business interruption and property and director and officer liability insurance. All insurance coverage is in amounts which management believes are reasonable and appropriate.
