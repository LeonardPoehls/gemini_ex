 Item 1. Business
 Overview
 We are a cyber security leader that delivers best-in-class solutions to protect data and applications on-premises, in the cloud, and across hybrid environments. As organizations worldwide undergo digital transformation, particularly as they transition their data and applications from on premises to the cloud, their day-to-day operations are increasingly complex. They have a need for solutions that can support both environments and we believe we are uniquely positioned to help them manage their hybrid environments. Extortion and theft by cybercriminals, using an evolving array of sophisticated attacks, continuously threaten applications and data wherever they reside. Organizations are facing numerous challenges in providing the visibility and control required to protect these business-critical applications and data from attack. Adoption of new technologies and architectures, such as mobile applications, web applications, application to application interfaces and big data, increases the complexity of, opens access to, and increases the vulnerability of business-critical data and applications. The increasing use of virtualization technologies and cloud delivery models, including unsanctioned, employee-adopted applications, known as “shadow IT,” is forcing organizations to operate outside of the traditional security model. Additionally, organizations must comply with complex regulatory standards enacted to ensure they protect their systems and data. We believe that these challenges are driving a greater need for cyber security solutions that protect applications and data, wherever they reside - on-premises, in the cloud, and across hybrid environments.
 Our cyber security solutions directly protect the business critical data and applications that are being attacked, and are designed to fill the gaps left by existing endpoint and network or perimeter security solutions. Our cloud offerings protect against the unique threats created as enterprises increasingly deploy their applications and store their data in the cloud and allow our customers to take advantage of the flexibility and cost-efficiency offered by cloud-based solutions. 
 Our Imperva SecureSphere platform provides database, file and web application security across various physical and virtual systems in data centers, including those in traditional on-premises data centers as well as in private, public and hybrid cloud computing environments. Our Imperva Incapsula product line provides cloud-based website security, denial of service protection and performance solutions that do not require software or hardware changes. Our Imperva CounterBreach product line uses machine learning to analyze how users access data and to spotlight data breach activity. Our Imperva Camouflage product line pseudonymizes and anonymizes sensitive data by masking it so it can be safely used in development, testing, warehouses and analytical stores. 
 Business Highlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2017
 In February 2017, we sold the assets of our Skyfence Networks Ltd. business to Forcepoint LLC for approximately $40 million in cash. 
 In March 2017, we introduced our FlexProtect licensing program to give customers access to our on-premises and hybrid solutions for data and applications under a single license.  Designed to give customers the flexibility to use Imperva products, regardless of where data and applications are initially deployed or migrated, Imperva FlexProtect directly supports dynamic hybrid cloud deployments and provides needed investment protection to manage this transition.
 We also experienced several changes on the executive management team during 2017 and in early 2018 that led to the rollout of new strategic initiatives. In August 2017, Christopher Hylen joined as our new President and Chief Executive Officer and undertook a review of our strategy and operations, with oversight from the Board of Directors. In January 2018, Mike Burns joined as our new Chief Financial Officer. On January 22, 2018, we announced organizational changes designed to allow us to focus on customers and product innovation and to drive operational efficiencies. 
 As part of the reorganization, we unified disjointed teams under sales, marketing, product management and product development to drive more cohesive go-to-market product strategies, and to increase efficiencies. We also created a new customer success function and appointed Sunil Nagdev as Chief Customer Officer to improve our customer renewal process and delivery of our subscription services. We plan to reallocate in excess of $10.0 million to fund incremental investments in the new initiatives and growth priorities.  
 On February 8, 2018, we announced our strategy to transform into the world’s leading hybrid security company, accelerate our go-to-market and simplify how we do business. We declared our key growth priorities to invest in world-class cloud experiences, create actionable insights through data and analytics and deliver innovative new services that extend our offerings.

Intellectual Property
 To protect our intellectual property, both domestically and abroad, we rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws. As of December 31, 2017, we had 38 issued patents and 16 pending patent applications in the United States. The claims for which we have sought patent protection relate primarily to methods, computer programs, devices and systems we have developed for our products. We also license software from third parties for integration into our products, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.  Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of relevant patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. For more information about risks related to our and third party intellectual property rights see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business— Assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business and operating results”; “—We rely on the availability of licenses to third-party software and other intellectual property, the loss of which could increase our costs and delay software shipments”; “—Our products contain “open source” software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business”; and “—Failure to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and operating results.”
Manufacturing and Suppliers
 Our security hardware appliance products are manufactured to our specifications by Caswell, Inc. and to a lesser extent Lanner Electronics Incorporated. Both are Taiwanese original design manufacturers of network appliance hardware products. We have entered into non-exclusive contracts to purchase these hardware appliances from American Portwell Technology, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Portwell, Inc.) and Lanner Electronics USA, Inc., which are value-added distributors of these products. 
 The value-added distributors receive the hardware appliances from the manufacturer, configure and install our proprietary software on the appliances and then undertake quality testing at their fulfillment centers. They then ship our appliances directly to our distributors, resellers or customers or our logistics partner, Base Logistics BV. We hold inventory in their fulfillment centers and in our logistics partner’s warehouses, in anticipation of orders for new appliances and to support our advance replacement program with new and repaired appliances. In addition, our contracts with our value-added distributors govern their use of our intellectual property and allocate the responsibilities for warranty repair, out of warranty repair and replacement costs with respect to damaged and defective products. These contracts remain in effect until terminated by either party. The contracts are terminable by us for any reason upon six months’ notice, by the value-added distributors upon nine months’ notice or by either party for an uncured material breach. 
 We currently work with and provide the value-added distributors with rolling product demand forecasts, but our contracts contain no obligation for us to purchase any minimum amount of products. We submit purchase orders that describe the types and quantities of our products to be manufactured, the delivery dates and other delivery terms. Upon submitting the purchase orders, we are committed to purchase inventory within six months from the date the inventory arrived at the vendor’s warehouse.
We believe that having third parties manufacture, configure and test our products and provide a substantial portion of our logistics enables us to efficiently allocate capital, better adjust manufacturing volumes to meet changes in demand and more quickly deliver products, allowing us to focus resources on our core competencies.
 The hardware components included in our products are sourced from various suppliers by our manufacturers and are principally industry standard parts and components that are available from multiple vendors. We have limited sources of supply for certain key components of our products, such as semiconductors, printed circuit boards and hard disk drives, which exposes us to the risk of component shortages or unavailability. For more information on risks related to product manufacturing and availability of components, see the section entitled “Risk Factors–Risks Related to Our Business–Delays or interruptions in the manufacturing and delivery of SecureSphere appliances by our manufacturers may harm our business.”

The SEC also maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding registrants, such as Imperva, that file electronically with the SEC. The address of the website is www.sec.gov. In addition, you may read and copy any filing that we make with the SEC at the public reference room maintained by the SEC, located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information about the public reference room.
