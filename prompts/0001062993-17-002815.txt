Item 1 - Business 
 Business Overview
We utilize a proprietary compressed air energy storage power generation technology that can store energy for other alternative energy sources (for example, using solar, wind, geothermal, and tidal as raw power to regenerate electricity power without the use of fossil fuels or other chemical methods.) The power produced by compressed air energy storage and power release can enhance the power production capabilities of alternative energy sources. If alternative energy sources cannot be fully utilized, there will be waste sources. We believe that we utilize compressed air energy storage installations in conjunction with the power generation system of alternative energy sources that could ensure the stable power supply of alternative energy generation system and provide customers with an advanced power generation capability with no carbon or toxic emissions. Thus, our compressed air energy storage power generation technology provides a distinct and novel method for alternative energy sources. 
 The power generated from our system can either be used for the operation of our customers or be sold to the State Grid Corporation of China (the National Grid). We also utilize proprietary technology to enhance the power production capabilities of the photovoltaic solar panels (PV panels) that have been used in conjunction with our current projects, including projects that involve only the installation of PV panels without the installation of equipment for compressed air energy technology. 
 Our initial focus is on industrial users. As of July 31, 2016, we had thirteen principal projects. Seven were completed, four had not yet started, one was under construction and one was being canceled. The two largest projects included an installation of PV panels in conjunction with our compressed air energy storage technology and consist of an installation at a factory in Shandong Province with a capacity of nine megawatts and a power plant in Hubei Province with a capacity of six megawatts. The installation in Shandong Province commenced production of electricity from the solar panel installation in June 2014. The installation in Shandong Province has been completed and is awaiting approval from the National Grid to connect to the National Grid. The sale price for the project was $20,290,835 (RMB126,000,000). As of July 31, 2016, we had received a total payment of $17,037,860 (RMB 105,800,000). The installation in Hubei Province was completed in March, 2016. The Company is waiting for the National Grid to finish the construction of a converter to link the project to the National Grid. The sale price for the project is $10,628,553 (RMB66,000,000). As of July 31, 2016, we received a total payment of $5,491,409 (RMB34,100,000).

We produce our systems in China primarily for Chinese customers and are also exploring foreign markets. We benefit from the Chinese governments incentives for the production of green energy. We operate a factory in Hebei province to produce components for the compressed air energy storage power generation systems, but also purchase certain components, such as PV panels and diesel engines from third party suppliers, which we modify to operate with compressed air. We have a distribution network of third-party distributors and sales agencies in 24 provinces in China 
 Recent Developments
In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016, we gained valuable experience through analyzing market data and performing in-depth market research. 
 First, we achieved significant improvement through research and testing on the air compression power generation system. We developed enhanced air compression (liquid power) generation system based on the original models. The primary mechanism is to utilize the compressed air as a power source and the green biodegradable medium of oil as a power transmitter to support the engine running and generating power. The tested output comprehensive conversion efficiency reached 46%-65%. The research improved the conversion efficiency of our air power generation system, laying the foundation for mass industrialization and commercial marketization.

In order to obtain government approval of the commercialization of our air compression energy storage products, we have submitted three enterprise standards, namely, air compression (liquid power) power generation system, air compression (liquid power) power generation unit and air compression radial engine. We are establishing an enterprise standard because these products have no ISO or other qualifying standard for the industry. The certification is therefore based on our design specifications. 
 We hope that future air power compressed products in this field will follow and adhere to our standards which we anticipate will become the industrial standard and national standard. We expect that if we become the industry and national standard, our market competitiveness will be enhanced. The declaration we submitted for these three standards is being reviewed by the Provincial Industrial and Information Department of the Sanhe Technical Service Bureau. 
 Second, to improve sales and marketing, we intensified our efforts to promote the air power products. We also seek to benefit from the national governments Helping-the-Poor Project established in 2016. The Chinese government has announced plans to release over three to five years US$14.7 billion (100 billion RMB) worth of future electricity generating capacity to support poverty alleviation and development through low cost loans and power subsidies with more than 60% of which will be for Photovoltaic (PV) technology. Accordingly, we established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Xianning Xiangtian Air Energy Electric Co., Ltd., in Hubei Xianning for this market, and invested US$1,776,000 (12 million RMB) to install an advanced automatic PV panel production line. This production line has an annual production capacity of 200 megawatts (MW). 
 As of October 10, 2016, we signed a contract for 2 MW PV project in Dezhou with a prior customer with expected revenue for US$1,044,000 (7.1 million RMB). In addition, we will also supply a total of US$901,000 (6.13 million RMB) of products such as PV panels, inverters and brackets. 
 Through 2017, the Company will concentrate its efforts to build and market our patented products, and take advantage of the government sponsored policy of the Helping-the-Poor Project. 
 Our Business History and Background
Xiangtian (USA) Air Power Co., Ltd. was originally incorporated as Goa Sweet Tours Ltd. in the State of Delaware on September 2, 2008. We were originally formed to provide personalized concierge tour packages to tourists who visit the State of Goa, India. On April 17, 2012, Goa Sweet Tours, Ltd. entered into Share Purchase Agreements (the Purchase Agreements), with Luck Sky International Investment Holdings Limited, an entity owned and controlled by Zhou Deng Rong, and certain of our former stockholders who owned, in the aggregate, 7,200,000 shares of our common stock (90% of the then outstanding shares). Luck Sky International Investment Holdings Limited purchased such shares for an aggregate consideration of $235,000. The sale of such shares closed on May 15, 2012. 
 7 

On May 25, 2012, Goa Sweet Tours, Ltd. formed a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware called Xiangtian (USA) Air Power Co., Ltd. ("Merger Sub") for the purpose of changing its name. On the same day, we acquired one hundred percent of the total outstanding shares of Merger Sub's common stock for cash. As such, Merger Sub became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Effective as of May 29, 2012, Merger Sub was merged with and into the Company. As a result of the merger, the Companys corporate name was changed to Xiangtian (USA) Air Power Co., Ltd. Prior to the merger, Merger Sub had no liabilities and nominal assets and, as a result of the merger, the separate existence of the Merger Sub ceased. The Company was the surviving corporation in the merger and, except for the name change provided for in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, there was no change in the directors, officers, capital structure or business of the Company. 
 Lucksky Holding (Group) Co. Ltd (LuckSky Group), formerly named Xiangtian Kelitai Air Powered Machinery Co., Ltd., (Xiangtian Kelitai) was established in 2000 by Zhou Deng Rong after he obtained a series of patents and developed the compressed air energy storage and related technology. Zhou Deng Rong served as our CEO through July 31, 2014, when he was replaced by Zhiqi Zhang. Upon the merger of Luck Sky (Hong Kong) Shares Limited (Luck Sky HK) into the Company on September 3024, 2013, the Company acquired all of the shares of LuckSky HK, received 148,158,864 shares of common stock of the Company and the remaining shareholder of LuckSky HK received 101,831,136 shares of common stock of the Company in exchange for their shares of LuckSky HK. LuckSky HK had no operations but the Company succeeded to the $250,000 in registered capital of LuckSky HK 
 On May 30, 2014, the Company entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement with Zhou Jian, the sole shareholder of Luck Sky (Hong Kong) Aerodynamic Electricity Limited (LuckSky Aerodynamic). Effective May 30, 2014 the Company purchased 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Luck Sky Aerodynamic, and the Company paid Zhou Jian a purchase price in the amount of HKD $10,000.00 (approximately USD$1,290) in cash. Luck Sky Aerodynamic and Luck Sky Shen Zhen, its subsidiary organized in the PRC, had no operating business, no liabilities and nominal assets as of the date of the acquisition. LuckSky Aerodynamic was organized to enter into the variable interest agreements (the VIE Agreements) with Sanhe. As a result of the acquisition, Luck Sky Aerodynamic became our wholly owned subsidiary and Luck Sky Shen Zhen became our indirect subsidiary through Luck Sky Aerodynamic. 
 Sanhe was established in July 2013 and was under common control with LuckSky Group. Sanhe had no operating business and no liabilities. On July 18, 2013, Sanhe borrowed RMB7,722,000, pursuant to a loan agreement with Xiangtian Kelitai, a division of LuckSky Group. 
 During the three months ended July 31, 2014, LuckSky Group provided Sanhe with additional working capital and transferred to Sanhe its assets and liabilities related to the compressed air energy storage power generation technology and PV panel installations, but retained its other assets. On April 1, 2014, LuckSky Group loaned Sanhe RMB3,000,000. In April and May 2014, Sanhe purchased the inventory, the equipment, including machinery, and office equipment from Xiangtian Kelitai at their book or historical values. Sanhe entered into leases with Lucksky Group for a portion of the factory, office space and dormitory located in Sanhe City and a lease with Dong Yi Glass Machine Company Limited, which is owned by Zhou Deng Rong, for a second factory and office space, on May 1, 2014 and April 1, 2014, respectively. Also, 48 employees have transferred from LuckSky Group to Sanhe, including all personnel related to the projects under construction and development and administrative and finance personnel. See Business-Properties and Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.

 10 

The foregoing description of the terms of the Framework Agreement on Business Cooperation, the Exclusive Management Agreement, Consulting and Training and Technical Service Agreement, the Exclusive Option Agreement, the Equity Pledge Agreement, the Know-How Sub-License Agreement and the Power-of- Attorney is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the agreements previously filed with the SEC in August 2014, which are incorporated by reference herein. 
 On July 25, 2014, we agreed to issue 264,850,740 shares and 8,191,260 shares of our common stock to Zhou Jian and Zhou Deng Rong, respectively, the sole shareholders of Sanhe, in consideration for the execution of the VIE Agreements and the Acquisition of Sanhe. 
 See Certain Relationships and Related Transactions for further information on our contractual arrangements with these parties. 
 Because of the common control between us, LuckSky Shen Zhen and Sanhe, for accounting purposes, the acquisition of these entities has been treated as a combination between entities under common control with no adjustment to the historical basis of their assets and liabilities. Since there is a change of reporting entity after the acquisition takes place, the Company accounts for business combinations pursuant to Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 805-50 which generally requires the entity that receives net assets or equity interests to recognize the carrying amounts of the net assets transferred in its accounting for the combination and to combine the financial statements of the entities under common control for all periods presented and to eliminate any intercompany balances and transactions. 
 Our Corporate Structure
All of our business operations are conducted through our Hong Kong and Chinese subsidiaries and controlled affiliate. The chart below presents our corporate structure: 
 
Industry Background
Consumption of electricity in China has grown from 5.32 trillion kWh in 2013 to 5.52 trillion kWh in 2014. Thermal power amounted to 67.3% power generation capacity at the end of 2014, down from 69.1% at the end of previous year. The electricity generated by grid-connected solar was 26.52 GW with an increase of 67% from 2013. 
 11 

*The data is from the NEAs report of total consumption of electricity in 2014 (published in 2015) 
 We are a pioneer in the field of Compressed Air Energy Storage in China. The only other effort in China of which we are aware is a pilot project established by the Chinese Academy of Science (the CAS) of compressed air storage energy generation in Wuhu city in November 2014. 
 We are producing electricity generation systems that combine our compressed air storage technology with PV panels to achieve a continuous supply of power, especially under weather conditions that are unfavorable to the generation of electricity from PV panels alone. We chose to initially utilize PV panels to produce the raw power because China has abundant solar energy resources. Many parts of China have long durations of sunshine; and China has vast vacant spaces that are available for the installation of solar energy systems. 
 The installation of PV systems is developing quickly in China. In 2014, China became the largest manufacturer of the PV in the world and the country utilizing the second most number of PV modules. According to the 13th Five Year Plan (published in 2015), the government hopes to add 65 Gigawatts (GW) of PV during the 2016  2020 period. In 2015, 35 GW of electricity will be produced by PV panels in China, an increase from 3 GW in 2012, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=CH). In its guidance on promoting the healthy development of the Solar Industry (2013), the State Council of China raised the target of capacity of solar power to 35 GW in 2015 from the original 2015 target of 21 GW set by the National Energy Administration of China in 2012. China had only one GW of PV installations in 2010. 
 The Chinese solar market has grown rapidly, driven by a favorable policy environment intended to meet a greater portion of the countrys growing energy needs from cleaner sources, while also driving demand for domestic solar panel manufacturers. In July 2013, the State Council of China published the Opinion on Promoting the Healthy Development of PV Industry (the Opinion) which initiated establishment of the PV systems in the national level. In addition to setting targets for the increase in installed PV systems, grid-connection, power acquisition, subsidy, and land policies were further detailed in the Opinion. The Opinion standardized the tax benefit and feed-in tariff for the PV industry on a national level and it also set the target of promoting distributed PV (DPV) system. The feed in tariffs for large-scale ground mounted power plants are between 0.9 yuan ($0.14) and 1 yuan ($0.16) per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of energy generated, based on the radiation levels at the location of the plant. Distribution projects get a payment of between 0.62 yuan ($0.10) to 0.78 yuan ($ 0.12) per kWh. These subsidies will be valid for the next 20 years and will benefit project developers such as ourselves, since the subsidies protect the rate of return on PV projects. In October 2013, China adopted a tax benefit policy which allows a refund of 50% value-added tax for selling the solar photovoltaic power products. China also provides other incentives, including free grid connectivity for small and medium-scale distributed PV solar power producers. 
 12 

The promotion of the DPV module is encouraging the manufacture and installation of PV in China. The government started to promote the distributed PV (the DPV) model in the proposal of the Opinion in 2012. The DPV systems are smaller PV system installed on the rooftop of building. This system generally can provide the sufficient energy for the building where it is located. On the national level, the national government allows the DPV system to be connected to the national grid. In this case, the DPV owner can either use the electricity or sell the electricity to the national grid with feed-in tariff (around 1 CN per kWh). 
 As of the end of March 2015, the total capacity of all the installed PV systems in China reached 33.12 million KW, of which, 27.79 million KW were generated by photovoltaic power plants and 5.33 million KW were generated by distributed solar systems and arrays. In the first quarter of 2015, the total capacity of all the installed PV systems was increased by 5.04 million KW, of which, 4.38 million KW was generated by power plants and 660,000 KW was generated by distributed PV systems. (http://www.nea.gov.cn/2015-04/20/c_134165328.htm) 
 The solar panel industry in China is highly competitive, with around 20 to 30 companies providing installation service and 50 manufacturers. In 2014, six of the 10 largest PV panel manufacture were located in China However, we believe that we are the only company that offers an electrical generation system that combines compressed air energy storage power generation technology. 
 Our Competitive Advantages
We believe that we possess the following competitive advantages that allow us to maintain our strong market position and will aid our profit growth in the future: 
 Environmental Protection: We believe that if alternative energy sources cannot be fully utilized, including instances when the electricity they produce cannot be economically stored or the source is unstable, then some productive capacity will be wasted. We utilize compressed air energy storage equipment in conjunction with the power generation system of alternative energy sources to produce electricity, which is a novel approach and provides customers with an advanced power generation capability with no carbon or toxic emissions. When power generated by the alternate energy sources, such as solar energy or wind energy, becomes unstable or fluctuates, the compressed air power generation system can start functioning and ensure a stable power supply and better utilize the productive capacity of the alternate energy source. . Our compressed air energy storage power generation technology provides a new and unique method for alternative energy source power generation. 
 Flexibility: Our compressed air technology can be used with any other power sources. We can use solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, tidal energy, water energy and all the available natural energy as a raw power in conjunction with our compressed air energy storage technology. The collected mechanical energy from the raw power source is converted into compressed air and is then converted and released into direct current power. Through our ultra-wide voltage and high-performance power inverter, we produce an output of stable power in compliance with the Chinese national interconnection standards. 
 13 

Enhancement of Use of PV Panels and other Energy Sources: The use of the compressed air energy storage technology helps overcome structural limitations of the use of PV panels and providing power to the National Grid. The use of PV panels is limited by the capacity of the National Grid, which limits the amount of energy that can be purchased from the PV industry and other sources of alternate energy that lack the capacity to efficiently store electricity but produce more power that can be used when generated. The expansion of the capacity of the PV industry could be constrained by the inability of the power grid to purchase the additional energy and the compressed air energy storage technology allows the energy to be stored until the electricity can be sold to the National Grid when PV panels are not producing electricity, such as when there is insufficient sunshine. 
 Patent Protection: Zhou Deng Rong, our founder and former Chief Executive Officer, and Zhou Jian, our Chairman of the Board, and LuckSky Group are the holders of 48 patents and 13 patent applications in China with respect to various aspects of the compressed air energy storage power generation technology, including improvements to the solar power generation system, the installation of solar energy systems, the inverters, and generators. Sanhe obtained a Chinese patent in August 2014 for utility module regarding photovoltaic power generation system. In addition, the patents, patent applications and related know-how and trade secrets are subject to an exclusive license for worldwide use to Luck Sky Shen Zhen, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary. 
 Government Incentives: The development of alternative sources of energy to reduce the amount of pollution in China caused by burning fossil fuels, particularly the use of coal to generate electric power, is a priority of the Chinese government. The Chinese government offers tax and rebate incentives for the construction of PV production facilities and has become stricter regarding the construction of power plants that rely on coal. 
 Technical Advantage Compared to Conventional Battery Technologies: The use of conventional batteries to store excess electricity produced by solar power or other alternative energy sources is less attractive than the compressed air energy storage power generation technology. The most important disadvantages to standard batteries are that industrial batteries lose their capacity to store electricity over time, and also present environmental risks with respect to their production and disposal. Tank storage technology is estimated to have a 30 year lifespan and the steel can be recycled. 
 Technical Advantage Compare to Conventional Solar Panels and Inverter/Converters: Our patented technologies increase the efficiency of PV panels to generate DC current by enhancing their ability to operate at levels of lower sunlight and also increase the efficiency of the inverter/converter that converts the DC current to AC current by operating at a wider range of DC current than conventional inverter/converters. One licensed patent applies to the array of the PV panels. 
 14 

Technical Advantage Compare to Conventional Grid-connected Photovoltaic Power Generation: We adopted smart micro-grid technology which increases the efficiency of the power generation of the PV systems and significantly reduced the project costs of power plants. The micro-grid technology also helps us to improve the flexibility of PV systems, realize real zero emission of our power plant, improve reliability and help to restore power more quickly when the macrogrid is down. 
 Reduced Electrical Costs: Customers who generate electricity using alternate energy systems that is intermittent or subject to periods of low production need to be linked to the National Grid to meet their power requirements. Our compressed air energy storage power generation system allows consumers to limit or eliminate their reliance on the National Grid; by producing power during periods of peak pricing by the National Grid and storing the surplus energy produced by their alternate energy systems when prices charged by the National Grid are less expensive. 
 Scalability: The compressed air energy storage power generation system in conjunction with a PV panel installation is easily expanded thru the addition of additional solar panels, more storage tanks and/or bigger generators and engines. 
 Our Growth Strategy
Chinese demand for electricity is expected to increase by nearly 300 % between 2010 and 2040 according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=CH). We believe demand for electricity and solar energy production will continue to grow domestically and globally, thus affording us opportunity to grow and expand our business operations 
 We intend to pursue the following strategies: 
 
1) | Sell systems to construct large-scale power plants that sell power to the National Grid or service zones that are off the grid and benefit from government subsidy policies. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Sell power system to industrial consumers with large electricity demand, in excess of one megawatt, to establish their own power generation facilities to benefit from government subsidy polices to reduce operating costs by either being off the National Grid, reducing their purchased from the grid during peak periods or being able to store energy when the grid is not purchasing power. 
3) | Sell systems to industrial and mining companies operating in remote locations which lack connections to the National Grid to create self- sufficient systems. 
4) | Complete development of prototypes and commercialize smaller air compression power generation systems designed for standalone homes and smaller factories and commercial structures. 

 15 


5) | Produce, sell and install PV products without air compression technology. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Products
Our principal product is a system that combines our air compression power generation systems with a PV installation that is custom designed for industrial users such as factories and power plants. We also offer PV systems without the air compression generation technology based on certain technological innovations that we believe increase the efficiency of our PV systems compared to those of competitors. 
 The air compression power generation systems can be used with multiple forms of natural energy production, including solar, wind, biomass, geothermal and tidal and the selection of the appropriate natural source depends on their relative availability at the customers location. Although use of any of these natural energy sources is feasible, we have initially focused on linking our air compression technology to PV installations The installation of the solar power systems generally requires the lowest investment and shortest building time, in part because the area for building the facility is flexible as solar installations can be used anywhere outdoors and take advantage of a customers room. Wind power is not stable as the turbines may be inoperable at low or high winds. Nuclear and hydropower facilities are only feasible for producing power for the National Grid and are not feasible for individual factories and homes 
 1. Basic PV Installation. Conventional PV power generation technology is designed based upon the assumption that the minimum sun exposure would be 200W and the range of maximum power point tracking (the MPPT) is from DC480v to DC580v. When sun exposure is reduced and voltage drops below the DC480v, the problem with the conventional system is that it stops working; and the residual power in the photovoltaic panels that are generated under the lower light exposure cannot be utilized. The Companys new intelligent photovoltaic technology improves power generation and shortens investment recovery time. The PV system uses a variable PV array technology and wide voltage intelligent inverter device developed by the Company. Customers can produce an additional 15% - 30% electricity each year as the system can operate in lower light environments than conventional PV technology. 
 We sell the PV installation that includes the solar panels installation and solar energy generation converter equipment with proprietary technology without the air compression for customers who do not need to store energy. The conversion advantage provides a higher capacity that allows the solar array to be used more effectively. 
 2. Compressed Air Energy Storage Technology. The power consumption rate of PV systems interconnected into the National Grid varies greatly and the active energy cannot be fully consumed, which causes significant energy waste. Generally, systems interconnected to the National Grid consume only 70% of the produced power and enterprises not connected to the National Grid consume only 60% - 70% of the produced power, and the residual power is wasted. Utilizing our compressed air energy storage system with photovoltaic power generation system improves the efficiency of power generation and reduces the waste of residual power. 
 16 

Our air compression energy storage generation technology is also designed for customers whose alternative energy source provides intermittent or unstable power. The systems are sold in conjunction with a PV installation. A portion of the electricity produced by the PV panels is used to compress air into the cylinders, which effectively store the energy until it is released. The system includes compression equipment, storage tanks and a modified engine that is linked to a generator. The surplus power generated by the air compression technology may either be used by the customer it its operations or sold to the National Grid. 
 The following chart illustrates an air compression power generation system that is linked with a PV installation, although the compression system can be linked to other alternative energy sources, such as wind farms, biomass, tidal or geothermal.

Electricity Generation Process
            1.        Energy collection  photovoltaic power generation. 
 Photovoltaic power generation is greatly affected by the amount of sunlight the PV system receives. The changes in the intensity of sunlight affect the power generation, which causes direct current to fluctuate. Therefore, actions to offset the fluctuation are essential. When fluctuation or disruption in photovoltaic power occurs, or during the night or when power in the storage system is exhausted, the power supply must be converted to a voltage transformer. However, based upon the current power supply equipment in power plants, energy cannot be instantly converted on a per megawatt basis. Therefore, frequent conversions are needed, which might obstruct system security and power production. Our design of the AC/DC non-contact converter rectifier can resolve this issue at a low cost. If DC power is below DC430v, DC offset is automatically incorporated into the electricity network and the transformer photovoltaic power will be shared with the power supply. The inverter wont lose electricity and the entire system will not fluctuate or have the power shut off. 
 The system offers double power selection by utilizing a backup switch to ensure that the power supply does not stop. Should the generation of the solar power become unstable or intermittent, the system switches to operate using the air compression generation technology or, if available, to rely on the National Grid. 
        2.        Compression Storage System A. Compressor  fills storage tanks with air. 
 B. Plasma Heater  heats air being stored into tanks to a temperature of 300 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit to increase the amount of stored energy. 
 C. Storage Tanks  stores compressed air. Our storage tanks are built with carbon steel to withstand higher pressures. Each one megawatt of generated electricity requires 2 tanks, each with an average capacity of 30 m3 of compressed air. The standard tank is 50 meters long and 1.5 meters in diameter. The energy capacity per tank is dependent on the temperature and pressure of the air and the capacity of the e cylinder. The quality of the storage tanks are based on ISO standards. 
 D. Air Engine  we utilize our patented technology to modify diesel engines purchased from outside vendors to enable the engine to operate on compressed air. A pressure regulator within the air engine turns the generator. Unlike a conventional combustion engine that explodes fossil fuel to create energy, the compressed air engine utilizes the heat and compression of the air to release energy. 
 E. Generator  Our proprietary generator utilizes patented and other proprietary technology was developed in 2012 for our air compression storage generation system. The device affords stability by maintaining a consistent supply despite changes in the air pressure that may cause inefficiency in the engine (for example, a piston misfiring). Our tests indicated that the generator is more efficient that the industry standard in maintaining a stable flow of voltage. 
 The air compression technology is used to produce electricity primarily at night or at other times when the electricity produced by the PV panels is intermittent or unstable. At such times, the compressed air is sent first from the storage tanks to the thermal heater, then to the engine. The engine then spins a flywheel attached to the generator. 
 Projects
As of July 31, 2016, we had thirteen principal projects. Seven were completed, four were not yet started, one was under construction and one was being canceled. The following chart summarizes the completed projects as of July 31, 2016:

 The project in Heilongjiang, which was under construction as of July 31, 2016, was completed in October 2016. We are negotiating to cancel a project in Sichuan province and the remaining four projects in Shandong and Shanxii provinces had not commenced as of July 31, 2016.
 Two of the completed projects are awaiting certification from the National Grid in order to connect to the National Grid. We have no estimate when the certifications will be obtained since the customers of the projects are responsible for obtaining these certifications. Two systems include compressed air energy storage power generation systems in conjunction with a PV panel installation and four projects, two of which have been completed, only involve PV systems. The contracts typically provide for payments in installments, with approximately 35% paid upon the commencement of construction, and the balance in two equal installments approximately 6 and 18 months later. 
 In Shandong Province, we designed and installed a new power supply system with a capacity of nine megawatts (the Haide Group Project) that includes our air compression technology. Pursuant to an agreement executed by Sanhe with Binzhou Xintuo Natural Energy Electrical Engineering Limited (Binzhou Xintuo) on April 18, 2014, Sanhe will transfer the Haide Group Project in turn-key condition to Binzhou Xintuo after the completion of the installation and construction. The project includes the installation of 15 tanks and eight engines. The project began to produce electricity from the PV panels in June 2014 and was completed in June 2015. The project is awaiting approval from the National Grid before complete commercialization. The customer anticipates utilizing the power produced by the compressed air technology when production from the solar panels is insufficient and when electricity from the National Grid is either too expensive during peak hours or not available. The customer may also generate revenue by selling power to the National Grid. The sale price for the project is $20,290,835 (RMB126,000,000). As of July 31, 2016, we have received a total payment of $17,037,860 (RMB 105,800,000). 
 For the Haide Group Project, we executed a purchase contract for the PV panels with Shandong TD Solar Company Limited, who also installs the PV panels and equipment. We also signed a supplemental agreement with Shandong Thaidai Photovoltaic Technology Co., Ltd., a supplier of the Haide Group Project, in January 2015. The Company paid a deposit of $2,579,896 (RMB 16,000,000) to Ni Baofeng, an unaffiliated third party, who is the guarantor of Sanhes obligations under the agreement with Shandong Thaidai. In order to help assure Shandong Thaidais fulfillment of its supply obligations and to facilitate completion of the project, Ni Baofeng agreed to not release the money to Shandong Thaidai without the consent of Sanhe. As of July 31, 2016, the remaining balance of the deposit is $301,336 (RMB 2,000,000).

In Hubei province, construction of a six megawatt project at a new power plant using air compression technology and PV panels (the Hubei Xianning Project was completed in March 2016. The Company is waiting for the National Grid to finish the construction of a converter to link the project to the National Grid. Sanhe executed a contract with Xianning Auspicious Day Air Energy Power Company Limited on April 25, 2014, pursuant to which Sanhe was responsible for designing, installing and constructing the project and such project will be transferred to Xianning Xiangtian Air Energy Electric Limited Liability Company in turn-key condition. The sale price for the project is $10,628,553 (RMB66,000,000). As of July 31, 2016, we received a total payment of $5,491,409 (RMB34,100,000). 
 For the Hubei Xianning Project, Zhejiang Bowei Industrial and Trading Co., Ltd., provides the PV panels for the project and it engaged a third-party contractor to provide the installation service. The facility has room for expansion should the parties agree to increase the power plants capacity and the capacity is expected to be increased to 18 megawatts. We anticipate three phases of construction of 6, 4 and 8 megawatts. We have delivered 20 storage tanks and additional PV panels and generators as of June 30, 2016, which are sufficient for production of 10 megawatts once installed. Equipment for the production of 6 megawatts of electricity has been installed and is operating. An additional 10 storage tanks and other equipment remains to be delivered to increase the projects capacity to 18 megawatts. 
 Three smaller projects in Shandong and one project in each of Zhejiang and Heilongjiang provinces use PV panels with our proprietary technology to enhance production from PV panels. Our project in Dezhou, Shandong province with a capacity of two megawatts was completed in July 2015 and is awaiting certification from the National Grid to be connected to the National Grid. Our project in Weihai with a capacity of one megawatt was completed in February 2015. We generated initial revenue of $1,133,522 as of April 30, 2015 as a result of completion of Weihai project, and as of July 31, 2015, we have received payments with respect to the project in Dezhou, Shandong province of $1.98 million (RMB 12.3 million). The projects in Zhejiang and Heilongjiang provinces, have capacities of 150 KW and 1000 KW respectively, and the Zhejiang project was completed during the fiscal year ended July 31 2016 and the Heilongjiang project was completed in September, 2016. 
 As of October 10, 2016, we signed a contract for 2 MW PV project with the same customer in Dezhou, with expected revenue for US$1,044,000 (RMB 7.1 million) that is expected to be completed in November 2016. In addition, we will also supply a total of US$901,000 (RMB 6.13 million) of products, including PV panels, inverters and brackets

Marketing
We market our products through third-party distributors in 24 provinces and through employees for direct sales. The distributors exclusively sell our products and receive commissions based on the value of the contracts but no salary. We utilize three classes of distributors based on the size of their territory  provincial, city and town. The distributors target both factories and power plants, but also local governments which may encourage local industry to utilize alternate energy sources. Our marketing focus is on: 

1) | Large scale power plants that sell power to the National Grid or service zones that are off the grid and benefit from government subsidy policies. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Industrial concerns with large electricity demand, in excess of one megawatt, to establish their own power generation facilities to benefit from government subsidy policy to reduce operating costs by either being off the National Grid, reducing their purchased from the grid during peak periods or being able to store energy when the grid is not purchasing power. 
3) | Industrial and mining companies operating in remote locations which lack connections to the National Grid to create self- sufficient systems. 
4) | In 2016, we intend to commence marketing a smaller air energy compression generation and PV system to smaller commercial structures and stand- alone homes using the same distribution network. 

 Manufacturing
We produce and assemble our PV installations and air energy compression generation systems at our factory in Sanhe. We produce many components, including the brackets and supports for the PV panels, an ultra-wideband voltage power inverter and converter, parts to modify the engines to operate using air compression, low-speed aerodynamic generators, and isothermal air compressor and thermal heaters. Other parts, such as solar panels, power cords, engines, carbon fiber tanks and generators and compressors are purchased from third parties and used to assemble our systems. 
 Our factory is based in Hebei Province, Sanhe City, Yanjiao Economic Development Zone, with a production workshop of 7500 square meters for our core-technology equipment that can supply solar energy systems. We produce the engine generators and related components, but not the PV panels. The factory has a total capacity of seven megawatts each month, based on one eight hour shift working six days per week. Capacity can readily be expanded by adding additional shifts or building up to three more production lines at our facility. 
 In May 2016, we established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Xianning Xiangtian Air Energy Electric Co., Ltd., in Hubei Province, Xianning to manufacture PV products. We built a production line in Hubei Province, Xianning to produce PV panels. The production line has an annual production capacity of 200 megawatt (MW). 
 21 

Suppliers
We are not dependent on any single supplier for any important product. We purchase our solar panels from five suppliers, engines from one supplier, and carbon fiber storage tanks from three suppliers. We have a good relationship with each supplier. We believe that many suitable alternate producers of these products are available should we need an alternate supplier. We also purchase electrical components to the inverter/converters, generators, compressors and control panels that we manufacture and believe that alternate suppliers of such components are also readily available. 
 Patents and Technology
Zhou Deng Rong and Zhou Jiang are the inventors for all of our technologies. On July 25, 2014, Luck Sky Shen Zhen, our Chinese subsidiary, obtained an exclusive, worldwide, royalty free license from Zhou Deng Rong and Zhou Jian (his son) and a second exclusive, worldwide royalty free license from LuckSky Group to 48 Chinese patents and 13 patent applications and trade secrets, including the technology underlying the patent applications for power stations, commercial buildings and residences in China, but not for other uses, including wind towers, vehicles and trains (the Technology). The Technology represents all licensors patents with respect to PV power generation installations, the air energy storage power generation technology and trade secrets. As of July 31, 2015, Beijing XiangTian Huachuang Aerodynamic Force Technology Research Institute Company (XiangTian Huachuang).granted Luck Sky Shen Zhen an exclusive worldwide license to four foreign patents that it had recently obtained. XiangTian Huachuang obtained three patents in Japan and one patent in Australia in March 2015. XiangTian Huachuang is owned 30% by Zhou Jian and 70% by Zhou Deng Rong. 
 LuckSky Shen Zhen granted an exclusive sub-license to the use and exploitation of the Technology in China to Sanhe in July 2014, which sub-license provides for a licensing fee of five percent of Sanhes revenues. In addition, Sanhe obtained a patent in August 2014 for utility module regarding photovoltaic power generation system. 
 Research and Development
Our Technology was originally developed principally by Zhou Deng Rong. Sanhe obtained the legal right to use and develop the Technology through the Agreement on Know-How Sub-Licensing executed on July 25, 2014 with Luck Sky Shen Zhen, and Luck Sky Shen Zhen was granted a license to use and sublease the Technology through licensing agreements with Zhou Deng Rong, Zhou Jian, and LuckSky Group, owners of the Technology.
 As of July 31, 2016 and 2015, the research and development department had 2 and 9 employees, respectively. The reduction of the employees in the research and development department was due to the change of the Companys strategy. The Company is focusing on the development of its project installation team and sales promotion team and it is relying on LuckSky Group, a licensor, for its research and development.
 Warranty
We provide a five year limited warranty on all models of compressed air energy generators produced by us, and on the parts we manufacture, such as the inverter/converter and plasma heater. Components that we purchase from third party suppliers, such as the PV panels, storage tanks and the unmodified portions of the engines, are governed by the suppliers warranties. 
 22 

Competition
We compete against larger, better capitalized and better known competitors that have become, or are becoming, vertically integrated in the PV industry value chain, from module manufacturing to PV system sales and installation, such as Yingli Green Energy, one of the largest vertically integrated PV module suppliers in the world. China has about 20 to 30 companies providing PV installation service and 50 PV manufacturers. In 2014, six of the 10 largest PV panel manufacturers were located in China The ability of the vertically integrated competitors to produce modules and sometimes also be polysilicon manufacturers gives them a cost advantage with respect to the price of PV modules, which we purchase, and which could erode our competitive advantage resulting from our PV installation and air compression technologies. Furthermore, we face competition from conventional energy and non-solar renewable energy providers. 
 With respect to large integrated PV system projects, we compete primarily in terms of price, design and construction experience, aesthetics and conversion efficiency. We face competition from other providers of renewable energy solutions, including developers of PV, solar thermal and concentrated solar power systems, and developers of other forms of renewable energy projects, including wind, hydropower, geothermal, biomass, and tidal. We also face competition from other EPC companies and joint venture type arrangements between EPC companies and solar companies. While the decline in PV modules prices over the last several years has increased demand in solar electricity worldwide, competition at the systems level can be intense, thereby exerting downward pressure on systems level profit margins industry-wide, to the extent competitors are willing and able to bid aggressively low prices for new projects and power purchase agreements, or PPAs, using low cost assumptions for modules, components, installation, maintenance and other costs. We face intense competition in the PV system markets and our PV and compressed air energy generation systems compete with different solar energy systems as well as other renewable energy sources in the alternative energy market. 
 Also, air power technologies are being developed in Italy, Germany, the United Stated, and France. 
 Environmental Matters
We have installed various types of anti-pollution equipment in our facilities to reduce, treat, and where feasible, recycle the wastes generated in our manufacturing process. We contain and treat waste water generated in our production process. The other major environmental contaminant we generate is gaseous waste. We treat such gas in our special facilities to reduce the contaminant level to below the applicable environmental protection standard before discharging the gas into the atmosphere. Our operations are subject to regulation and periodic monitoring by local environmental protection authorities. The Chinese national and local environmental laws and regulations impose fees for the discharge of waste substances above prescribed levels, impose fines for serious violations and provide that the Chinese national and local governments may at their own discretion close or suspend the operation of any facility that fails to comply with orders requiring it to cease or remedy operations causing environmental damage. 
 23 

In May 2014, as required by PRC law, we obtained the Environmental Assessment Report on Construction Projects for the manufacturing space that we lease from Dong Yi Glass Machine Company Limited, which is used as our second factory and offices. This report was issued by an independent qualified evaluation company with a conclusion that the operations conducted by Sanhe comply with relevant environmental laws in China, which will not cause detrimental environmental impacts. However, since our primary manufacturing and office space leased from LuckSky Group in Sanhe City has a zoning restriction that only permits agricultural use, we are still in the process of obtaining the approval for the manufacturing use. 
 No penalties have been imposed on us or our subsidiaries, and we believe we are currently in compliance with present environmental protection requirements in all material respects, and have obtained or been in the process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for our production facility. We are not aware of any pending or threatened environmental investigation proceeding or action by any governmental agency or third party. 
 Insurance
We do not maintain property and casualty insurance, product liability insurance or insurance covering injury to our employees. 
 PRC Governmental Regulations
This section sets forth a summary of the most significant regulations or requirements that affect our business activities in China. Other regulations and requirements, such as those relating to foreign currency exchange, dividend distribution, regulation of foreign exchange in certain onshore and offshore transactions, and regulations of overseas listings, may affect our shareholders right to receive dividends and other distributions from us. 
 Renewable Energy Law and Other Government Directives
In February 2005, China enacted its Renewable Energy Law, which became effective on January 1, 2006, or the 2006 Renewable Energy Law. The 2006 Renewable Energy Law sets forth the national policy to encourage and support the use of solar and other renewable energy and the use of on-grid generation. On December 26, 2009, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress adopted an amendment to the 2006 Renewable Energy Law, or the Amended Renewable Energy Law, which became effective on April 1, 2010. While the 2006 Renewable Energy Law has laid the legal foundation for developing renewable energy in China, the Amended Renewable Energy Law has introduced practical implementing measures to enhance such development. 
 24 

The Amended Renewable Energy Law details the principles, main content and key issues of the renewable energy development and utilization plans, further elaborates the requirements for grid companies to purchase the full amount of electricity generated from renewable energy by setting out the responsibilities and obligations of the government, the power companies and the grid companies, respectively, and also clarifies that the state will set up a special fund, referred to as the renewable energy development fund, to compensate the difference between the tariff for electricity generated from renewable energy and that generated from conventional energy sources. The proceeds of the renewable energy development fund may also be used to support renewable energy scientific research, finance rural clean energy projects, build independent power systems in remote areas and islands, and build information networks to exploit renewable energy. It is anticipated that China will publish more detailed implementing rules for the Amended Renewable Energy Law and make corresponding changes to those existing implementing rules relating to renewable energy. 
 The current rebates available for our customers include a rebate of 0.42 RMB per kilowatt for 20 years for factories and 1 RMB per kilowatt for 20 years for power plants. 
 Chinas Ministry of Construction issued a directive in June of 2005, which seeks to expand the use of solar energy in residential and commercial buildings and encourages the increased application of solar energy in townships. In addition, Chinas State Council promulgated a directive in June of 2005, which sets forth specific measures to conserve energy resources and encourage exploration, development and use of solar energy in Chinas western areas, which are not fully connected to electricity transmission grids, and other rural areas. In July 2007, the PRC State Electricity Regulatory Commission issued the Supervision Regulations on the Purchase of All Renewable Energy by Power Grid Enterprises which became effective on September 1, 2007. To promote the use of renewable energy for power generation, the regulations require that electricity grid enterprises must in a timely manner set up connections between the grids and renewable power generation systems and purchase all the electricity generated by renewable power generation systems. The regulations also provide that power dispatch institutions shall give priority to renewable power generation companies in respect of power dispatch services provision. 
 On August 31, 2007, the NDRC implemented the National Medium- and Long-Term Programs for Renewable Energy, or MLPRE, which highlights the governments long-term commitment to the development of renewable energy. 
 On April 1, 2008, the PRC Energy Conservation Law came into effect. Among other objectives, this law encourages the utilization and installation of solar power facilities in buildings for energy-efficiency purposes. 
 On March 23, 2009, the MOF, issued the Provisional Measures for Administration of Government Subsidy Funds for Application of Solar Photovoltaic Technology in Building Construction, which outline a subsidy program dedicated to rooftop PV systems with a minimum capacity of 50 kilowatt-peak. 
 25 

In July 2010, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development issued the City Illumination Administration Provisions or the Illumination Provision. The Illumination Provisions encourage the installation and use of renewable energy system such as PV systems in the process of construction and re- construction of city illumination projects. 
 On July 24, 2011, the NDRC issued the Notice on Improving the On-grid Tariff Policy for Photovoltaic Generation. Under this Notice, it is required that a uniform national benchmark on-grid tariff for solar energy photovoltaic generation be formulated. Furthermore, for PV projects that had been approved before July 1, 2011 and would be completed by December 31, 2011, the feed-in tariff would be RMB1.15/kWh, including value-added tax, or VAT. Except for PV projects that are constructed in Tibet, for PV projects that are approved after July 1, 2011 and PV projects that had been approved before July 1, 2011 but would not be completed by December 31, 2011, the feed-in tariff including VAT would be RMB1/kWh. 
 On March 14, 2012, the MOF, the NDRC and the National Energy Administration, or the NEA, jointly issued interim measures for the management of additional subsidies for renewable-energy power prices, according to which relevant renewable-energy power generation enterprises are entitled to apply for subsidies for their renewable power generation projects that satisfy relevant requirements set forth in the measures. 
 On January 1, 2013, the State Council adopted a Circular on the Twelfth Five-Year Plan for the Energy Development, which sets out key development objectives for the industry during the 12th Five-Year Plan. In accordance with this plan, to optimize the structure of energy consumption, the proportion of non- fossil energy consumption shall be increased to 11.4 percent of total energy consumption by 2015. 
 In March 2013, NDRC issued the Notice on Improving the Pricing Scheme for Photovoltaic Power Generation. According to this notice, the NDRC proposed to reduce the feed-in tariff for utility scale PV projects from RMB 1/kWh to RMB 0.75/kWh, RMB 0.85/kWh and RMB 0.95/kWh, depending on the projects location of construction. The feed-in tariff for PV projects constructed in specific regions would remain at RMB 1/kWh. In addition, the NDRC proposed a subsidy of RMB 0.35/kWh for distributed PV generation projects and the purchase price of electricity generated to be in line with the coal-electricity tariffs. 
 In March 2013, NDRC, the NEA and the MOF, jointly issued measures to standardize settlement of feed-in tariffs, which are believed to help address the delay in payment of solar subsidies and settlement of accounts payable experienced by solar project developers. In addition, pursuant to a July 2013 MOF notice, starting from August 2013, subsidies for distributed PV power generation stations (excluding distributed PV power generation projects) are required to be paid directly from the MOF to the State Grid Corporation of China and the China Southern Power Grid Co., Ltd., rather than through the MOFs provincial counterparts. As a result of such measures, the collection period for feed-in-tariffs is expected to be significantly shortened. 
 26 

The MOF has proposed to almost double the renewable energy surcharge for end-users of electricity from RMB0.008 per kWh to RMB0.015 per kWh, effective since September 25, 2013. 
 On August 26, 2013, the Department of Price of the NDRC released subsidy details for PV projects. Transmission-grid-connected projects will receive a feed-in-tariff of RMB0.90 to RMB1.00 per kWh, and distribution-grid-connected projects will receive a premium of RMB0.42 per kWh in addition to the desulphurized coal benchmark price. Distribution-grid-connected projects are expected to represent the majority of Chinas new PV installation in the next few years. Unlike the rest of the world, capital expenditures for distribution-grid-connected projects are higher than transmission-grid-connected projects, since labor costs for scaffolding and work on rooftops are low in China and rooftop space is currently free. Meanwhile, the NDRC announced that the feed-in tariff will be valid, in principle, for 20 years. 
 On September 23, 2013, the MOF and the State Administration of Taxation jointly issued a notice that ordered a 50% refund of value-added tax on sales by PV manufacturers of their PV products. This VAT refund will be effective from October 1, 2013 through December 31, 2015. 
 On November 26, 2013, the MOF announced that the electricity generated by the distributed PV system for its own use is exempted from paying four governmental charges. On the same date, the NEA promulgated the Interim Measures for the Administration of PV Power Generation., which clarify that the state department in charge of energy and its local counterparts are responsible for the supervision of PV projects. 
 On February 12, 2014, the NEA circulated the target of national solar installations for 2014 to be 14GW, 6GW of which would be targeted for utility scale, 8GW for distributed generation. 
 On the same day, the NEA released a list of 81 New Energy Demonstration Cities and eight industrial demonstration parks in 28 and 8 provinces respectively. These cities and zones are required to achieve their respective mandatory targets in terms of solar PV installations and the percentage of installed renewable energy power generation capacities by the end of 2015, or the end of the 12th Five-Year-Plan. 
 In February 2014, the Certification and Accreditation Administration and the NEA jointly issued the Implementation Opinions on Strengthening the Testing and Certification of PV Products. The implementation opinions provide that only certified PV products may be connected to the public grid or receive government subsidies. The institutions that certify PV products must be approved by the Certification and Accreditation Administration. According to the implementation opinions, PV products that are subject to certification include PV battery parts, inverters, control devices, confluence devices, energy storage devices and independent PV systems. 
 27 

In 2016, the government enacted the Helping the Poor Project. The National Poverty Alleviation Office has set an objective for the provinces and cities to alleviate poverty in the next three years through government investment to construct household power stations for poor families and to subsidize electricity charges for poor families to alleviate poverty. 
 Environmental Regulations
We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials. The major environmental regulations applicable to us include the Environmental Protection Law of the PRC, the Law of the PRC on the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution and its implementation rules, the Law of the PRC on the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution and its implementation rules, the Law of PRC on the Prevention and Control of Solid Waste Pollution and the Law of the PRC on the Prevention and Control of Noise Pollution and the PRC Law on Appraising Environment Impacts. 
 In addition, under the Environmental Protection Law of the PRC, the Ministry of Environmental Protection sets national pollutant emission standards. However, provincial governments may set stricter local standards, which are required to be registered at the State Administration for Environmental Protection. Enterprises are required to comply with the stricter of the two standards. 
 The relevant laws and regulations generally impose discharge fees based on the level of emission of pollutants. These laws and regulations also impose fines for violations of laws, regulations or decrees and provide for possible closure by the central or local government of any enterprise which fails to comply with orders requiring it to rectify the activities causing environmental damage. 
 We have received the environmental certification from the government related to our manufacturing process. 
 Product Quality Certification
Our air energy storage power generation products require certification by the National Quality Supervision Department. As our air compression products are nonstandard, there is no ISO or other qualifying standard for the industry. The certification is therefore based on our design specifications. We have provided the government with our design specifications and begun discussions with the standard. We believe that there is no material risk that the government will not accept our product as the government is encouraging new technology in power generation. 
 Employees
We set out below the total number of our employees and the various functions which they serve as at July 31, 2016.
