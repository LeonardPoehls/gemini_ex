Item 1. | Business

We use the terms “EnerNOC,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to refer to the business of EnerNOC, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
Company Overview
We are a leading provider of demand response solutions and energy intelligence software, or EIS, to enterprises, utilities, and electric power grid operators.
Demand Response Solutions
Our demand response solutions provide our utility customers and electric power grid operators with a managed service demand response resource where we match obligation, in the form of megawatts, or MW, that we agree to deliver to our utility customers and electric power grid operators, with supply, in the form of MW, that we are able to curtail from the electric power grid through our arrangements with commercial, institutional and industrial end-users of energy, or C&I end-users. When we are called upon by our utility customers and electric power grid operators to deliver our contracted capacity, we use our global Network Operations Center, or NOC, to remotely manage and reduce electricity consumption across our network of C&I end‑user sites, making demand response capacity available to our utility customers and electric power grid operators on demand while helping C&I end-users achieve energy savings, improve financial results and realize environmental benefits. Our demand response solutions centralize demand response event performance and help manage outcomes between the control rooms dispatching the resource and the C&I end-users providing the resource. By installing and enabling notification, monitoring and control technology at the C&I end-user site, we provide a single view of performance to the utility customer, electric power grid operator, and the C&I end-user. Performance expectations, as well as curtailment plans, are all managed through a single platform.
We receive payments from our utility customers and electric power grid operators for providing our demand response solutions, and we share these payments with C&I end-users in exchange for those C&I end-users reducing their power consumption when called upon by us to do so. Our demand response solutions are also capable of providing our utility customers with the underlying technology to manage their own utility-sponsored demand response programs and secure reliable demand-side resources. This product consists of long‑term contracts with our utility customers for a technology-enabled managed service that provides our utility customers with real-time load monitoring, dispatching applications, customizable reports, and measurement and verification tools.
In 2016, 2015, and 2014, 83.3%, 79.5%, and 91.7% of our revenue, respectively, was derived from sales of our demand response solutions.
Energy Intelligence Software
Our EIS includes our subscription software, energy procurement solutions, and professional services. We initiated a restructuring plan in 2016 that was designed to materially reduce our operating expenses primarily related to our subscription-based software business and reduce our software organization in order to more appropriately match the current market opportunity. As a result, we expect revenue from our subscription software to be relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. 
Subscription Software
Our EIS provides enterprises with a Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, energy management application that enables them to address their most important energy challenges, including:

• | energy cost visualization, budgets, forecasts, and accruals, which provide our enterprise customers with the ability to develop accurate energy budgets and track cost accruals;


• | utility bill validation and payment, which provides our enterprise customers with a central platform to collect historical utility bills, track trends in utility usage and costs, discover and report billing errors, and streamline accounts payable processes;


• | facility optimization, which allows our enterprise customers to benchmark their facilities against one another, analyze meter data to identify cost savings opportunities and prioritize actions across a portfolio of facilities;


• | energy project tracking, which allows our enterprise customers to track the progress and impact of savings measures that have been implemented;


• | reporting for energy and sustainability disclosure and compliance, which tracks trends in energy and carbon impact, visualizes real-time energy data to understand consumption patterns, automates reporting for purposes of compliance and benchmarking standards such as GRESB and ENERGY STAR, and disaggregates and tracks actual consumption and demand costs; and

1


• | peak energy demand and the related cost impacts, which alerts our enterprise customers when new demand thresholds are being reached, quantifies the cost impact of demand peaks, forecasts new facility and system peaks and alerts on real-time and day-ahead index prices.

Our EIS helps enterprises quickly analyze data, achieve real-time visibility and intelligence about their organization’s energy usage, reduce operational costs, comply and report on sustainability requirements, and drive better business decisions. We built systems to collect and process several forms of data, including real-time energy interval data, tens of thousands of utility tariffs, real time market pricing data, utility bills, weather, customer energy contracts, customer demographic data, and customer production data. We use big data and machine-learning approaches to analyze this data for cost-saving opportunities and to predict future outcomes that can help our enterprise customers make better business decisions.
Energy Procurement Solutions
Our EIS also provides our enterprise and utility customers located in restructured or deregulated markets with the ability to more effectively manage energy supplier selection and the energy procurement process by providing highly-structured auction events designed to yield transparent and competitive energy pricing. Our EIS brings together real-time and future market data, current customer contracts, a customer's risk profile, and a broad footprint of suppliers to a single marketplace. Our procurement platform allows our enterprise and utility customers to:

• | obtain the best price for energy when going to market by having over 300 unique energy suppliers compete for their business in an auction process;


• | identify opportunities to go to market based on their current contracts, their risk profile, and current market conditions;


• | manage energy contracts in a single location providing a more effective way to monitor expirations and current market exposure; and


• | better understand risk in their energy portfolio.

Our energy procurement solutions also include supply procurement advisory services that assist our enterprise customers in developing and implementing risk management and purchasing strategies that provide maximum price transparency and structural savings. 
Professional Services
In addition, we offer premium professional services that support the implementation of our EIS and help our enterprise customers set their energy management strategy, as well as provide energy audits and retro-commissioning. Professional services are offered to our customers as a means to further implement and extend our technology across their organizations.
Strategy
We are a technology company that aspires to change the way the world uses energy through the adoption of our demand response solutions and EIS. We intend to build on our leading position in the markets we serve by leveraging our bright and passionate workforce, scalable and proprietary technology, and substantial operating experience. Key elements of our strategy include:
Attracting and Retaining the Best People
In order to develop best-in-class technology and to be the leading provider of demand response solutions and EIS in the markets we serve, we must attract and retain the best people across our organization. Our workforce is the keystone of our business and our success is dependent upon the talent, passion and work ethic of our employees. We pride ourselves on our strong culture and strive to create a workplace that attracts topflight people who share our values and vision, and are eager to join us in our relentless pursuit to change the way the world uses energy.
Investing in Technological Innovation
Our research and development investments have produced the technology that has kept us at the forefront of energy management since we were founded in 2001. Our technology investments primarily fall into two categories: investing for scale and investing for evolving customer needs. To support our growing customer base and the corresponding increase in data, we continue to make significant investments in scalable cloud deployments that can be leveraged on demand for complex analytics and machine learning. The pace of change in the energy industry has accelerated in recent years resulting in a growing number of new and more complex challenges for our customers. We seek to better understand those challenges and how to best address them through near and long-term product enhancements by working with our enterprise customer and utility customer advisory boards, which we refer to as our Customer Advisory Boards. Our Customer Advisory Boards, consisting of executives from each customer segment, provide us with unique insights that inform many of our research and development investments. We will continue to work closely with our Customer Advisory Boards and our customers, and as their needs evolve, we intend to invest in the research and development necessary to provide them with the technology they demand to manage their most important energy-related challenges.

Developing Markets for Our Demand Response and EIS
We were a pioneer in developing the demand response market in the United States and internationally, and we aim to leverage that success by developing new markets for our demand response solutions and full suite of EIS offerings. We have two primary approaches to developing markets for our demand response solutions and EIS. First, we are helping customers understand the materiality of energy and sustainability to the future of their businesses. As C&I end-users and enterprises continue to better understand the material impacts of energy and sustainability, we are confident they will continue to leverage our demand response solutions to tackle energy management. Second, we believe that building a robust and healthy EIS ecosystem through partnerships and thought leadership is an integral component of early-stage market development.
Driving Operational and Financial Efficiencies in Our Business
We manage a complex business that has experienced significant growth in the scale and scope of its operations in recent years. We work to maximize the efficiency of those operations by focusing on delivering the highest-value products to the highest-potential markets in the most cost-effective manner. Beginning in our fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, or fiscal 2016, we took a significant step in our effort to realize efficiencies in our business by managing our operations in two distinct segments - Demand Response and Software. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe this realignment has created and will continue to create efficiencies in our overall business as a result of enhanced management focus within each segment on performance and key performance drivers. In addition, in fiscal 2016, we initiated a restructuring plan designed to materially reduce our operating expenses primarily related to our subscription-based software. We believe these reductions will create efficiencies that will improve the performance of the Software operating segment. Additional opportunities to realize efficiencies in our business have arisen and may continue to arise from portfolio assessments as we continue to evaluate the long-term strategic fit of each of our assets. We understand the necessity of operating efficiently as we make investments to drive the growth of our demand response solutions and EIS, and we plan to manage the business accordingly.
Technology and Operations
We are focused on delivering industry-leading demand response solutions and EIS. Our technology can be broken down into two primary components: our NOC and our EIS platform.
Network Operations Center
Our NOC monitors all of our network data and health, including customer and C&I end-user connectivity, and electric power grid and market conditions, and serves as our 24/7 customer support center. For our demand response programs, our technology enables our NOC to automatically respond to signals sent to us by utilities and electric power grid operators to deliver demand reductions within targeted geographic regions. Demand reduction is monitored remotely with near real-time data feeds, the results of which are displayed in our NOC through various data presentment screens. Each C&I end-user site is monitored for the duration of the demand response event and operations are restored to normal when the event ends. We currently participate in demand response programs across the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and the United Kingdom.
Energy Intelligence Software Platform
Our cloud based EIS platform is deployed within Amazon Web Services, or AWS, and is built using a microservices-based architecture, which allows for global deployment and provides best in class scalability and performance. Our EIS platform leverages many cutting edge technologies including HBase, Spark, Hadoop, Kafka, Redis, Splunk and AngularJS. The AWS cloud based services enable optimal global deployment for our EIS platform, while providing elastic scalability in support of on-demand compute intensive processing, such as large scale analytics. Our microservices architecture uses a collection of open source components and services that enable the flexible creation of products with a short time to market. Our cloud based EIS platform hosts our solutions portfolio and enables us to quickly build and deploy new EIS solutions. The platform enables us to efficiently scale our EIS in existing and emerging geographic regions, and rapidly grow the number of customers that leverage our platform.
Our EIS platform measures, manages, benchmarks and helps optimize each enterprise customer’s energy consumption and facility operations. We use data science and analytics to forecast demand, continuously monitor and optimize building management equipment, model rates and tariffs, benchmark similar facilities, facilitate the analysis of complex consumption patterns, as well as measure real-time performance of demand response. 
We use this data to provide our utility customers with an integrated customer engagement and demand side management solution. 
In addition, our EIS has the ability to track our enterprise customers' greenhouse gas emissions by mapping their energy consumption with the fuel mix used for generation in their location, such as the proportion of coal, nuclear, natural gas, fuel oil and other sources used.

Sales and Marketing
As of December 31, 2016, our sales and marketing team consisted of 193 employees, which included professionals on our direct sales, channel sales, inside sales, sales operations, solutions engineering, marketing, product marketing, communications, and regulatory and government affairs teams. 
Our salesforce is segmented between teams targeting named accounts and teams targeting mid-market accounts. Named accounts represent the largest opportunity for our EIS solutions. Our sales teams targeting mid-market accounts are organized by product type and are tasked primarily with selling our procurement solutions and securing demand response commitments. 
Our marketing group is responsible for influencing all market stakeholders, including customers, C&I end-users, policymakers, industry analysts and the general media, attracting prospects to our business, enabling the sales engagement process with messaging, training and sales tools, and sustaining and expanding relationships with existing customers through renewal and retention programs and by identifying cross-selling opportunities. This group researches our current and future markets and leads our strategies for growth, competitiveness, profitability and increased market share.
Research and Development
As of December 31, 2016, our research and development team consisted of 101 employees. Our research and development team is responsible for developing and enhancing our existing demand response solutions and EIS, as well as the engineering and design of new functionality.
Our research and development expenses were approximately $26.3 million, $29.3 million, and $20.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we capitalized internal software development costs of $9.8 million, $8.4 million, and $6.0 million, respectively, and these amounts are included as software in property and equipment.
Customers
Electric Power Grid Operators
The electric power grid operators to which we provide our demand response solutions include PJM Interconnection, or PJM, the Australian Energy Market Operator, or AEMO, which was formerly known as the Australian Independent Market Operator Wholesale Electricity Market, Korea Power Exchange, or KPX, Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Alberta Electric System Operator, and Ontario Power Authority, among others. We may choose to participate in additional or different markets in the future based upon various factors, including our ability to secure acceptable pricing arrangements in such markets.
In order to participate in deregulated wholesale electricity markets in the United States and internationally, we are usually required to first become a market member. This typically entails signing membership agreements, which bind us and other participants to agree to adhere to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, or the equivalent relevant regulatory authority in international markets approved by governing documents. After establishing membership in these deregulated markets, we secure access to the market by participating in forward “auctions” or “tenders,” in which we commit to delivering demand response resources several months or even years in advance of a defined delivery period. This auction activity often requires us to post financial assurance with the relevant market operator, and by committing to delivering demand response resources in future periods, we assume the risk of delivery of the committed resource levels and can be subject to financial penalties for both under-delivery and non-delivery.
Utilities
Our named account utility sales team focuses on the largest investor-owned, public power, and retailer utilities. Our utility customers include Pacific Gas and Electric, Consumers Energy, Southern California Edison, Tennessee Valley Authority and Smartest Energy. Our contracts with utility customers typically take 12 to 18 months to complete and have terms that generally range between three and ten years.
4

Enterprises
Our enterprise sales team primarily focuses its efforts on the following six vertical markets: manufacturing/industrial, commercial real estate, healthcare, government, education, and food sales and storage. The following table is a representative list of our enterprise customers as of December 31, 2016 in each of the six key vertical markets that we target:

Manufacturing/Industrial | Commercial Real Estate | Healthcare/Pharmaceutical 
General Motors | Beacon Properties | Athena Health Care Associates 
Kimberly-Clark, Inc. | Beal Companies | George Washington University Hospital
Leggett & Platt | Equity Office Properties | Lonza Group AG 
Saint Gobain | Morgan Stanley | Temecula Valley Hospital 
US Silica | Washington Realty Investment Trust | 
Government | Education | Food Sales and Storage 
Baltimore Regional Cooperative Purchasing Committee | California State University | Great Lakes Cold Storage 
City of Albany, NY | Colorado State University | Shop Rite 
City of Corpus Christi, TX | Knox County Schools | SuperVALU 
County of Los Angeles, CA | North Penn School District | Weis Markets 
U.S. Postal Service | Wicomico County Public Schools | 
The Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts | | 

Our contracts with enterprise customers typically take approximately six to twelve months to complete and have terms that generally range between one and five years.
Competition
We face competition from other providers of demand response solutions and EIS, advanced metering infrastructure service providers, and utilities and competitive electricity suppliers who offer their own products and services. We also compete with traditional supply-side resources, such as peaking power plants.
The industry in which we participate is fragmented. When competing to secure demand response commitments from C&I end-users, we principally compete on the breadth of programs and the sophistication of the proposal offered, as well as the amount of payments shared with those C&I end-users for their commitments.
When competing for utility customers, we believe that the primary factors on which we compete are:

• | the level of understanding and ability to segment the commercial and industrial customer base that the provider is able to deliver to the utility;


• | the pricing of the demand response solutions being offered; and


• | the financial stability, historical performance levels and overall experience of the provider.

When competing for enterprise customers, we believe that the primary factors on which we compete are:

• | the ability of the provider to service multiple sites across different geographic regions and to provide valuable software and technology-enabled solutions;


• | the ability of the provider to apply customer-specific tariff and other pricing components to energy data; and


• | the level of sophistication employed by the provider to identify and optimize energy management capabilities and opportunities.

Our primary competitors include Schneider Electric, Ecova, Siemens, CPower, and NRG Energy. We believe that our operational experience, deep understanding of energy use by C&I end-users, ability to process utility bill data in over 100 countries, proprietary solutions and data analytics, and leadership in the demand response and EIS sectors give us an advantage when competing for customers. In addition, we believe that we are unique in our ability to leverage real-time data to unlock the greatest amount of value and efficiency for our customers, which we believe positions us favorably to win in competitive situations.
Utilities and competitive electricity suppliers may offer energy software solutions at prices below cost or even for free in order to improve their customer relations or competitive positions, which could decrease our base of potential enterprise customers. In addition, utilities and competitive electricity suppliers could, and sometimes do, offer their own demand response solutions, which could decrease our base of potential demand response programs and C&I end-users. However, demand response programs, as administered by utilities alone, are bound to standard tariffs to which all C&I end-users in the utility’s service territory must abide. Utilities must treat all rate class C&I end-users equally in order to serve them under public utility commission-approved tariffs. In contrast, we have the flexibility to offer customized demand response solutions. We believe 
5

that we also have technology and operational experience at the facility-level that both utilities and competitive electricity suppliers lack.
We also compete with traditional supply-side resources such as natural gas-fired peaking plants. In some cases, utilities have an incentive to invest in these fixed assets rather than develop demand response as they are able to include the cost of fixed assets in their rate base. In addition, some utilities have a financial disincentive to invest in energy efficiency and demand response because reducing demand can have the effect of reducing their sales of electricity. However, we believe that our demand response solutions will continue to gain regulatory support as they are faster to market, require no electric power generation, transmission or distribution infrastructure, and are more cost-effective and more environmentally sound than traditional alternatives.
Regulatory
We provide our demand response solutions and EIS in competitive wholesale and retail electricity markets and in traditionally regulated electricity markets. Regulations and public policies within both types of markets impact whether, and how quickly, customers may adopt our solutions, the prices we can charge and profit margins we can earn, the MW we can enroll in certain demand response programs, the procurement solutions we can offer to wholesale and retail customers, the timing with respect to when we begin earning revenue, and the various ways in which we are permitted or may choose to do business and accordingly, our assessments of which potential markets to most aggressively pursue. 
With respect to our demand response solutions, the prices we can charge and revenues and profit margins we earn also can be affected by market regulations, such as program rules that can impact eligibility or suitability of certain demand response resources for particular programs, and our administrative and compliance costs to manage a portfolio of demand response resources. For example, rules that mandate increased requirements, such as rules that might cause more frequent or longer dispatches, varying lead times, and more granularity as to the specific area where demand response may be dispatched may increase our costs. Similarly, market rules and regulations defining methodology for measurement of what constitutes demand response performance can affect the creditable amount of demand response capacity that we are able to enroll from C&I end-users and the amounts that we need to pay them for their participation.
In regional electricity markets in which we participate in auctions, regulations can impact the volume of demand response and capacity resources that are needed to be procured by utility or wholesale market operators, which can affect market clearing prices for our demand response resources. In addition, changes in auction rules impact our participation in future auctions and the ability to reconfigure positions taken in prior auctions. For example, rules which impact quantities of capacity resources we are permitted to bid or purchase in an auction or transfer can impact bidding strategies and how we optimize our portfolio of demand response resources. Market rules and regulations may change subsequent to our assuming a long-term obligation, such as winning a bid to provide demand response capacity in a forward capacity market, but prior to the year in which that capacity is required to be delivered, which could significantly and negatively impact the results of our operations and financial condition. On an ongoing basis, we assess known, anticipated and potential changes to market rules and projected market prices for the solutions that we offer. As a result of such assessments, we may alter our participation in both potential new and existing markets in which we currently offer our demand response solutions, including an assessment not to participate in open market bids to provide demand response capacity.
The policies regarding the measurement and verification of demand response resources, reliability standards and air quality or emissions regulations often vary by jurisdiction and may affect how we do business. For example, some environmental agencies may limit the amount of emissions allowed from back-up generators utilized by C&I end-users, even when back-up generators are strictly used to maintain system reliability. In such a scenario, we would have to find alternative sources of capacity to meet our capacity obligations to our utility customers and electric power grid operators.
The regulatory structures in regional electricity markets are varied and some regulatory requirements make it more difficult for us to provide some or all of our demand response solutions in those regions. The regional electricity markets are generally not subject to direct price/rate regulation, but they remain heavily regulated in other ways that can impact our costs, the level of compensation available, and/or the ability for demand response to participate and the terms of such participation. For instance, some markets have regulatory structures that do not yet include demand response as a qualifying resource for purposes of short-term reserve requirements known as ancillary services. As part of our business strategy, we intend to expand into additional regional electricity markets. However, unfavorable regulatory structures could limit the number of regional electricity markets available to us for expansion.
Intellectual Property
We utilize a combination of intellectual property safeguards, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as employee and third-party confidentiality and proprietary information agreements, to protect our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2016, we held 23 patents in the United States, Canada and Australia, and had 57 patent applications pending. Our patent applications and any future patent applications might not result in a patent being issued within the scope of the claims we seek or at all, and any patents we receive may be challenged, invalidated or declared unenforceable. We continually assess 
6

appropriate circumstances for seeking patent protection for those aspects of our technology, designs and methodologies, and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages.
As of December 31, 2016, we held numerous trademarks in the United States. Several of these trademarks are also registered in Australia, Canada, China, European Community, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa.
With respect to, among other things, proprietary know-how that is not patentable and processes for which patent protection may not offer the best legal and business protection, we rely on trade secret protection and employ confidentiality and proprietary information agreements to safeguard our interests. Many elements of our demand response and EIS solutions involve proprietary know-how, technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications, including technical processes, equipment designs, algorithms and procedures. We have taken security measures to try to protect these elements. All of our employees have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us. These agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions, designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us. We also generally seek confidentiality and proprietary information protection from our customers and business partners before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business strategies. We have not been subject to any material intellectual property claims.
Seasonality
Our revenues can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based primarily upon the seasonality of our demand response business in certain markets in which we operate, where payments under certain of our long-term contracts and pursuant to certain open market bidding programs in which we participate are higher or concentrated in particular seasons and months. Peak demand for electricity and other capacity constraints tend to be seasonal. Peak demand tends to be most extreme in warmer months, which may lead some demand response capacity markets to yield higher prices for capacity or contract for the availability of a greater amount of capacity during these warmer months. For example, in the PJM forward capacity market, which is a market from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenues, we recognize demand response capacity-based revenue from PJM’s limited demand response product in September, at the end of the four month delivery period of June through September. 
The PJM extended demand response product includes the period of June-October, plus May of the following year. Historically, the revenue earned from this product has been recognized at the end of the delivery year in May. Under the new revenue recognition rules that we adopted on January 1, 2017, revenue will more closely align with the service delivery period, which is concentrated in the warmer months of the year. For further discussion of revenue recognition and our adoption of the new revenue recognition rules, please refer to Note 1 contained in Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,077 full-time employees, including 341 charged to cost of revenues, 193 in sales and marketing, 101 in research and development and 442 in general and administrative, including operations. Of these full-time employees, 532 were located in the United States with 355 located in New England, 29 located in California, and the remainder located in other areas across the United States. In addition, we had 272 full-time employees located in Brazil, 115 located in India, 5 located in Canada, 32 located in Germany, 25 located in Australia, 25 located in the United Kingdom and 71 located in our other international locations. Our future success depends in part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel, for whom competition is intense. Except for certain employees of our Brazilian subsidiary that operate under a collective bargaining agreement, our employees are not represented by any labor unions or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Segments
Effective January 1, 2016, we began operating two distinct business units: Demand Response and Software, each with dedicated sales, marketing, and operations functions. See Note 2 in Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a detailed report for each segment.
