Item 1. Business 
Business of Company 

We were incorporated on January 2, 2013 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Our principal executive offices are located at 11767 Katy Freeway, Suite 830, Houston, Texas 77079. Our telephone number is 281-668-8266. Our fiscal year end was February 28/29 but on February 11, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a change in the fiscal year end from a fiscal year ending on February 28 or 29 (as the case may be) to March 31, effective beginning with fiscal year 2016.
 
The Company begun filing its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q based on the new fiscal year-end beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. Therefore, it reported the first quarter of fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 as the three-month period ended June 30, 2016.
 
In addition, its Consolidated Statements of Operations, and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows also included a one-month period ended March 31, 2016.
 
The change to the Company’s fiscal year will not impact the Company’s fiscal year results for the year ended February 29, 2016. However, the change will impact the prior year comparability of each of the fiscal quarters and annual period in 2016 in future filings.
 
The Company believes this change will provide numerous benefits, including aligning its reporting periods to be more consistent with peer companies and improving comparability between periods.
 
Effective March 30, 2017, our name was changed from Luckycom Inc. to Luckycom Pharmaceuticals Inc.
 
Luckycom Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Luckycom Pharmaceuticals, Inc., was incorporated in Hong Kong as Goldsans Capital (Hong Kong) Limited (“Goldsans”) on November 08, 2011. Goldsans’s name was changed to Wudor Capital Hong Kong Limited on May 22, 2012 and subsequently to Luckycom Limited on June 28, 2013. Luckycom Limited became our wholly-owned subsidiary on July 3, 2013.
 
We are a shell company and have not begun operations.  We are presently negotiating with Luckycom Pharma Pvt Ltd, an Indian company indirectly owned by our Chief Executive Officer and sole director, to license the manufacture of generic anti-malarial and cholesterol drugs. Luckycom Pharma Pvt Ltd has the following drug manufacturing license from the Indian Food and Drug Administration:

 If we are successful in negotiating the license, our plan is to enter the generic market for antimalarial drugs in developing markets as well as generic cholesterol drugs for the US market after obtaining Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) approval. There is no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating the license and even if we were successful, that we will have sufficient resources and capital to implement our plans.

As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, we have no source of revenues and need additional cash resources to maintain our operations. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital or obtain necessary debt financing. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  We are presently dependent on our controlling shareholder to provide us funding for our daily operation and expenses, including professional fee and fees charged by regulators, although he is under no obligation to do so.
 
Accordingly, we may be required to cease operations at any time, if we do not have sufficient working capital to pay our operating costs for the next 12 months and we will require additional funds to pay our legal, accounting and other fees associated with our Company and our filing obligations under United States federal securities laws, as well as to pay our other accounts payable generated in the ordinary course of our business.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Given our current stage of development, we have not yet established commercial organization or distribution capabilities, nor have we entered into any partnership or co-promotion arrangements with an established pharmaceutical company. We plan to build up an international network after we achieve our financial targets.
Competition
 
The industry we plan to be in is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our products are likely to be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial, marketing, and human resources than we do (including, in some cases, substantially greater experience in clinical testing, manufacturing, and marketing of pharmaceutical products).
Employees
 
We do not have any employees, other than Mr. Kingrich Lee. We also engage a number of consultants.
