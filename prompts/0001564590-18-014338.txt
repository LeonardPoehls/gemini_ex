BUSINESS
 Company Overview
 Quality Systems, Inc., known to our clients as NextGen Healthcare, provides solutions on an integrated platform that enables our clients to target superior clinical and financial outcomes concurrent with improved physician and patient engagement.
 Our clients span the ambulatory care market from large multi-specialty to small single specialty practices and include networks of practices such as physician hospital organizations (“PHOs”), management service organizations (“MSOs”), independent physician associations (“IPAs”), accountable care organizations (“ACOs”), ambulatory care centers (“ACCs”), and community health centers (“CHCs”).
 
 
Our solutions start with a clinical and financial core that can be deployed effectively on premise and in the cloud. We optimize the core with an automation and workflow layer that gives our clients control over how platform capabilities are implemented to drive their desired outcomes. Our recently acquired cloud-based analytics and population health assets have been integrated into our core platform to allow our clients to improve results in both fee for service and fee for value environments. Finally, in support of extensibility, we surround the core with open web-based APIs and drive the secure exchange of health and patient data with connected health solutions

At the core of NextGen Healthcare
’s offerings are industry leading electronic health record (“EHR”) and practice management (“PM”) solutions that support the foundational clinical and financial activities of any ambulatory practice. We strive to enable our clients’ ability to maintain control of their organizational identity and destiny, rather than dictating a technology-driven road map. To meet our clients’ unique, evolving needs, NextGen Healthcare continues to expand and enrich our core offerings to create a comprehensive platform essential to our clients’ success in the new value-based environment. Our platform includes one of the industry’s most recognized suites of vendor-agnostic cloud-based interoperability tools as well as our recently acquired, cloud-based Population Health Management and Analytics platform which allows our clients to cost effectively manage populations of patients – improving outcomes and enhancing the quality of care rendered. Our mobile solution significantly enhances, automates and streamlines physician workflows reducing physician burnout and resulting physician attrition. 
 NextGen Healthcare has a history of enhancing our solutions through organic and inorganic activities. Over the last few years, we have entered into strategic transactions to complement and enhance our ambulatory market product portfolio. In October 2015, we divested our former Hospital Solutions division to focus exclusively on the ambulatory marketplace. In January 2016, we acquired HealthFusion Holdings, Inc. ("HealthFusion"), and its cloud-based EHR/PM. In April 2017, we acquired Entrada, Inc. ("Entrada"), a cloud-based, mobile platform for clinical documentation and collaboration. In August 2017, we acquired EagleDream Health, Inc. (“EagleDream”) and its cloud-based population health analytics, and in January 2018, we acquired Inforth Technologies (“Inforth”) for its specialty-focused clinical content.
 Quality Systems, Inc. was incorporated in California in 1974. Our principal offices are located at 18111 Von Karman Ave., Suite 800, Irvine, California, 92612. Our website is located at www.nextgen.com. We operate on a fiscal year ending on March 31.
 
Industry Background and Market Opportunity
 Significant challenges and thus opportunities exist today in the ambulatory healthcare market due to changes in regulations and requirements that have occurred over the past several years. We have seen the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ("HITECH Act") drive the adoption of EHRs, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (“ACA”) drive fundamental changes to the health insurance industry, and most recently, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”) driving value-based payment reform. We believe MACRA may be the most important of the three regulations for our market because it permanently changes how ambulatory healthcare providers are reimbursed by Medicare. It offers certainty and a timeline for the market’s move away from volume-based, fee-for-service models to value-based payment models that reward the delivery of lower cost, high quality care. 
 Healthcare information technology (“HCIT”) solutions, based on technology and services, have become the catalyst for propelling healthcare into this outcomes-based era and many of our clients are paving the way. As part of the healthcare

transformation that is taking place, providers will be held accountable for proactively managing the health of entire patient populations and delivering higher quality care at lower costs. As such, healthcare organizations are likely to invest in integrated healthcare technology and technology-enabled services that will help identify patient risk, engage patients, coordinate care, and determine when intervention is needed to improve clinical and financial outcomes. We are well positioned to provide healthcare professionals an integrated experience through our platform and solutions which we believe they need to enable them to achieve these goals. Additionally, we believe there will be an increasing demand for revenue cycle management services that are aligned and integrated with clinical technology solutions. Through our NextGen Connected Health Solutions, we provide our clients with the ability to securely share data and/or interoperate, which is essential to transforming the healthcare delivery system into one that provides better care, smarter spending, and healthier people.
 As healthcare continues to evolve, our focus is to help our clients adapt and thrive, by delivering the best clinical and financial outcomes possible. As a result, many of our clients are successfully participating in many advanced practice models leading and driving healthcare transformation.
 Our Strategy
 As many of the challenges of healthcare are uniquely local or regional, we believe that every client has the need and right to create its unique formula for success. Our strategy and platforms are singularly well suited to support our clients’ chosen approach. 
 Our strategy is to move beyond the traditional vendor-client relationship pervasive in the industry today by becoming a client’s trusted partner. We earn this status by offering solutions to our clients that allow them to thrive and grow by enabling them to control their outcomes and guide them in execution of their strategies. Much of the organizational changes we implemented over the last two years were aimed at creating client relationships that enable us to better understand each client’s unique needs. Our subject matter experts’ high touch coverage model supports very frequent client contact which allows them to become an extension of the client’s own staff. 
 Consequently, our strategic priorities are:
  
• | Focused on ambulatory care delivery – In October 2015, we sold our former Hospital Solutions division to focus on our core ambulatory clients. We believe it is essential to protect, build and sell new capabilities within our ambulatory client segment. We are focused on our core by increasing the overall quality and serviceability of our integrated solutions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enable our clients to control HOW they deliver clinical and financial outcomes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Keep the physician and the patient experience top of mind in everything we do.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Support pervasive interoperability (Connect to everyone…no matter what).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deliver actionable insights that deliver value regardless of where a group is on its journey to value-based care and where the data came from. We are migrating into applications, analytics and services that will enable our clients to proactively manage the health of patient populations. We are establishing strong development partnerships with our most innovative clients who are actively participating in shared-risk contracts, and working together with them to create progressive population health capabilities. We support extraordinary information sharing capabilities vital to managing patient populations through our interoperability offerings.

NextGen® Contract Audit & Recovery Service. This specialized service designed specifically for ambulatory-based practices and offered in coordination with a proven industry expert, changes the way providers and practices think about monitoring payer reimbursement. Unlike other payment review software tools that require clients to load their own contracts and fee schedules, perform analysis reports, and appeal findings with payers themselves. NextGen Healthcare provides a turn-key service solution that frees up valuable provider and staff time while maximizing recovery opportunity through years of experience and thousands of recovery efforts.
 
Professional Services. We offer a variety of professional services to our clients. Such services include training, project management, functional and detailed specification preparation, configuration, testing, and installation services. We generally charge for professional services on a time and materials basis, but we also charge on a fixed fee basis for projects with milestone payments utilizing mutually agreed upon functional and detailed specifications. We offer “E-learning” through the NextGen™ Learning Center, an online learning subscription service, which allows end-users to self-manage their learning. Our consulting services, which include physician, professional, and technical consulting, assist clients with optimizing their staffing and software solutions, enhancing financial and clinical outcomes, achieving regulatory requirements in the drive to value-based care, and meeting the evolving requirements of healthcare reform.
 Client Service and Support. Our technical services staff provides support for the dependable and timely resolution of technical inquiries from clients. Such inquiries are made via telephone, email and the internet. We offer several levels of support, with the most comprehensive service covering 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The charge for support and maintenance varies, depending upon the related level of service and other factors, including the related software license fee. By remaining current on support and maintenance fees, clients also receive access to future unspecified versions of the software, on a when-available basis, as part of support services. To further improve and simplify our client’s service and support experience, we recently implemented an Online Client Success Community that allows clients to access support, technical articles and documentation, and interact with peers one-on-one, all in one portal.
Proprietary Rights 
 We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products and services. To protect our proprietary rights, we enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees with whom such controls are relevant. In addition, we include intellectual property protective provisions in our client contracts. However, because the software industry is characterized by rapid technological change, we believe such factors as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, name recognition, and reliable product maintenance are more important to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position than the various legal protections of our technology.
 We rely on software that we license from third parties for certain components of our products and services. These components enhance our products and services and help meet evolving client needs. The failure to license any necessary technology, or to maintain our existing licenses, could result in reduced functionality of or reduced demand for our products.
 Although we believe our products and services, and other proprietary rights, do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the future. Any such claims may result in costly, time-consuming litigation and may require us to enter into royalty or cross-license arrangements.
 Competition
 The markets for healthcare information systems and services are intensely competitive and highly fragmented. Our traditional “full-suite” competitors in the healthcare information systems and services market include: Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., athenahealth, Inc., Cerner Corporation, eClinicalWorks, Epic Systems Corporation, GE Healthcare, Greenway Health, LLC, and Modernizing Medicine. Additionally, we face competition from “services-only” competitors like business process outsourcers, hosting providers and transcription companies. 
 The EHR, PM, interoperability, and connectivity markets, in particular, are subject to rapid changes in technology, and we expect that competition in these market segments could increase as new competitors enter the market. We believe our principal competitive advantages are depth and breadth of capabilities and configurability. 
 Research and Development
 The healthcare information management and computer software and hardware industries are characterized by rapid technological change requiring us to engage in continuing investments to update, enhance and improve our systems. During the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our gross research and development expenditures were $100.1 million $86.6 million, and $80.3 million, respectively, which included capitalized software costs of $18.9 million, $8.2 million, and $14.7 million, respectively. The majority of such expenditures are currently targeted on our software license and software related subscription services products lines.

Sales and Marketing
 We sell and market our products primarily through a direct sales force and to a lesser extent, through a reseller channel. Software license sales to resellers represented less than 10% of total revenue for each of the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
 Our direct sales force is comprised of subject matter experts by solution, as well as engaged account managers, all of whom deliver presentations to potential clients by demonstrating our systems and capabilities on the prospective client’s premises. System demonstrations for mobile workflow and analytics solutions is more web-based as these offerings tend to be targeted to larger practices. Sales efforts aimed at smaller practices can be performed on the prospective clients’ premises, or remotely via telephone or web-based presentations. Both the direct and reseller channel sales force concentrate on multi-product sales opportunities.
 Our sales and marketing employees identify prospective clients through a variety of means, including: referrals from existing clients, industry consultants, and contacts at professional society meetings and trade shows; web-based seminars; trade journal advertising; online advertising; public relations and social media campaigns; direct mail and email campaigns; and telemarketing. Resources have shifted more heavily to web-based marketing as we meet potential clients where they are and how they shop for services. Additionally, we focus on thought leadership and content marketing to highlight our industry knowledge, expertise and the successes of our diverse client base.
 Our sales cycle can vary significantly and typically ranges from six to twenty-four months from initial contact to contract execution. Software licenses are normally delivered to a client almost immediately upon receipt of an order and we normally receive up-front licensing fees. Implementation and training services are normally rendered based on a mutually agreed upon timetable. Clients have the option to purchase hosting and maintenance services which, if purchased, are invoiced on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. Subscriptions generally involve implementation and are billed monthly after implementation, or based on volume or throughput.
 We continue to concentrate our direct sales and marketing efforts on the ambulatory market from large multi-specialty organizations to small-single specialty practices and include clinically integrated networks of practices such as PHOs, MSOs, ACOs, ACCs, and CHCs. IPAs, PHOs and similar networks to which we have sold systems provide use of our software to those group and single physician practices associated with the organization or hospital on either a service basis or by directing us to contract with those practices for the sale of stand-alone systems.
 We have numerous clients and do not believe that the loss of any single client would adversely affect us. No client accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue during each of the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Substantially all of our clients are located in the United States.
 Employees
 As of March 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,830 full-time employees, of which 491 were based in Bangalore, India and substantially all other employees were based in the United States. We believe that our future success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining qualified sales, marketing and technical talent as well as other employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union.
