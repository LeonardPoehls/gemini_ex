ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OUR COMPANY
We are a specialty finance company with expertise in a range of asset classes. Our core business strategy is to leverage the proprietary resources of KKR Financial Advisors LLC (our “Manager”) with the objective of generating current income. Our holdings primarily consist of below investment grade syndicated corporate loans, also known as leveraged loans, high yield debt securities and interests in joint ventures and partnerships. The corporate loans that we hold are typically purchased via assignment or participation in the primary or secondary market.
The majority of our holdings consist of corporate loans and high yield debt securities held in collateralized loan obligation (“CLO”) transactions that are structured as on‑balance sheet securitizations and are used as long term financing for our investments in corporate debt. The senior secured debt issued by the CLO transactions is primarily owned by unaffiliated third party investors and we own the majority of the subordinated notes in the CLO transactions. As of December 31, 2016, our CLO transactions consisted of KKR Financial CLO 2012‑1, Ltd. (“CLO 2012‑1”), KKR Financial CLO 2013‑1, Ltd. (“CLO 2013‑1”), KKR Financial CLO 2013‑2, Ltd. (“CLO 2013‑2”), KKR CLO 9, Ltd. (“CLO 9”), KKR CLO 10, Ltd. (“CLO 10”), KKR CLO 15, Ltd. (“CLO 15”) and KKR CLO 16, Ltd. (“CLO 16”) (collectively the “Cash Flow CLOs”). During 2016, the Company called KKR 2016-1, Ltd. ("CLO 2016-1"), KKR Financial CLO 2007-1 (“CLO 2007-1") and KKR Financial CLO 2011-1 (“CLO 2011-1") and during 2015, the Company called KKR Financial CLO 2005-2, Ltd. (“CLO 2005-2"), KKR Financial CLO 2005-1, Ltd. ("CLO 2005-1") and KKR Financial CLO 2006-1, Ltd ("CLO 2006-1"), whereby we repaid all senior and mezzanine notes outstanding. We execute our core business strategy through our majority‑owned subsidiaries, including CLOs.
We are a Delaware limited liability company and were organized on January 17, 2007. We are the successor to KKR Financial Corp., a Maryland corporation. We intend to continue to operate so that we qualify, for United States federal income tax purposes, as a partnership and not as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation.
On April 30, 2014, we completed a merger whereby KKR Fund Holdings L.P. ("Parent"), a subsidiary of KKR & Co. L.P. ("KKR & Co." and, together with its subsidiaries, "KKR"), acquired all of our outstanding common shares through an exchange of equity through which our shareholders received 0.51 common units representing limited partner interests of KKR & Co. for each common share of KFN (the “Merger Transaction”). Following the Merger Transaction, Parent became the sole holder of all of our outstanding common shares. As of the close of trading on April 30, 2014, our common shares were delisted on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). However, our 7.375% Series A LLC Preferred Shares (“Series A LLC Preferred Shares”), senior notes and junior subordinated notes remain outstanding.
OUR MANAGER
We are externally managed and advised by our Manager pursuant to an amended and restated management agreement (as amended the “Management Agreement”). Our Manager is a subsidiary of KKR & Co.
Our Manager is responsible for our operations and performs all services and activities relating to the management of our assets, liabilities and operations. Pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement, our Manager provides us with our management team, along with appropriate support personnel. All of our executive officers are employees of KKR. Our Manager acts under the direction of our board of directors and is required to manage our business affairs in conformity with the investment guidelines that are approved by a majority of our board of directors.
The executive offices of our Manager are located at 555 California Street, 50th Floor, San Francisco, California 94104 and the telephone number of our Manager’s executive offices is (415) 315‑3620.
OUR STRATEGY
We seek to provide long‑term value by deploying capital opportunistically across capital structures and asset classes. As part of our strategy, we seek opportunities in those asset classes that can generate competitive leveraged risk‑adjusted returns, subject to maintaining our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). We currently expect future capital deployment to be focused on our credit‑oriented strategies, largely consisting of bank loans and high yield securities primarily through CLO subsidiaries.
6

Our Manager utilizes its access to the global resources and professionals of KKR in order to create a portfolio that is constructed to generate recurring cash flows, long‑term capital appreciation and overall competitive returns to investors. We make asset class allocation decisions based on various factors including: relative value, leveraged risk‑adjusted returns, current and projected credit fundamentals, current and projected supply and demand, credit risk concentration considerations, current and projected macroeconomic considerations, liquidity, all‑in cost of financing and financing availability, and maintaining our exemption from the Investment Company Act.
As of December 31, 2016, we determined that we operate our business through multiple reportable segments, which are differentiated primarily by their investment focuses.

• | Credit (“Credit”): The Credit segment includes primarily below investment grade corporate debt comprised of senior secured and unsecured loans, mezzanine loans, high yield bonds, private and public equity investments, and distressed and stressed debt securities.


• | Natural resources (“Natural Resources”): The Natural Resources segment consists of non‑operated working and overriding royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties, as well as interests in joint ventures and partnerships focused on the oil and gas sector.


• | Other (“Other”): The Other segment includes all other portfolio holdings, consisting solely of commercial real estate.

The segments currently reported are consistent with the way decisions regarding the allocation of resources are made, as well as how operating results are reviewed by the Company. For further financial information related to our segments, refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations-Segment Results” and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 13. Segment Reporting” of this Form 10‑K.
PARTNERSHIP TAX MATTERS
Non‑Cash “Phantom” Taxable Income
We intend to continue to operate so that we qualify, for United States federal income tax purposes, as a partnership and not as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation. Holders of our Series A LLC Preferred Shares are subject to United States federal income taxation and generally other taxes, such as state, local and foreign income taxes, on their allocable share of our gross ordinary income, regardless of whether or when they receive cash distributions. We generally allocate our gross ordinary income using a monthly convention, which means that we determine our gross ordinary income for the taxable year to be allocated to our Series A LLC Preferred Shares and then prorate that amount on a monthly basis. Our Series A LLC Preferred Shares will receive an allocation of our gross ordinary income. If the amount of cash distributed to our Series A LLC Preferred Shares in any year exceeds our gross ordinary income for such year, additional gross ordinary income will be allocated to the Series A LLC Preferred Shares in future years until such excess is eliminated. Consequently, in some taxable years, holders of our Series A LLC Preferred Shares may recognize taxable income in excess of our cash distributions. Furthermore, even if we did not pay cash distributions with respect to a taxable year, holders of our Series A LLC Preferred Shares may still have a tax liability attributable to their allocation of gross ordinary income from us during such year in the event that cash distributed in a prior year exceeded our gross ordinary income in such year.
Qualifying Income Exception
We intend to continue to operate so that we qualify, for United States federal income tax purposes, as a partnership and not as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation. In general, if a partnership is ‘‘publicly traded’’ (as defined in the Code), it will be treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes. A publicly traded partnership will be taxed as a partnership, however, and not as a corporation, for United States federal income tax purposes so long as it is not required to register under the Investment Company Act and at least 90% of its gross income for each taxable year constitutes ‘‘qualifying income’’ within the meaning of Section 7704(d) of the Code. We refer to this exception as the ‘‘qualifying income exception.’’ Qualifying income generally includes rents, dividends, interest (to the extent such interest is neither derived from the ‘‘conduct of a financial or insurance business’’ nor based, directly or indirectly, upon ‘‘income or profits’’ of any person), income and gains derived from certain activities related to minerals and natural resources, and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of stocks, bonds and real property. Qualifying income also includes other income derived from the business of investing in, among other things, stocks and securities. 
7

If we fail to satisfy the ‘‘qualifying income exception’’ described above, our gross ordinary income would not pass through to holders of our Series A LLC Preferred Shares and such holders would be treated for United States federal (and certain state and local) income tax purposes as shareholders in a corporation. In such case, we would be required to pay income tax at regular corporate rates on all of our net income. In addition, we would likely be liable for state and local income and/or franchise taxes on all of our income. Distributions to holders of our Series A LLC Preferred Shares would constitute ordinary dividend income taxable to such holders to the extent of our earnings and profits, and these distributions would not be deductible by us. If we were taxable as a corporation, it could result in a material reduction in cash flow and after-tax return for holders of our Series A LLC Preferred Shares and thus could result in a substantial reduction in the value of our Series A LLC Preferred Shares and any other securities we may issue.
Tax Consequences of Investments in Natural Resources and Real Estate
As referenced above, we have made certain investments in natural resources and real estate. It is likely that the income from natural resources investments will be treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a United States trade or business with respect to holders of our Series A LLC Preferred Shares that are not ‘‘United States persons’’ within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code. Furthermore, any notional principal contracts that we enter into, if any, in connection with investments in natural resources likely would generate income that would be treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a United States trade or business. Further, our investments in real estate through pass-through entities may generate operating income that is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a United States trade or business.
To the extent our income is treated as effectively connected income, a holder who is a non-United States person generally would be required to (i) file a United States federal income tax return for such year reporting its allocable share, if any, of our gross ordinary income effectively connected with such trade or business and (ii) pay United States federal income tax at regular United States tax rates on any such income. Moreover, if such a holder is a corporation, it might be subject to a United States branch profits tax on its allocable share of our effectively connected income. In addition, distributions to such a holder would be subject to withholding at the highest applicable federal income tax rate to the extent of the holder’s allocable share of our effectively connected income. Any amount so withheld would be creditable against such holder’s United States federal income tax liability, and such holder could claim a refund to the extent that the amount withheld exceeded such holder’s United States federal income tax liability for the taxable year.
If we are engaged in a United States trade or business, a portion of any gain recognized by an investor who is a non- United States person on the sale or exchange of its Series A LLC Preferred Shares may be treated for United States federal income tax purposes as effectively connected income, and hence such holder may be subject to United States federal income tax on the sale or exchange. Moreover, if the fair market value of our investments in United States real property interests, which include our investments in natural resources, real estate and REIT subsidiaries that invest primarily in real estate, represent more than 10% of the total fair market value of our assets, our Series A LLC Preferred Shares could be treated as United States real property interests. In such case, gain recognized by an investor who is a non-United States person on the sale or exchange of its Series A LLC Preferred Shares would be treated for United States federal income tax purposes as effectively connected income (unless our Series A LLC Preferred Shares are regularly traded on a securities market and the non-United States person owned 5% or less of the shares of our Series A LLC Preferred Shares during the applicable compliance period). We believe that the fair market value of our investments in United States real property interests represented more than 10% of the total fair market value of our assets during the fourth quarter of 2016. As a result, although the Treasury regulations are not entirely clear, the Series A LLC Preferred Shares (unless our Series A LLC Preferred Shares are regularly traded on a securities market and the non-United States person owned 5% or less of the shares of our Series A LLC Preferred Shares during the applicable compliance period) could be treated as United States real property interests. Moreover, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") could take the position that such shares would be treated as United States real property interests for the five years following the last date on which more than 10% of the total fair market value of our assets consisted of United States real property interests. If gain from the sale of our Series A LLC Preferred Shares is treated as effectively connected income, the holder may be subject to United States federal income and/or withholding tax on the sale or exchange.
In addition, all holders of our Series A LLC Preferred Shares will likely have state tax filing obligations in jurisdictions in which we have made investments in natural resources or real estate (other than through a REIT subsidiary). As a result, holders of our Series A LLC Preferred Shares will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions. Further, holders may be subject to penalties if they fail to comply with those requirements. Our current investments may cause our holders to have state tax filing obligations in the following states: Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. We may make investments in other states or non-U.S. jurisdictions in the future.
8

For holders of our Series A LLC Preferred Shares that are regulated investment companies, to the extent that our income from our investments in natural resources and real estate exceeds 10% of our gross income, then we will likely be treated as a ‘‘qualified publicly traded partnership’’ for purposes of the income and asset diversification tests that apply to regulated investment companies. Although the calculation of our gross income for purposes of this test is not entirely clear, it is possible we may be treated as a ‘‘qualified publicly traded partnership’’ for our 2016 tax year. However, no assurance can be provided that we will or will not be treated as a ‘‘qualified publicly traded partnership’’ in 2016 or any future year.
OUR INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT STATUS
Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is, holds itself out as being, or proposes to be, primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities and Section 3 (a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire “investment securities” (within the meaning of the Investment Company Act) having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer’s total assets (exclusive of United States government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis (the “40% test”). Excluded from the term “investment securities” are, among others, securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries unless the subsidiary is an investment company or relies on the exceptions from the definition of an investment company provided by Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act (a “fund”).
We are organized as a holding company. We conduct our operations primarily through our majority-owned subsidiaries. Each of our subsidiaries is either outside of the definition of an investment company in Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and 3 (a)(1)(C), described above, or excepted from the definition of an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We believe that we are not, and that we do not propose to be, primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities and we do not believe that we have held ourselves out as such. We intend to continue to conduct our operations so that we are not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
We monitor our holdings regularly to confirm our continued compliance with the 40% test. In calculating our position under the 40% test, we are responsible for determining whether any of our subsidiaries is majority-owned. We treat as majority-owned subsidiaries for purposes of the 40% test entities, including those that issue CLOs, in which we own at least 50% of the outstanding voting securities or that are otherwise structured consistent with applicable SEC staff guidance. Some of our majority-owned subsidiaries may rely solely on the exceptions from the definition of “investment company” found in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. In order for us to satisfy the 40% test, our ownership interests in those subsidiaries or any of our subsidiaries that are not majority-owned for purposes of the Investment Company Act, together with any other “investment securities” that we may own, may not have a combined value in excess of 40% of the value of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis and exclusive of United States government securities and cash items. However, many of our majority-owned subsidiaries either fall outside of the general definitions of an investment company or rely on exceptions provided by provisions of, and rules and regulations promulgated under, the Investment Company Act (other than Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act) and, therefore, the securities of those subsidiaries that we own and hold are not investment securities for purposes of the Investment Company Act. In order to conform to these exceptions, these subsidiaries are limited with respect to the assets in which each of them can invest and/or the types of securities each of them may issue. We must, therefore, monitor each subsidiary’s compliance with its applicable exception and our freedom of action relating to such a subsidiary, and that of the subsidiary itself, may be limited as a result. For example, our subsidiaries that issue CLOs generally rely on the exception provided by Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act, while our real estate subsidiaries, including those that are taxed as REITs for United States federal income tax purposes, generally rely on the exception provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. Each of these exceptions requires, among other things that the subsidiary (i) not issue redeemable securities and (ii) engage in the business of holding certain types of assets, consistent with the terms of the exception. Similarly, any subsidiaries engaged in the ownership of oil and gas assets may, depending on the nature of the assets, be outside the definition of an investment company or rely on exceptions provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) or Section 3(c)(9) of the Investment Company Act. While Section 3(c)(9) of the Investment Company Act does not limit the nature of the securities issued, it does impose business engagement requirements that limit the types of assets that may be held.
We do not treat our interests in majority-owned subsidiaries that are outside of the general definition of an investment company or that rely on Section 3(c)(5)(A), (B), (C) or Section 3(c)(9) of, or Rule 3a-7 under, the Investment Company Act as investment securities when calculating our 40% test.
We sometimes refer to our subsidiaries that rely on Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act as “CLO subsidiaries.” Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act is available to certain structured financing vehicles that are engaged in the business of holding financial assets that, by their terms, convert into cash within a finite time period and that 
9

issue fixed income securities entitling holders to receive payments that depend primarily on the cash flows from these assets, provided that, among other things, the structured finance vehicle does not engage in certain portfolio management practices resembling those employed by management investment companies (e.g., mutual funds). Accordingly, each of these CLO subsidiaries is subject to an indenture (or similar transaction documents) that contains specific guidelines and restrictions limiting the discretion of the CLO subsidiary and its collateral manager. In particular, these guidelines and restrictions prohibit the CLO subsidiary from acquiring and disposing of assets primarily for the purpose of recognizing gains or decreasing losses resulting from market value changes. Thus, a CLO subsidiary cannot acquire or dispose of assets primarily to enhance returns to the owner of the equity in the CLO subsidiary; however, subject to this limitation, sales and purchases of assets may be made so long as doing so does not violate guidelines contained in the CLO subsidiary’s relevant transaction documents. A CLO subsidiary generally can, for example, sell an asset if the collateral manager believes that its credit quality has declined since its acquisition or that the credit profile of the obligor will deteriorate and the proceeds of permitted dispositions may be reinvested in additional collateral, subject to fulfilling the requirements set forth in Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act and the CLO subsidiary’s relevant transaction documents. As a result of these restrictions, our CLO subsidiaries may suffer losses on their assets and we may suffer losses on our investments in those CLO subsidiaries.
We sometimes refer to our subsidiaries that rely on Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, as our “real estate subsidiaries.” Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act is available to companies that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate. While the SEC has not promulgated rules to address precisely what is required for a company to be considered to be “primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate,” the SEC’s Division of Investment Management, or the “Division,” has taken the position, through a series of no-action and interpretive letters, that a company may rely on Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act if, among other things, at least 55% of the company’s assets consist of mortgage loans, other assets that are considered the functional equivalent of mortgage loans and certain other interests in real property (collectively, “qualifying real estate assets”), and at least 25% of the company’s assets consist of real estate-related assets (reduced by the excess of the company’s qualifying real estate assets over the required 55%), leaving no more than 20% of the company’s assets to be invested in miscellaneous assets. The Division has also provided guidance as to the types of assets that can be considered qualifying real estate assets. Because the Division’s interpretive letters are not binding except as they relate to the companies to whom they are addressed, if the Division were to change its position as to, among other things, what assets might constitute qualifying real estate assets our REIT subsidiaries might be required to change its investment strategy to comply with the changed position. We cannot predict whether such a change would be adverse.
Based on current guidance, our real estate subsidiaries classify investments in mortgage loans as qualifying real estate assets, as long as the loans are “fully secured” by an interest in real estate on which we retain the unilateral right to foreclose. That is, if the loan-to-value ratio of the loan is equal to or less than 100%, then the mortgage loan is considered to be a qualifying real estate asset. Mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 100% are considered to be only real assets. Our real estate subsidiaries consider agency whole pool certificates to be qualifying real estate-related assets. Examples of agencies that issue whole pool certificates are the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Government National Mortgage Association. An agency whole pool certificate is a certificate issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States government or by a federally chartered entity, which represents the entire beneficial interest in the underlying pool of mortgage loans. By contrast, an agency certificate that represents less than the entire beneficial interest in the underlying mortgage loans is not considered to be a qualifying real estate asset, but is considered by our real estate subsidiaries to be a real estate-related asset.
Most non-agency mortgage-backed securities do not constitute qualifying real estate assets because they represent less than the entire beneficial interest in the related pool of mortgage loans; however, based on Division guidance, where our real estate subsidiaries’ investment in non-agency mortgage-backed securities is the “functional equivalent” of owning the underlying mortgage loans, our real estate subsidiaries may treat those securities as qualifying real estate assets. Moreover, investments in mortgage-backed securities that do not constitute qualifying real estate assets are classified by our real estate subsidiaries as real estate related assets. Therefore, based upon the specific terms and circumstances related to each non-agency mortgage-backed security that our real estate subsidiaries own, our real estate subsidiaries will make a determination of whether that security should be classified as a qualifying real estate asset or as a real estate-related asset; and there may be instances where a security is recharacterized from being a qualifying real estate asset to a real estate-related asset, or conversely, from being a real estate-related asset to being a qualifying real estate asset based upon the acquisition or disposition or redemption of related classes of securities from the same securitization trust. If our real estate subsidiaries acquire securities that, collectively, receive all of the principal and interest paid on the related pool of underlying mortgage loans (less fees, such as servicing and trustee fees, and expenses of the securitization), and that subsidiary has unilateral foreclosure rights with respect to those mortgage loans, then our real estate subsidiaries will consider those securities, collectively, to be qualifying real estate assets. If another entity acquires any of the securities that are expected to receive cash flow from the underlying mortgage loans, then our real estate subsidiaries will consider whether it has appropriate foreclosure rights with respect to the 
10

underlying loans and whether its investment is a first loss position in deciding whether these securities should be classified as qualifying real estate assets. If our real estate subsidiaries own more than one subordinate class, then, to determine the classification of subordinate classes other than the first loss class, our real estate subsidiaries will consider whether such classes are contiguous with the first loss class (with no other classes absorbing losses after the first loss class and before any other subordinate classes that our real estate subsidiaries own), whether our real estate subsidiaries own the entire amount of each such class and whether our real estate subsidiaries would continue to have appropriate foreclosure rights in connection with each such class if the more subordinate classes were no longer outstanding. If the answers to any of these questions is no, then our real estate subsidiaries would expect not to classify that particular class, or classes senior to that class, as qualifying real estate assets.
We have made or may make oil and gas and other mineral investments that are held through one or more subsidiaries and would refer to those subsidiaries as our “oil and gas subsidiaries”. Depending upon the nature of the oil and gas assets held by an oil and gas subsidiary, such oil and gas subsidiary may rely on Section 3(c)(5)(C) or Section 3(c)(9) of the Investment Company Act or may fall outside of the general definition of an investment company. An oil and gas subsidiary that does not engage primarily, propose to engage primarily or hold itself out as engaging primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities will be outside of the general definition of an investment company provided that it passes the 40% test. This may be the case where an oil and gas subsidiary holds a sufficient amount of oil and gas assets constituting real estate interests together with other assets that are not investment securities such as equipment. Oil and gas subsidiaries that hold oil and gas assets that constitute real property interests, but are unable to pass the 40% test, may rely on Section 3(c)(5)(C), subject to the requirements and restrictions described above. Alternately, an oil and gas subsidiary may rely on Section 3(c)(9) of the Investment Company Act if substantially all of its business consists of owning or holding oil, gas or other mineral royalties or leases, certain fractional interests, or certificates of interest or participations in or investment contracts relating to such royalties, leases or fractional interests. These various restrictions imposed on our oil and gas subsidiaries by the Investment Company Act may have the effect of limiting our freedom of action with respect to oil and gas assets (or other assets) that may be held or acquired by such subsidiary or the manner in which we may deal in such assets.
In addition, we anticipate that one or more of our subsidiaries will qualify for an exception from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act pursuant to either Section 3(c)(5)(A) of the 1940 Act, which is available for entities primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring notes, drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable, and other obligations representing part or all of the sales price of merchandise, insurance, and services, and/or Section 3(c)(5) (B) of the 1940 Act, which is available for entities primarily engaged in the business of making loans to manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers of, and to prospective purchasers of, specified merchandise, insurance, and services and, in each case, the entities are not engaged in the business of issuing redeemable securities, face-amount certificates of the installment type or periodic payment plan certificates. In order to rely on Sections 3(c)(5)(A) and (B) and be deemed “primarily engaged” in the applicable businesses, at least 55% of an issuer’s assets must represent investments in eligible loans and receivables under those sections. We intend to treat as qualifying assets for purposes of these exceptions the purchases of loans and leases representing part or all of the sales price of equipment and loans where the loan proceeds are specifically provided to finance equipment, services and structural improvements to properties and other facilities and maritime and infrastructure projects or improvements. We intend to rely on guidance published by the SEC or its staff in determining which assets are deemed qualifying assets.
As noted above, if the combined values of the securities issued to us by any non-majority-owned subsidiaries and our subsidiaries that must rely on Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, together with any other investment securities we may own, exceed 40% of the value of our total assets (exclusive of United States government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, we may be deemed to be an investment company. If we fail to maintain an exception, exemption or other exclusion from the Investment Company Act, we could, among other things, be required either (i) to change substantially the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being subject to the Investment Company Act or (ii) to register as an investment company. Either of these would likely have a material adverse effect on us, the type of investments we make, our ability to service our indebtedness and to make distributions on our shares, and on the market price of our shares and any other securities we may issue. If we were required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure (including our ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with certain affiliated persons (within the meaning of the Investment Company Act), portfolio composition (including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration) and other matters. Additionally, our Manager would have the right to terminate our Management Agreement effective the date immediately prior to our becoming an investment company. Moreover, if we were required to register as an investment company, we would no longer be eligible to be treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes. Instead, we would be classified as a corporation for tax purposes and would be able to avoid corporate taxation only to the extent that we were able to elect and qualify as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under applicable tax rules. Because our eligibility for RIC status would depend on our assets and sources of income at the time that we were required to 
11

register as an investment company, there can be no assurance that we would be able to qualify as a RIC. If we were to lose partnership status and fail to qualify as a RIC, we would be taxed as a regular corporation. See “Partnership Tax Matters- Qualifying Income Exception.”

We have not requested approval or guidance from the SEC or its staff with respect to our Investment Company Act determinations, including, in particular: our treatment of any subsidiary as majority-owned; the compliance of any subsidiary with Section 3(c)(5)(A), (B), (C) or Section 3(c)(9) of, or Rule 3a-7 under, the Investment Company Act, including any subsidiary’s determinations with respect to the consistency of its assets or operations with the requirements thereof; or whether our interests in one or more subsidiaries constitute investment securities for purposes of the 40% test. If the SEC were to disagree with our treatment of one or more subsidiaries as being majority-owned, excepted from the Investment Company Act pursuant to Rule 3a-7, Section 3(c)(5)(A), (B), (C), Section 3(c)(9) or any other exception, with our determination that one or more of our other holdings do not constitute investment securities for purposes of the 40% test, or with our determinations as to the nature of the business in which we engage or the manner in which we hold ourselves out, we and/or one or more of our subsidiaries would need to adjust our operating strategies or assets in order for us to continue to pass the 40% test or register as an investment company, either of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Moreover, we may be required to adjust our operating strategy and holdings, or to effect sales of our assets in a manner that, or at a time or price at which, we would not otherwise choose, if there are changes in the laws or rules governing our Investment Company Act status or that of our subsidiaries, or if the SEC or its staff provides more specific or different guidance regarding the application of relevant provisions of, and rules under, the Investment Company Act. The SEC published on August 31, 2011 an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to potentially amend the conditions for reliance on Rule 3a-7 and the treatment of asset-backed issuers that rely on Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act (the "3a-7 Release”).
The SEC, in the 3a-7 Release, requested public comment on the nature and operation of issuers that rely on Rule 3a-7 and indicated various steps it may consider taking in connection with Rule 3a-7 although it did not formally propose any changes to the rule. Among the issues for which the SEC has requested comment in the 3a-7 Release is whether Rule 3a-7 should be modified so that parent companies of subsidiaries that rely on Rule 3a-7 should treat their interests in such subsidiaries as investment securities for purposes of the 40% test. The SEC also published on August 31, 2011 a concept release seeking information about the nature of entities that invest in mortgages and mortgage-related pools and public comment on how the SEC staff’s interpretive positions in connection with Section 3(c)(5)(C) affect these entities, although it did not propose any new interpretive positions or changes to existing interpretive positions in connection with Section 3(c)(5) (C). Any guidance or action from the SEC or its staff, including changes that the SEC may ultimately propose and adopt to the way Rule 3a-7 applies to entities or new or modified interpretive positions related to Section 3(c)(5)(C), could further inhibit our ability, or the ability of a subsidiary, to pursue our current or future operating strategies, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
If the SEC or a court of competent jurisdiction were to find that we were required, but failed, to register as an investment company in violation of the Investment Company Act, we may have to cease business activities, we would breach representations and warranties and/or be in default as to certain of our contracts and obligations, civil or criminal actions could be brought against us, our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court were to require enforcement and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our business, any or all of which would have a material adverse effect on our business.
MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT
We are party to a Management Agreement with our Manager, pursuant to which our Manager will provide for the day‑to‑day management of our operations.
The Management Agreement requires our Manager to manage our business affairs in conformity with the Investment Guidelines that are approved by a majority of our board of directors. Our Manager acts under the direction of our board of directors. Our Manager is responsible for (i) the selection, purchase and sale of our investments, (ii) our financing and risk management activities and (iii) providing us with other management services.
The Management Agreement expired on December 31, 2016, was automatically renewed for a one‑year term expiring on December 31, 2017 and will be automatically renewed for a one year term on each anniversary date thereafter, unless terminated. Our board of directors review our Manager’s performance periodically and the Management Agreement may be terminated annually (upon 180 day prior written notice) upon the affirmative vote of at least two‑thirds of our independent directors, or by a vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding common shares, based upon (1) unsatisfactory performance by the Manager that is materially detrimental to us or (2) a determination that the management fees payable to our Manager are not fair, subject to our Manager’s right to prevent such a termination under this clause (2) by accepting a mutually 
12

acceptable reduction of management fees. We must provide a 180 day prior written notice of any such termination and our Manager will be paid a termination fee equal to four times the sum of the average annual base management fee and the average annual incentive fee for the two 12‑month periods preceding the date of termination, calculated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter prior to the date of termination.
We may also terminate the Management Agreement without payment of the termination fee with a 30 day prior written notice for cause, which is defined as (i) our Manager’s continued material breach of any provision of the Management Agreement following a period of 30 days after written notice thereof, (ii) our Manager’s fraud, misappropriation of funds, or embezzlement against us, (iii) our Manager’s gross negligence in the performance of its duties under the Management Agreement, (iv) the commencement of any proceeding relating to our Manager’s bankruptcy or insolvency, (v) the dissolution of our Manager, or (vi) a change of control of our Manager. “Cause” does not include unsatisfactory performance, even if that performance is materially detrimental to our business. Our Manager may terminate the Management Agreement, without payment of the termination fee, in the event we become regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Furthermore, our Manager may decline to renew the Management Agreement by providing us with a 180 day prior written notice. Our Manager may also terminate the Management Agreement upon 60 days prior written notice if we default in the performance of any material term of the Management Agreement and the default continues for a period of 30 days after written notice to us, whereupon we would be required to pay our Manager the termination fee described above.
We do not employ personnel and therefore rely on the resources and personnel of our Manager to conduct our operations. For performing these services under the Management Agreement, our Manager receives a base management fee and incentive compensation based on our performance. Our Manager also receives reimbursements for certain expenses.
Base Management Fee
We pay our Manager a base management fee quarterly in arrears in an amount equal to 1/4 of our equity, as defined in the Management Agreement, multiplied by 1.75%. We believe that the base management fee that our Manager is entitled to receive is generally comparable to the base management fee received by the managers of comparable externally managed specialty finance companies. Our Manager uses the proceeds from its management fee in part to pay compensation to its officers and employees who, notwithstanding that certain of them also are officers of us, receive no compensation directly from us.
For purposes of calculating the base management fee, our equity means, for any quarter, the sum of (i) the net proceeds from any issuance of our common shares, after deducting any underwriting discount and commissions and other expenses and costs relating to the issuance, (ii) the net proceeds of any issuances of preferred shares or trust preferred stock (iii) the net proceeds of any issuances of convertible debt or other securities determined to be “equity” by our board of directors, provided that such issuances are approved by our board of directors, and (iv) our retained earnings at the end of such quarter (without taking into account any non‑cash equity compensation expense incurred in current or prior periods), which amount shall be reduced by any amount that we pay for the repurchases of our common shares. The foregoing calculation of the base management fee is adjusted to exclude special one‑time events pursuant to changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), as well as non‑cash charges, after discussion between our Manager and our independent directors and approval by a majority of our independent directors in the case of non‑cash charges.
Our Manager is required to calculate the base management fee within forty‑five calendar days after the end of each quarter and deliver that calculation to us promptly. We are obligated to pay the base management fee within forty‑five calendar days after the end of each quarter. We may elect to have our Manager allocate the base management fee among us and our subsidiaries, in which case the fee would be paid directly by each entity that received an allocation.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, certain related party fees received by affiliates of our Manager were credited to us via an offset to the base management fee (“Fee Credits”). Specifically, as described in further detail under “The Collateral Management Agreements” below, a portion of the CLO management fees received by an affiliate of our Manager for certain of our CLOs were credited to us via an offset to the base management fee. For some of these CLOs, we hold less than 100% of the subordinated notes, with the remainder held by third parties. As a result, the amount of Fee Credits for each applicable CLO was calculated by taking the product of (x) the total CLO management fees received by an affiliate of our Manager during the period for such CLO multiplied by (y) the percentage of the subordinated notes of such CLO held by us. The remaining portion of the CLO management fees paid by each of these CLOs was not credited to us, but instead resulted in a dollar‑for‑dollar reduction in the interest expense paid by us to the third party holder of the CLO’s subordinated notes. For the year ended December 31, 2016, $7.1 million of base management fees, net of Fee Credits totaling $15.1 million, were earned by our Manager.

Reimbursement of Expenses
Because our Manager’s employees perform certain legal, accounting, due diligence tasks and other services that outside professionals or outside consultants otherwise would perform, our Manager is paid or reimbursed for the documented cost of performing such tasks, provided that such costs and reimbursements are no greater than those which would be paid to outside professionals or consultants on an arm’s‑length basis.
We also pay all operating expenses, except those specifically required to be borne by our Manager under the Management Agreement. The expenses required to be paid by us include, but are not limited to, rent, issuance and transaction costs incident to the acquisition, disposition and financing of our investments, legal, tax, accounting, consulting and auditing fees and expenses, the compensation and expenses of our directors, the cost of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, the costs associated with the establishment and maintenance of any credit facilities and other indebtedness of ours (including commitment fees, accounting fees, legal fees and closing costs), expenses associated with other securities offerings of ours, expenses relating to making distributions to our shareholders, the costs of printing and mailing reports to our shareholders, costs associated with any computer software or hardware, electronic equipment, or purchased information technology services from third party vendors, costs incurred by employees of our Manager for travel on our behalf, the costs and expenses incurred with respect to market information systems and publications, research publications and materials, and settlement, clearing, and custodial fees and expenses, expenses of our transfer agent, the costs of maintaining compliance with all federal, state and local rules and regulations or any other regulatory agency, all taxes and license fees and all insurance costs incurred by us or on our behalf. In addition, we will be required to pay our pro rata portion of rent, telephone, utilities, office furniture, equipment, machinery and other office, internal and overhead expenses of our Manager and its affiliates required for our operations. Except as noted above, our Manager is responsible for all costs incident to the performance of its duties under the Management Agreement, including compensation of our Manager’s employees and other related expenses, except that we may elect to have our Manager allocate expenses among us and our subsidiaries, in which case expenses would be paid directly by each entity that received an allocation. 
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred reimbursable expenses to our Manager of $3.8 million.
Incentive Compensation
In addition to the base management fee, our Manager receives quarterly incentive compensation in an amount equal to the product of: (i) 25% of the dollar amount by which: (a) our Net Income, before incentive compensation, per weighted average share of our common shares for such quarter, exceeds (b) an amount equal to (A) the weighted average of the price per share of the common stock of KKR Financial Corp. in its August 2004 private placement and the prices per share of the common stock of KKR Financial Corp. in its initial public offering and any subsequent offerings by KKR Financial Holdings LLC multiplied by (B) the greater of (1) 2.00% and (2) 0.50% plus one‑fourth of the Ten Year Treasury Rate for such quarter, multiplied by (ii) the weighted average number of our common shares. The foregoing calculation of incentive compensation will be adjusted to exclude special one‑time events pursuant to changes in GAAP, as well as non‑cash charges, after discussion between our Manager and our independent directors and approval by a majority of our independent directors in the case of non‑cash charges. In addition, any shares that by their terms are entitled to a specified periodic distribution, including our Series A LLC Preferred Shares, will not be treated as shares, nor included as shares offered or outstanding, for the purpose of calculating incentive compensation, and instead the aggregate distribution amount that accrues to these shares during the fiscal quarter of such calculation will be subtracted from our Net Income, before incentive compensation for purposes of clause (i)(A). The incentive compensation calculation and payment shall be made quarterly in arrears. For purposes of the foregoing: “Net Income” will be determined by calculating the net income available to shareholders before non‑cash equity compensation expense, in accordance with GAAP; and “Ten Year Treasury Rate” means the average of weekly average yield to maturity for United States Treasury securities (adjusted to a constant maturity of ten years) as published weekly by the Federal Reserve Board in publication H.15 or any successor publication during a fiscal quarter.
Our ability to achieve returns in excess of the thresholds noted above in order for our Manager to earn the incentive compensation described in the preceding paragraph is dependent upon various factors, many of which are not within our control.
Our Manager is required to compute the quarterly incentive compensation within forty‑five calendar days after the end of each fiscal quarter, and we are required to pay the quarterly incentive compensation with respect to each fiscal quarter within five business days following the delivery to us of our Manager’s written statement setting forth the computation of the incentive fee for such quarter. We may elect to have our Manager allocate the incentive fee among us and our subsidiaries, in which case the fee would be paid directly by each entity that received an allocation. 
14

For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Manager agreed to waive $16.1 million of incentive fees.
The Collateral Management Agreements
An affiliate of our Manager entered into separate management agreements with the respective investment vehicles for all of our Cash Flow CLOs pursuant to which it is entitled to receive fees for the services it performs as collateral manager for all of these CLOs, except for CLO 2011‑1. The collateral manager has the option to waive the fees it earns for providing management services for the CLO.
Fees Waived
No CLO management fees were waived during the year ended December 31, 2016.
Fees Charged and Fee Credits
During the year ended December 31, 2016, our Manager agreed to credit us for a portion of the CLO management fees received by an affiliate of our Manager from CLOs including CLO 2007‑1, CLO 2012‑1, CLO 9, CLO 10, CLO 11, CLO 13 and CLO 2016-1 via an offset to the base management fees payable to our Manager. As we own less than 100% of the subordinated notes of these CLOs (with the remaining subordinated notes held by third parties), we received a Fee Credit equal only to our pro rata share of the aggregate CLO management fees paid by these CLOs. Specifically, the amount of the reimbursement for each of these CLOs was calculated by taking the product of (x) the total CLO management fees received by an affiliate of our Manager during the period for such CLO multiplied by (y) the percentage of the subordinated notes of such CLO held by us. The remaining portion of the CLO management fees paid by each of these CLOs was not credited to us, but instead resulted in a dollar‑for‑dollar reduction in the interest expense paid by us to the third party holder of the CLO’s subordinated notes. Similarly, the Manager credited us the CLO management fees from CLO 2013‑1 and CLO 2013‑2 based on our 100% ownership of the subordinated notes in the CLO.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded aggregate collateral management fees expense totaling $23.4 million, of which we received Fee Credits totaling $15.1 million to offset the quarterly base management fees payable to our Manager.
COMPETITION
Our net income depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire assets at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs. A number of entities compete with us to make the types of investments that we make. We compete at varying levels with financial companies, oil and natural gas companies, public and private funds, commercial and investment banks and commercial finance companies. Some of the competitors are large and may have greater financial and technical resources and greater access to deal flow than are available to us. In addition, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds than us and access to financing sources that are not available to us. Finally, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us.
We cannot assure that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, as a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, and we do not offer any assurance that we will be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objectives.
STAFFING
We do not have any employees. We are managed by KKR Financial Advisors LLC, pursuant to the Management Agreement. Our Manager is a subsidiary of KKR & Co. and all of our executive officers are employees of KKR.
INCOME TAXES
We intend to continue to operate so that we qualify, for United States federal income tax purposes, as a partnership and not as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation. Therefore, we generally are not subject to United States federal income tax at the entity level, but are subject to limited state and foreign taxes. Holders of our Series A LLC Preferred Shares will be allocated a share of our gross ordinary income for our taxable year ending within or with their taxable year. Holders of our Series A LLC Preferred Shares will not be allocated any gains or losses from the sale of our assets. We hold equity interests in certain subsidiaries that have elected or intend to elect to be taxed as real estate investment trusts (“REIT subsidiaries”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). A REIT is not subject to United States federal income tax to the extent that it currently distributes its income and satisfies certain asset, income and ownership 
15

tests, and recordkeeping requirements, but it may be subject to some amount of federal, state, local and foreign taxes based on its taxable income.
We have domestic and foreign subsidiaries that are taxable as corporations for United States federal income tax purposes and thus are not consolidated by us for United States federal income tax purposes. For financial reporting purposes, current and deferred taxes are provided for on the portion of earnings recognized by us with respect to our interest in the domestic taxable corporate subsidiaries, because each is taxed as a regular corporation under the Code. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed based on temporary differences between the GAAP consolidated financial statements and the United States federal income tax basis of assets and liabilities as of each consolidated balance sheet date. The foreign corporate subsidiaries were formed to make certain foreign and domestic investments from time to time. The foreign corporate subsidiaries are organized as exempted companies incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands, and are anticipated to be exempt from United States federal and state income tax at the corporate entity level because they restrict their activities in the United States to trading in stock and securities for their own account. They generally will not be subject to corporate income tax in our financial statements on their earnings, and no provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016 was recorded; however, we will be required to include their current taxable income in our calculation of our gross ordinary income allocable to holders of our Series A LLC Preferred Shares.
CLO 2005‑1, CLO 2005‑2, CLO 2006‑1, CLO 2007‑1, CLO 2007‑ A, CLO 2009‑1 and CLO 2011‑1 are our foreign subsidiaries that elected to be treated as disregarded entities or partnerships for United States federal income tax purposes. These subsidiaries were established to facilitate securitization transactions, structured as secured financing transactions.
REIT MATTERS
We own equity interests in entities that have elected or intend to elect to be taxed as REITs. The Code requires, among other things, that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75% of a REIT’s total assets must be “real estate assets” as defined in the Code. The Code also requires that each year at least 75% of a REIT’s gross income come from real estate sources and at least 95% of a REIT’s gross income come from real estate sources and certain other passive sources itemized in the Code, such as dividends and interest. As of December 31, 2016, we believe our REITs were in compliance with all requirements necessary to be taxed as a REIT. However, the sections of the Code and the corresponding United States Treasury Regulations that relate to qualification and taxation as a REIT are highly technical and complex, and qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon the ability to meet various qualification tests imposed under the Code (such as those described above), including through actual annual operating results, asset composition, distribution levels and diversity of share ownership. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that any REIT in which we own an equity interest will be deemed to have been organized and to have operated, or to continue to be organized and operated, in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.
RESTRICTIONS ON OWNERSHIP OF OUR SHARES
Due to limitations on the concentration of ownership of a REIT imposed by the Code, our amended and restated operating agreement, among other limitations, generally prohibits any shareholder from beneficially or constructively owning more than 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of our Series A LLC Preferred Shares. Our board of directors has discretion to grant exemptions from the ownership limit, subject to terms and conditions as it deems appropriate.
REGULATION OF THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY
We have made investments in the oil and natural gas industry. The operations underlying these investments are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. In particular, oil and natural gas production and related operations are, or have been, subject to price controls, taxes and numerous other laws and regulations, including those relating to the transportation of oil and natural gas. All of the jurisdictions in which we own properties for oil and natural gas production have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process and the abandonment of wells. The operations underlying our investments are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in an area, and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas wells, as well as regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells.
16

The exploration, development and production operations underlying our investments in oil and gas are also subject to stringent federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety, the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may, among other things, require the acquisition of permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations; govern the amounts and types of substances that may be released into the environment; limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, wilderness areas or areas inhabited by endangered species; require investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions; impose obligations to reclaim and abandon well sites and pits; and impose specific criteria addressing worker protection. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas. These laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability.
The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in federal or state environmental laws and regulations or re‑interpretation of applicable enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly well construction, drilling, water management or completion activities, or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. The operators of the oil and gas properties in which we invest may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to their customers. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of those operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial liabilities.
Although we believe that the operations underlying our oil and gas investments are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on the value of our natural resources investments, our ability to use these investments as collateral, or our results of operations, such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted. Additionally, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non‑compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective.
IRAN SANCTIONS RELATED DISCLOSURE
Under the Iran Threat Reduction and Syrian Human Rights Act of 2012, or ITRA, which added Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, we are required to disclose in our annual or quarterly reports certain dealings or transactions that we or any of our affiliates engaged in during the previous reporting period involving Iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions. We have no disclosures to make with respect to us or our subsidiaries under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act during the year ended December 31, 2016. However, KKR & Co. has included such disclosure under Section 13(r) in Exhibit 99.1 to the annual report on Form 10-K as filed by KKR & Co. with the SEC on February 24, 2017.
