General Overview
 
DOCASA, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or “DOCASA”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 22, 2014, under the name of FWF Holdings, Inc. The Company changed its name on August 4, 2016. On August 4, 2016, the Company filed to change its fiscal year end from July 31st to August 31st.
 
On July 8, 2016, the Company experienced a change in control. Atlantik LP (“Atlantik”) acquired a majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company in accordance with a stock purchase agreement by and between Atlantik and Nami Shams (the “Seller”). On the closing date, July 8, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement, Atlantik purchased from the Seller 115,000,000 shares of the Company’s outstanding restricted common stock for $200,000, representing 75.8% of the Company’s outstanding common stock at that time.
 
On September 1, 2016, the Company acquired 99.8% of the voting stock of the Department of Coffee and Social Affairs Limited, a United Kingdom corporation (the “DEPT-UK”), and the Company agreed to issue DEPT-UK’s majority shareholder 170,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock—110,000,000 shares initially and 60,000,000 shares at a time determined by the Company’s Board of Directors but no later than August 31, 2017, which deadline was subsequently extended to August 31, 2018. Also on September 1, 2016, the Company acquired 115,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock from Atlantik in exchange for issuing Atlantik a promissory note for $320,000, which shares were then cancelled and which note has since been paid in full. As a result of the acquisition and the issuance of the initial 110,000,000 shares of common stock, and the cancellation of the 115,000,000 Atlantik shares, DEPT-UK is now the majority-owned subsidiary of the Company, and the Company experienced a change of control.
 
DEPT-UK formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Department of Coffee and Internal Affairs Limited (“DCIA”), on September 11, 2014, as filed with the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales. As of August 31, 2017, DCIA has had no operations or activity.
 
On April 5, 2017, the Company formed Department of Coffee and Social Affairs IL, Inc. (“DEPT-IL”), an Illinois corporation. 
 
On May 18, 2017, the Company formed Department of Coffee and Social Affairs White Space Limited (“DEPT-UKWS”), as filed with the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales. It is a subsidiary of DEPT-UK.
 
For financial reporting purposes, the acquisition of DEPT-UK and the change of control in connection with acquisition represented a "reverse merger" rather than a business combination, and DEPT-UK is deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction. For the periods subsequent to August 31, 2016, the acquisition is being accounted for as a reverse-merger and recapitalization. DEPT-UK is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes, and the Company (DOCASA, Inc., f/k/a FWF Holdings, Inc.) is the acquired company. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the operations that are reflected in the historical financial statements prior to the acquisition are those of DEPT-UK and have been recorded at the historical cost basis of DEPT-UK, and the financial statements after completion of the acquisition include the assets and liabilities of both the Company and DEPT-UK, and the historical operations of DEPT-UK prior to closing and operations of both companies from the closing of the acquisition.
 
We are currently devoting all of our efforts to the specialty coffee industry, specifically with company-operated stores. The Company generates revenue through sales at fifteen existing and seven currently under construction, company-operated stores in the United Kingdom and the United States (“US”). Our objective is to continue to be recognized as one of the upper tier specialty coffee retail operations in our market. Similar to leading operators, we sell our proprietary coffee and related products, and complementary food and snacks.
 
Our growth plans currently include expansion in certain European countries, the US and China. The Company also intends to pursue commercial agreements in other countries through strategic licensing agreements.

Overview
 
The Company’s main operational subsidiary, DEPT-UK (“Department of Coffee and Social Affairs Limited”), is a specialty artisan coffee company that serves premium single origin coffee to the United Kingdom’s discerning coffee drinkers as well as a selection of quality foods and coffee related retail products. Department of Coffee and Social Affairs served its first coffee in December 2010 and currently serves over 1,000,000 coffees per year. Department of Coffee and Social Affairs has fifteen existing and seven currently under construction, company-operated stores in the UK and the US, with an additional pipeline in the UK and the US and is seeking to rapidly grow to become the UK’s first truly nationwide specialty coffee company and to grow rapidly in select US cities.
 
To serve single origin coffee requires a sourcing chain that extends from the farm and workers, to picking and packaging, screening and grading, brokerage, shipping, roasting and – finally – coffee making. By working closely with our suppliers, we are able to bring some of the best coffees in the world to our customers. The grades of coffee we buy can only be produced by farmers who have a passion for their crop and are skilled in agribusiness. 
 
Good quality coffee does not mean you will personally like it. That is why we sample our coffee blindly and judge on flavor clarity and ability to pique our interest. Because we buy from specific producers, we expect distinct and definable flavors, and we want those to be complimentary – or to collide in an interesting way. We encourage our customers to try as many coffees as possible to learn which types of flavor they enjoy. You will find that there is no such thing as the universal ‘perfect’ coffee. There are flavors that suit certain times, moods, foods and occasions.
 
The Department of Coffee and Social Affairs brand is an award-winning and recognized leader in the UK specialty coffee market. The plan for the Company is to continue to grow by implementing an aggressive roll out of further shops in London, other UK cities and certain cities in the US. Department of Coffee and Social Affairs will offer even more consumers access to premium quality coffee.
 
Less known about Department of Coffee and Social Affairs is the meaning behind the second part of our name, “Social Affairs,” which refers partly to our customers’ coffee drinking experience, but also refers to our humanitarian work. Members of our team are both board members and volunteers for a number of UK and international charities. 
 
Company Operated Stores
 
Department of Coffee and Social Affairs operated stores are normally located in high foot traffic areas within close proximity to retail areas, transport stations, office buildings and university campuses. Due to our “no two shop looks alike policy,” we are able to turn unusual spaces into prime retail coffee locations. Our coffee shops range from 500 square feet to 3,000 square feet. The following our examples of spaces we have designed to fit the community our shops operates in.

Internal Affairs

Department of Coffee and Social Affairs began to serve the needs of large organizations that were looking to create a better working environment for their employees by providing a quality coffee offering in their workplaces. It is an uncompromising Department of Coffee and Social Affairs offering.
 
After several months of research, we found out that 90% of employees are more productive if they can get a beverage they want at work and that 91% of employees believe that a hot-beverage break is a good way to reduce stress before starting a new activity and saw an increase in employee satisfaction after such a break. In addition, four out of five employees preferred better coffee options at work, and having such an option makes them less likely to want to leave the office.

Our first Department of Coffee and Internal Affairs shop (which uses our Department of Coffee and Social Affairs brand) opened in July 2014, and we now operate 4 internal coffee bars across London.

Members Club
 


13


In 2017, Department of Coffee and Social Affairs created Department of Coffee and Social Affairs Members Club, a new co-working concept inspired by customers who enjoy using coffee shops as a place to work and host business meetings. With 1.91 million professional freelancers in the UK, and a clear shift to the gig economy, the increasing demand for flexible workspace is constantly growing. We see this as an opportunity to capitalise on this demand by dedicating space in specific sites to cater for those professionals who need alternative co-working space. The Members Club will sell monthly and yearly memberships creating a highly scalable annuity style income for the Company and will be incorporated under the subsidiary, Department of Coffee and Social Affairs White Space Limited.
 
The first Members Club will open in Manchester, UK, in December 2017. The 3,000-square foot space will house a coffee shop at the front and state of the art co-working space at the back, the entire site having been designed to embody everything that a customer loves about working in a coffee shop but with the additional office amenities that nomadic workers need. 
 
This new concept allows the Company to pursue larger locations in city centers, and this a concept that we will actively look to roll out across the country in line with our national rollout strategy. We will seek to launch the concept in Chicago in 2018.
 
Additional Revenue Segments
 
Roasted Coffee Beans
 
To serve single origin coffee requires a sourcing chain that extends from the farm and workers, to picking and packaging, screening and grading, brokerage, shipping, roasting and – finally – coffee making. By working closely with our partners, we are able to bring some of the best coffees in the world to our customers. The grades of coffee we buy can only be produced by farmers who have a passion for their crop and are skilled in agribusiness. Because we buy from specific producers, we expect distinct and definable flavors and we want those to be complementary – or to collide in an interesting way. We encourage our customers to try as many coffees as possible to learn which types of flavor they enjoy. There are flavors that suit certain times, moods, foods and occasions. Our selection of single origin coffee beans are exclusive to Department of Coffee and Social Affairs and are only available in our stores and on our website.
Home Barista
 
Our stores offer a range of home coffee brewing equipment and coffee accessories. We also offer a variety of Coffee School courses each week where customers learn the science and craft of espresso and home brewing techniques, customers enroll and pay via our website and courses are conducted after normal business hours in our various store locations. We want to be able to provide our customers with a specialty coffee drinking experience at home. Coffee School is also becoming an increasingly popular corporate event for companies looking to provide a different group experience for their staff and clients.

Customers
 
Our customer base is widespread with people from various backgrounds frequenting our shops. Due to the growth of the specialty coffee market and the rise of the conscious consumer, our customer base demands a high-quality product that is ethically sourced and produced. Coffee is an industry with no clear demographic, spanning all age groups and affluence and is a product that spans every corner of the UK and US. 
Sales Targets
 
Our target customer market in the UK and US is coffee drinkers. As more consumers become interested in coffee and move towards the higher-end of the specialty coffee spectrum, our target market increases. We aim to educate consumers about the difference between specialty grade coffee and below standard grade coffee and, through this, we assist in raising their coffee expectations. In addition to serving specialty coffee, we offer our range of high-end teas to attract tea drinkers who also have high expectations of their tea providers enabling us to reach an even broader market.
Social Impact
 
“We measure our commercial success equally to our social impact; we think that every company, everywhere, should do the same.”
 - Chairman Professor Stefan Allesch-Taylor CBE
 
We are committed to being a socially impactful company in the communities we work in and in certain places around the world that need positive change. Our Social Impact strategy is an important element of our overall business strategy. We believe through our Social Impact Strategy our stakeholders benefit, including employees, partners, customers, suppliers, shareholders and others.

ABOUT THE UK COFFEE MARKET
 
After 18 years of considerable continued growth, the coffee shop market is one of the most successful in the UK economy. The total UK coffee shop market delivered a growth of 12% in turnover to reach £8.9 billion (US$11.7 billion) in 2016. The branded coffee shop chains had an estimated annual turnover of £3.7 billion (US$4.9 billion) in and sales growth of 11.2% in 2016. The branded coffee shop chain market is forecasted to reach £6 billion (US$7.9 billion) annual revenue by 2021.
 
The UK has become a nation of coffee drinkers, with coffee shop visitors purchasing an estimated 2.3 billion cups of coffee per year in stores. Consumers are more knowledgeable and empowered with choice than ever before, and the rise of artisan coffee has driven the desire for premium quality coffee. As coffee shops are increasingly viewed as the local of choice by British consumers, coffee shops are set to outnumber pubs in the UK by 2030.
 
The UK coffee shop market will continue to grow with the market forecasted to exceed £16 billion (approximately US$21.4 billion) per annum by 2025 (source: Allegra Strategies, World Coffee Portal, Project Café 2017 UK Report). 
 
(Data obtained from reports and other information compiled by Allegra Strategies, World Coffee Portal 2017.)
 
FUTURE OF THE UK COFFEE MARKET
 
According to Allegra Strategies, “Small and medium sized boutique chains are gaining momentum and driving the comparable sales growth across the sector, ahead of the leading chains. Increased merger and acquisition activity throughout 2016 signifies the strength of the vibrant coffee shop market in the UK. Allegra identifies that a new 5th Wave, The Business of Coffee, represents an important new era for the global coffee industry. The 5th Wave encompasses a compelling combination of all four previous waves – Tradition, Chains, Artisan, and Science – where high quality boutique chains will be a major feature of the market going forward. These highly targeted operators are adopting a more advanced set of business practices to deliver authentic, artisan concepts at scale.” (Source: Allegra Strategies, World Coffee Portal, Project Café 2017 UK Report). 
ABOUT THE US COFFEE MARKET
 
In 2016, the US coffee shop market had considerable growth with a 7.4% increase in revenue to reach US$41 billion, this is forecasted to reach US $85 billion by 2025. The coffee-focused-chain segment had an 8.2% revenue growth to reach US$29 billion. 
 
The US is a nation of coffee drinkers consuming 23 cups of coffee a week in various location with regular coffee shop visitors consuming 4 cups of coffee per week in coffee shops on average. According to Allegra Strategies, “With the emergence of the rapidly expanding artisan scene, a growing number of Americans are becoming coffee connoisseurs demanding greater quality coffee wherever they are. 55% of the 5,000+ consumers surveyed by Allegra WCP state they would be willing to spend more for higher quality coffee in coffee shops, giving an average price ceiling of $3.18 per beverage. Millennials are the driving force in the increase of espresso-based beverage consumption and are much more likely to order cappuccino (19%) than a filter coffee (8%).” (Source: Allegra Strategies, World Coffee Portal, Project Café 2017 US Report). 
 
More people are drinking coffee out-of-home than ever, reaching a high of 46% in 2017. Low unemployment and continued economic growth have enabled consumers to increase their coffee consumption out-of-home, and this trend should continue in 2017. Shifts in household composition are favoring the steady rise in out-of-home coffee sales. The growing importance of millennials in the US also supports more out-of-home and premium coffee consumption. They now make up the largest generation in US history, and next year, they will have the highest combined spending power of any living generation. (Source: Euromonitor, Rabobank 2016)
 
FUTURE OF THE US COFFEE MARKET
 
With the rise of an espresso-based coffee culture and increased consumer expectations for quality and experience, Allegra World Coffee Portal observes higher quality coffee standards across the market. The coffee shop market is moving beyond artisan coffee to a greater level of professionalism. In an environment transformed by technology, urbanization and instant access to information, consumers are becoming more sophisticated. Boutique chains are adopting more refined business practices to deliver higher standards of quality coffee. (Source: Allegra Strategies, World Coffee Portal, Project Café 2017 US Report). 
COMPETITION AND COMPETITVE EDGE
 
The UK and US coffee shop market is made up of branded coffee-focused and food-focused chains, independent specialty shops and chains and non-specialist including supermarket cafes, department store cafes, retail shops with cafes, pubs, hotels, motorway service stations, forecourts and fast food outlets. Certain branded coffee-focused chains currently have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do, however their ability to deliver specialty quality coffee is limited. Our competitive edge is our focus and ability to deliver consistent quality coffee to consumers. This is done through the hiring and training of highly skilled baristas, sourcing only the highest-grade single origin green coffee available and working with experts in the specialty coffee industry to continually innovate the way we make and talk about coffee.

Unlike other independent and specialty shops and chains who have shifted their proposition towards being more closely identified to a restaurant than a coffee shop, we have continued to focus predominately on coffee and in perfecting our craft. In doing so, our customer base understands our quality proposition and it enables us to create a differentiator with prospective landlords specifically seeking a quality coffee shop offering for premium locations rather than a restaurant offering.
 
Many of our competitors have a formulaic approach to site design and layout whereas our commitment is to ensure that no two shop designs will ever look alike because we always seek to be ‘the’ local coffee shop. We look for design and material originality that reflects the location wherever the shop is and that the unique design reflects the local community the shops are operating in is a part of our brand positioning. This is one of our unique selling points. According to Allegra Strategies, “Coffee shops are playing an increasingly important role in the UK, enhancing the social vibrancy of a community and contributing significantly to employment and the economy. The third wave/specialty coffee has raised consumer expectations about coffee quality and store design.” (Source: Allegra Strategies, World Coffee Portal, Project Café 2016 UK Report)
 
The ‘Social Affairs’ part of our name alludes to our desire to be a socially impactful company locally, nationally and internationally, consumers in the UK and elsewhere are holding their choice brands to an increasingly higher standard of social awareness and impact. We see our increasing social impact as both good business and a wholly responsible way of being part of a broader community. We see the benefit of nurturing and maintaining this culture in our Company every day.
 
Customers
