ITEM 1. BUSINESS
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Plan of Operations
 
We were founded in 2008 as Sweet Spot Games, Inc., a Nevada corporation on June 2, 2008. We changed our name to Greenfield Farms Food, Inc. ("Greenfield") on March 31, 2011. In October 2013, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") with COHP, LLC, through which the Company acquired certain of the assets and liabilities of COHP including the operations of Carmela's Pizzeria through a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary Carmela's Pizzeria CO, Inc. Carmela's Pizzeria presently has three Dayton, Ohio area locations offering authentic New York style pizza. Carmela's offers a full service menu for Dine In, Carry out and Delivery as well as pizza buffets in select stores. Carmela's has been noted in Dayton Daily News as one of "The Best Pizzerias" in Dayton.
 
The Carmela's Pizzeria assets and liabilities were acquired in exchange for 1,000 shares of our newly issued Series C Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series C") that converted on October 31, 2013 into 53,965,942 shares of common stock upon the effective date of a 1 for 100 reverse split. In addition, COHP and its assigns received warrants to purchase a total of 53,965,942 shares of our common stock exercisable for a period of five years in the amounts and exercise prices as follows: 59,962 at $3.00; 59,962 at $6.00; and 59,962 at $7.50. The value of these assets was $1,586,599 at December 31, 2013, which represents the fair market value of the common stock and warrants issued in the acquisition at their issuance dates.
 
For SEC reporting purposes, Carmela's is treated as the continuing reporting entity that acquired GRAS as a result of the Carmela's acquisition transaction. The quarterly and annual reports filed after the transaction, beginning with this report, have been prepared as if Carmela's (accounting acquirer) were the legal successor to the Company's reporting obligation as of the date of the acquisition. Therefore, all financial statements filed subsequent to the transaction reflect the historical financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Carmela's for all periods prior to the share exchange; and consolidated with the Company from the date of the share Exchange. All share and per share amounts of Carmela's have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the legal capital structure of the Company.
 
The Company will continue to explore other business opportunities in complementary food related business segments much like the acquisition of Carmela's Pizzeria, although no further agreements have been reached.
 
In their opinion letter for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, our auditors included an explanatory paragraph that disclosed conditions that raise concerns about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Please refer to the audited financial statements and accompanying auditors report within this filing.
 
Our Operations
 
On November 28, 2017, the Company entered into a Letter of Intent (the “LOI”) with Ngen Technologies USA Corp, (“Ngen”), a Texas corporation. Ngen engages in the business of 3D technologies including automotive, mobile and display. Ngen has also developed new state-of-art automotive muffler/silencer technologies (hereinafter, the “Business”). The Company will acquire, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, and liabilities, one hundred percent (100%) of Ngen’s muffler technology Business. The acquisition includes Ngen’s rights under its contracts, licenses, purchase orders, privileges, franchises and agreements, and all assets and property owned and used by Ngen in the Business. Clifford Rhee (“Rhee”) and Edward Carter (“Carter”) were named to the Company’s Board of Directors in conjunction with the LOI.
 
Effective December 7, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the issuance of 1,000 shares of Series F Preferred Stock (the “Series F Preferred Stock Shares”) to Rhee, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, or his assigns, in consideration of his role in the proprietary and intellectual aspects of Ngen that has been assigned to the Corporation. The issuance of these shares was made in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as there was no general solicitation, and the transactions did not involve a public offering.

On January 4, 2018, the Company entered into Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Ngen, Rhee and Carter. The Company, Ngen, Rhee and Carter are referred to as the Parties. Pursuant to the Agreement, the parties agreed that the Company purchased assets of Ngen related to Ngen’s automotive technology Business in consideration of the Company issuing 500 shares of the Company’s Series E Preferred Stock to Rhee and 500 shares of the Company’s Series E Preferred Stock to Carter. The Series E Preferred Stock in the aggregate is convertible into 85% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company, on a post conversion basis. 
 
The issuance of these shares was made in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as there was no general solicitation, and the transactions did not involve a public offering.
 
The remainder of this Annual Report filed on this Form 10-K, discusses the prior business of the Company.
 
Through January 4, 2018, the Company offered two restaurant concepts in our three Company owned restaurant locations including:
 

· | A full-service dining room menu comprising a Carmela's Pizzeria and including a limited pizza buffet and alcohol and a Sports Grill. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | A smaller Carmela's Pizzeria with full menu dining room including limited pizza buffet, delivery and carry-out; as well as a drive-thru in certain locations.

 
In addition, our locations may offer a "Carmela's Treats" walk-up window offering ice cream style dessert treats offered to both diners within the restaurant or patrons looking for dessert only offerings.
 
Each concept is designed to offer quality meals at affordable prices with an emphasis on efficiencies in food ordering, preparation and service. We believe that the overall configuration of each concept results in simplified scalable operations, increased efficiency and improved consistency and quality of our food products. Our restaurants may be configured to adapt to a variety of building shapes and sizes by utilizing the restaurant concept that best fits the individual location. This offers the flexibility necessary for our concepts to be operated at a multitude of locations.
 
In addition to offering New York style pizza for dine-in, carry-out or delivery at select locations, our buffet menu offers a variety of pizza toppings and special combinations of toppings. Stores offering full buffets also offer pasta, salads, comfort foods, and in a family-oriented atmosphere.
 
During 2015, we added a catering division offered through our stores for everything from simple pick up to full services weddings and other occasions. The catering menu presently offers five different price points ranging from $4.50 per person for salad, pasta and breadsticks to $12 per person for a full meal including roast beef with au jus. Customers can also order from a variety of appetizers, salads, entrée's and sides in portions designed for 8, 15 and 25 plus people including Italian classics and other non-Italian items.
 
Food and Supply Distribution
 
We currently purchase our restaurant supplies from local wholesale food distributors in the Dayton, Ohio area. If we are able to expand through franchising, we will identify a suitable partner for outsourcing our warehousing and distribution services to a reputable and experienced restaurant distribution company. There are many regional and national companies to choose from that we believe will offer significant choice to tailor a program necessary for our specific needs. We may also choose to outsource our product sourcing, purchasing, quality assurance, franchisee order and billing services, and logistics support functions. These decisions will be made as we move forward with development of our franchising program in the future.
Advertising
 
Through December 2017, we advertised locally in the Dayton, Ohio area mainly through direct marketing. As we move to create our franchising concept, we will be required to communicate a common brand message at the regional, local market and restaurant levels, to create and reinforce a strong, consistent marketing message to consumers in order to create successful franchise start-ups and garner sufficient market share. It is typical to require franchisees to participate in, and contribute to, an advertising program as part of their franchising fees. Once again, these decisions will be made as we move forward with development of our franchising program in the future.

Government Regulation
 
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting the operation of our restaurants. Each restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety, sanitation, wage and hour, alcoholic beverage, building and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. Difficulties in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant or require the temporary or permanent closing of existing restaurants in a particular area.
 
We will be subject to Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") regulation and to various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises once our planned franchising program commences. The FTC will require us to furnish to prospective franchisees the FDD containing prescribed information. Substantive state laws that regulate the franchise or franchisee relationship presently exist in a number of states, and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for further federal regulation of the franchisor-franchisee relationship in certain respects. Some foreign countries also have disclosure requirements and other laws regulating franchising and the franchisor-franchisee relationship.
 
Competition
 
The restaurant industry, and specifically the pizza restaurant industry, is intensely competitive with respect to price, service, location and food quality, and there are many well-established competitors with substantially greater brand recognition and financial and other resources than us. Competitors include a large number of easily recognizable international, national and regional restaurant and pizza chains, as well as local restaurants and pizza operators. Some of our competitors may be better established in the markets where our restaurants are or may eventually be located. Within the pizza segment of the restaurant industry, we believe currently that our primary competitors are national pizza chains. As we move forward with franchising plans, our competition will potentially include regional chains, local restaurants as well as "take and bake" concept offerings. We also compete against the frozen pizza products available to consumers in all manners of retail stores. A change in the pricing or other market strategies of one or more of our competitors could have an adverse impact on our sales and earnings.
Employees
 
In addition to our executive officers, as of December 31, 2017 we had twenty-three full-time and sixteen part-time employees at our three Company owned restaurants. None of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements.
