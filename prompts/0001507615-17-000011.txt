ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Tesoro Logistics LP (“TLLP” or the “Partnership”) is a fee-based, growth-oriented Delaware limited partnership formed in December 2010 by Tesoro Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary, Tesoro Logistics GP, LLC (“TLGP”), our general partner, to own, operate, develop and acquire logistics assets. 
We completed our initial public offering (the “Initial Offering”) in April 2011. We have since acquired additional assets from Tesoro, and those assets, liabilities and results of operations are collectively referred to as the “Predecessors.” Our financial information for all periods, except the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016, includes the historical results of our Predecessors and the results of TLLP. The financial statements of our Predecessors have been prepared from the separate records maintained by Tesoro and may not necessarily be indicative of the conditions that would have existed or the results of operations if our Predecessors had been operated as an unaffiliated entity. Most notably, this applies to the revenue associated with the terms of the commercial agreements as our Predecessors generally did not record revenue for transactions with Tesoro in the Terminalling and Transportation segment.
We are a full-service logistics company operating primarily in the western and mid-continent regions of the United States. We own and operate networks of crude oil, refined products and natural gas pipelines, terminals with dedicated and non-dedicated storage capacity for crude oil and refined products, rail facilities with loading and off-loading capabilities, marine terminals, a trucking fleet, natural gas processing and fractionation complexes. Our assets are organized in three segments: Gathering, Processing and Terminalling and Transportation. Segment disclosures are discussed in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Our business is affected by seasonality due to weather conditions and access restrictions, as well as supply and demand.
We generate revenues by charging fees for gathering crude oil and natural gas, for terminalling, transporting and storing crude oil and refined products and for processing natural gas. We do not engage in the trading of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs or refined products; therefore, we have minimal direct exposure to risks associated with commodity price fluctuations as part of our normal operations. However, we may be subject to nominal commodity risk exposure due to pipeline loss allowance provisions in many of our pipeline gathering and transportation contracts and a nominal amount of condensate retained as part of our 


natural gas gathering services. In the event actual measured pipeline losses are less than the loss allowance we are able to sell the natural gas and crude oil at market price adjusted for premiums; correspondingly, when actual losses exceed loss allowances we purchase natural gas or crude oil at market prices. The natural gas imbalance exposes us to some fluctuations in natural gas prices. At December 31, 2016, the estimated value of the imbalance was less than $1 million. For the NGLs that we handle under keep-whole agreements, the Partnership has a fee-based processing agreement with Tesoro, which minimizes the impact of commodity price movements during the annual period subsequent to renegotiation of terms and pricing. 
We are not a taxable entity for federal and state income tax purposes. Instead, each partner is required to take into account its share of our income, gain, loss and deduction in computing its federal and state income tax liabilities, regardless of whether we make cash distributions to the partner. The taxable income reportable to each partner takes into account differences between the tax bases and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities, the acquisition price of their units and the taxable income allocation requirements under the partnership agreement.
NORTH DAKOTA GATHERING AND PROCESSING ASSETS. On November 21, 2016, we agreed to acquire crude oil, natural gas and produced water gathering systems and two natural gas processing facilities from Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation, GBK Investments, LLC and WBI Energy Midstream, LLC (“North Dakota Gathering and Processing Assets”) for total consideration of approximately $700 million. The North Dakota Gathering and Processing Assets include over 650 miles of crude oil, natural gas, and produced water gathering pipelines, 170 MMcf per day of natural gas processing capacity and 18.7 Mbpd of fractionation capacity in the Sanish and Pronghorn fields of the Williston Basin in North Dakota. The acquisition closed on January 1, 2017. With this acquisition, we expanded the assets in our Gathering and Processing segments located in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota to further grow our integrated, full-service logistics capabilities in support of third-party demand for crude oil, natural gas and water gathering services as well as natural gas processing services. In addition, this extends our capacity and capabilities by adding new origin and destination points for our common carrier pipelines in North Dakota and extends our crude oil, natural gas and water gathering and associated gas processing footprint to enhance and improve overall basin logistics efficiencies.

GATHERING - VOLUMES TRANSPORTED IN 2016
HIGH PLAINS SYSTEM. We own and operate a common carrier crude oil gathering and transportation system consisting of common carrier pipelines in North Dakota and Montana (the “High Plains Pipeline”), which gathers and transports crude oil into major regional takeaway pipelines and refining centers including Tesoro’s North Dakota refinery in Mandan. The Partnership transports crude oil processed at Tesoro’s Mandan refinery via the High Plains System.
As part of our High Plains System, we own storage facilities with tanks located in strategic areas of the Bakken Region basins, which provide our customers access to and from multiple pipelines and rail loading facilities in the area. The current storage capacity is over 1 million barrels.
In addition, we own and operate a truck-based crude oil gathering operation. This operation uses a combination of proprietary and third-party trucks, all of which we dispatch and schedule. These trucks gather and transport crude oil from well sites or nearby collection points in the Bakken Region and deliver it to our High Plains Pipeline and third-party destinations. We charge per-barrel tariffs and service fees for receiving and transporting crude oil, for dispatching and scheduling proprietary and third-party trucks and for use of our field unloading tanks.
NORTH DAKOTA GATHERING SYSTEMS. The North Dakota Gathering Systems are crude oil, natural gas and produced water gathering systems located in and around the Williston Basin in McLean County, North Dakota, including the North Dakota Gathering and Processing Assets. These systems are primarily supported by long-term, fee-based, crude oil and natural gas gathering agreements with minimum volume commitments and backed by acreage dedications from producers. Included are the recently acquired North Dakota Gathering and Processing Assets. 


UINTA BASIN GATHERING SYSTEM.  The Uinta Basin Gathering System consists of natural gas gathering systems and compression assets located in northeast Utah, which include low-pressure natural gas gathering pipeline and compression. We refer to these individual gas gathering systems collectively as the Uinta Basin Gathering System. The gathering system is primarily supported by acreage dedications and long-term, fee-based gathering agreements that contain annual inflation adjustment mechanisms and minimum volume commitments.
GREEN RIVER SYSTEM. The Green River System, located in western Wyoming, consists of three integrated assets: the Green River Gathering Assets, the assets owned by Rendezvous Pipeline Company, LLC (“Rendezvous Pipeline”) and assets owned by RGS. In addition to gathering natural gas, the system also gathers crude oil production, transports the crude oil to an interstate pipeline interconnect, and gathers and handles produced and flowback water associated with well completion and production activities.

• | The Green River Gathering Assets are primarily supported by Life-of-Reserves Contracts and long-term, fee-based gathering agreements with minimum volume commitments.


• | Rendezvous Pipeline provides gas transportation services from the Blacks Fork processing complex in southwest Wyoming to an interconnect with the Kern River Pipeline. The capacity on the Rendezvous Pipeline system is contracted under long-term take or pay transportation contracts.


• | RGS, which operates the infrastructure that transports gas from certain fields to several re-delivery points, including natural gas processing facilities that are owned by TLLP or a third party.

VERMILLION GATHERING SYSTEM.  The Vermillion Gathering System consists of gas gathering and compression assets located in southern Wyoming, northwest Colorado and northeast Utah.

GATHERING ASSETS PIPELINE MILES BY SYSTEM

(a) | Includes the gathering pipelines associated with the North Dakota Gathering and Processing Assets acquisition.


Our natural gas operations are affected by seasonal weather conditions and certain access restrictions imposed by the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) on federal lands to protect migratory and breeding patterns of native species. During the winter months, our customers typically reduce drilling and completion activities due to adverse weather conditions. Also, access restrictions imposed by the BLM reduce our ability to complete expansion projects and connect to newly completed wells. We mitigate these seasonal risks in affected areas through prudent planning and coordination with our customers to ensure expansion projects are completed prior to these periods. Condensate sales, however, tend to increase in the first quarter of each year, as the colder ground causes more condensates to fall out of the gas stream in our gathering system. However, this impact is minimal and we expect such seasonality to diminish as we continue expanding our existing assets or acquire additional assets outside of the affected areas.


 PROCESSING
Our Processing segment consists of the Vermillion processing complex (“Vermillion Complex”), the Uinta Basin processing complex (“Uinta Basin Complex”), the Blacks Fork processing complex (“Blacks Fork Complex”), the Emigrant Trail processing complex (“Emigrant Trail Complex”) as well as the Robinson Lake processing complex (“Robinson Lake Complex”) and the Belfield processing complex (“Belfield Complex”) that were acquired with the North Dakota Gathering and Processing Assets. We process gas for certain producers under keep-whole processing agreements. Approximately 45-50% of our plant production is currently supported by long-term, fee-based processing agreements with minimum volume commitments. The graph below shows the throughput capacities of our processing and fractionation facilities.
VERMILLION COMPLEX. The Vermillion Complex, located in Sweetwater County, Wyoming, consists of two processing trains. A portion of the natural gas volumes we gather at the Vermillion Complex is available to us pursuant to natural gas gathering agreements with several producer customers. The plant receives the majority of its gas from the Vermillion sub-basin in southern Wyoming and northwest Colorado.
UINTA BASIN COMPLEX. The Uinta Basin Complex, located in Uintah County, Utah, consists of five separate processing trains with raw gas inlet processing capacity. The 


complex receives the majority of its gas from various natural gas fields located in the Uinta Basin.
BLACKS FORK COMPLEX. The Blacks Fork Complex, located in Sweetwater and Uinta Counties, Wyoming, consists of three separate gas processing trains and a NGLs fractionation facility. The complex receives the majority of its gas from various gas fields located in the Green River Basin of western Wyoming.
EMIGRANT TRAIL COMPLEX. The Emigrant Trail Complex, located in Uinta County, Wyoming, consists of one cryogenic gas processing train. The complex receives the majority of its gas from various gas fields located in the Green River Basin of western Wyoming.
ROBINSON LAKE COMPLEX. The Robinson Lake Complex is located in Montrail County, North Dakota, and consists of compression units, propane refrigeration plants and a fractionation plant. The complex receives the majority of its gas from various gas fields located in the Williston Basin of North Dakota.
BELFIELD COMPLEX. The Belfield Complex, located in Billings, Dun and Stark Counties, North Dakota, consists of compression units, propane refrigeration plants and a fractionation plant. The complex receives the majority of its gas from various gas fields located in the Williston Basin of North Dakota.

CALIFORNIA MARINE TERMINALS. The California marine terminals support Tesoro’s Los Angeles refinery, Tesoro’s Martinez refinery and third parties. The Los Angeles marine terminals consist of three marine terminals and a marine storage facility. One of the marine terminals, Berth 121, is capable of handling VLCC class ships. Another marine terminal is Terminal 2, which is comprised of a berth dock and is adjacent to our Terminal 3 storage facility. The third is a marine terminal currently subleased from Tesoro pursuant to a master lease between Tesoro and the City of Long Beach, which expires in 2032. Tesoro currently leases a portion of Berth 121 from the City of Long Beach under a lease that expires in 2023 and a portion of Terminal 2, which is currently under a month to month lease while negotiations are underway to provide a long term lease. Until the effectiveness of the subleases between Tesoro and us for these properties, we are operating the assets pursuant to the Berth 121 Operating Agreement and the Terminals 2 and 3 Operating Agreement.
The Martinez Crude Oil Marine Terminal is located near Tesoro’s Martinez refinery and consists of a dock, storage tanks and related pipelines that receive crude oil from vessels for delivery to Tesoro’s refinery and a third-party terminal. The dock and related leasehold improvements are situated on an offshore parcel of land that is currently being 


leased by Tesoro from the California State Lands Commission under a term lease. The lease will be legally transferred to us upon renewal and approval from the California State Lands Commission. We are currently operating these assets under the terms of the Amorco Marine Terminal Use and Throughput Agreement entered into in April 2012.
On November 21, 2016, we purchased the assets located at the Avon marine terminal facility (the “Avon Marine Terminal Assets”), consisting of a berth dock that serves as the main shipping and receiving point for Tesoro’s Martinez refinery for the transfer of waterborne non-crude feedstocks, is the principal outbound marine delivery point for refined products and is directly connected to the refined products tankage located at the refinery. We are currently operating these assets under the terms of the Avon Marine Terminal Operating Agreement. 
In connection with the Avon Marine Terminal Assets, Tesoro Logistics Operations LLC, our subsidiary (“TLO”), entered into an operating agreement that is intended to be treated as a contribution of the Avon Marine Terminal Assets (including all economic benefits and burdens relating to those assets) as of the closing date on November 21, 2016.
CALIFORNIA TERMINALS AND STORAGE FACILITIES. We own and operate terminals and storage facilities in California. In addition, we operate a refined products terminal in Stockton, which we lease from the Port of Stockton under a five-year lease expiring in 2019 that can be extended for up to two additional five-year terms. We own and operate a terminal located at Tesoro’s Martinez refinery that includes a refined products truck rack, a NGLs truck facility and a NGLs rail loading and unloading facility. The Martinez terminal receives refined products via pipelines from the Martinez refinery, some of which we blend with renewable fuels before delivery. In November 2015, we purchased crude oil and refined product storage and pipeline assets in Los Angeles, California from Tesoro, which included crude oil, feedstock, and refined product storage tanks with combined capacity of 6.6 million barrels and a

50% fee interest in a pipeline that transports jet fuel from Tesoro’s Los Angeles refinery to the Los Angeles International Airport.
On November 21, 2016, we purchased certain terminalling and storage assets located in Martinez, California (the “Northern California Terminalling and Storage Assets”) from Tesoro consisting of:

• | tankage with shell capacity of approximately 5.8 million barrels of crude oil, feedstock, and refined product storage located at Tesoro’s Martinez refinery, together with all related equipment and ancillary facilities used for the operation thereof (the “Tankage”);


• | the Avon Marine Terminal Assets; and


• | the pipelines, causeway and ancillary equipment that connect the Tankage to the Avon Marine Terminal, as well as all associated easements, permits and licenses.

In connection with the Northern California Terminalling and Storage Assets purchase, we entered into certain commercial agreements with Tesoro and its subsidiary Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company (“TRMC”), our general partner and TLO, as applicable.
CARSON CALIFORNIA PETROLEUM COKE HANDLING AND STORAGE FACILITY. We own and operate a coke handling and storage facility adjacent to Tesoro’s Los Angeles refinery. Tesoro has committed to throughput 2,600 metric tons per day of petroleum coke at this facility. We lease the facility to Tesoro under an agreement that expires in 2024 and can be renewed by Tesoro for six renewal terms of ten years each.
IDAHO TERMINALS. We own and operate terminals in Idaho, including terminals located in Boise, Pocatello and Burley. Refined products received at the Idaho terminals are distributed by Tesoro and third parties through the truck loading racks.


UTAH TERMINALS. We own and operate a refined products terminal adjacent to Tesoro’s Utah refinery. The Salt Lake City terminal has the ability to receive refined products directly from the refinery via pipeline. Refined products received and ethanol blended into gasoline at this terminal are sold locally and regionally by Tesoro through our truck loading rack. We own and operate a crude oil truck terminal that allows us to receive black wax crude oil for Tesoro’s use in its Utah refinery. We also own and operate a crude oil and refined products storage facility in Salt Lake City with 878,000 barrels of storage capacity. The storage tanks are connected to Tesoro’s Salt Lake City refinery through our four interconnecting pipelines, but are not directly connected to our Salt Lake City terminal. The storage facility supplies crude oil to Tesoro’s Utah refinery and receives refined and intermediate products from the refinery.
WASHINGTON TERMINALS AND STORAGE FACILITIES. Our Washington terminals consist of three terminals located in Vancouver, Pasco and Anacortes. The Vancouver terminal is leased from the Port of Vancouver under a 10-year lease expiring in 2026, with one 10-year renewal option. We receive gasoline and distillates at this terminal from Tesoro’s Anacortes refinery through a third-party common carrier pipeline. We also have access to a marine dock owned by the Port of Vancouver under a non-preferential berthing agreement, which allows us to receive gasoline and distillates from Tesoro’s Anacortes refinery and third-party sources through barge deliveries and to transport those refined products to the terminal on proprietary interconnecting pipelines. Refined products received at this terminal are sold locally by Tesoro and others through our truck loading rack or through barges loaded at the Port of Vancouver dock.
Our Pasco terminal is supplied with refined products from our Northwest Products Pipeline and can receive refined products delivered by barge via the Columbia River. The refined products received by the terminal can be delivered to Spokane, Washington via the Northwest Products Pipeline or distributed via truck from its truck rack.

COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS
TESORO
Tesoro accounted for $715 million, or 59%, of our total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2016. No revenue was recorded by the Predecessors for transactions with Tesoro in the Terminalling and Transportation segment prior to the Acquisitions from Tesoro during the year ended December 31, 2016.
We process gas for certain producers under keep-whole processing agreements. Under a keep-whole agreement, normally a producer would transfer title of the NGLs produced during gas processing and the processor, in exchange, would deliver to the producer natural gas with a BTU content equivalent to the NGLs that would be removed. However, TLLP entered into an agreement with Tesoro, which transfers the commodity risk exposure associated with these keep-whole processing agreements from TLLP to Tesoro (the “Keep-Whole Commodity Agreement”). Under the Keep-Whole Commodity Agreement with Tesoro, Tesoro pays TLLP a processing fee for NGLs related to keep-whole agreements and delivers the replaced natural gas to the producers on behalf of TLLP. TLLP pays Tesoro a marketing fee in exchange for assuming the commodity risk. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our keep-whole agreements.
We have various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with Tesoro, under which we provide pipeline transportation, trucking, terminal distribution, storage services and coke handling services to Tesoro. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our commercial agreements.
THIRD-PARTIES
Third-party agreements accounted for $505 million, or 41%, of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. Of this, approximately $337 million is under committed arrangements in which we provide gathering, processing, pipeline transportation, terminal distribution and storage services. QEP Resources accounted for 13% of our total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2016.
COMPETITION
GATHERING. Our High Plains System competes with a number of transportation companies for gathering and transporting crude oil produced in the Bakken Region. We may also compete for opportunities to build gathering lines from producers or other pipeline companies. Other companies have existing pipelines that are available to ship crude oil and continue to (or have announced their intent to) expand their pipeline systems in the Bakken Region. We also compete with third-party carriers that deliver crude oil by truck.


Although we compete for third-party shipments of crude oil on our High Plains System, our contractual relationship with Tesoro under our Transportation Services Agreement (High Plains System) (the “High Plains Pipeline Transportation Services Agreement”) and our connection to Tesoro’s Mandan refinery provide us a strong competitive position in the Bakken Region.
Our competitors for natural gas gathering include other midstream companies and producers. Competition for natural gas volumes is primarily based on reputation, commercial terms, reliability, service levels, flexibility, access to markets, location, available capacity, capital expenditures and fuel efficiencies. In addition to competing for crude oil and natural gas volumes, we face competition for customer markets, which is primarily based on the proximity of the pipelines to the markets, price and assurance of supply.
PROCESSING. Our competitors for processing include other midstream companies and producers. Competition for natural gas volumes is primarily based on reputation, commercial terms, reliability, service levels, flexibility, access to markets, location, available capacity, capital expenditures and fuel efficiencies. In addition to competing for natural gas volumes, we face competition for customer markets, which is primarily based on the proximity of the facilities to the markets, price and assurance of supply.
TERMINALLING AND TRANSPORTATION. Our competition primarily comes from independent terminal and pipeline companies, integrated petroleum companies, refining and marketing companies and distribution companies with marketing and trading arms. Competition in particular geographic areas is affected primarily by the volumes of refined products produced by refineries located in those areas, the availability of refined products and the cost of transportation to those areas from refineries located in other areas.
We may compete with third-party terminals for volumes in excess of minimum volume commitments under our commercial agreements with Tesoro and third-party customers as other terminals and pipelines may be able to supply Tesoro’s refineries or end user markets on a more competitive basis, due to terminal location, price, versatility and services provided. If Tesoro’s customers reduced their purchases of refined products from Tesoro due to the increased availability of less expensive product from other suppliers or for other reasons, Tesoro may only receive or deliver the minimum volumes through our terminals (or pay the shortfall payment if it does not deliver the minimum volumes), which would decrease our revenues.
PIPELINE, TERMINAL AND RAIL SAFETY
PIPELINE SAFETY. Our pipelines, gathering systems and terminal operations are subject to increasingly strict safety 



December 31, 2016 | 11


BUSINESS

laws and regulations. The transportation and storage of refined products, natural gas and crude oil involve a risk that hazardous liquids or natural gas may be released into the environment, potentially causing harm to the public or the environment. The U.S. Department of Transportation, through the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) and state agencies, enforces safety regulations governing the design, construction, operation, maintenance, inspection and management of our pipeline and storage facilities. These regulations require the development and implementation of pipeline integrity management programs, which include the inspection and testing of pipelines and the investigation of anomalies and if necessary, corrective action. These regulations also require that pipeline operation and maintenance personnel meet certain qualifications and that pipeline operators develop comprehensive spill response plans, including extensive spill response training for pipeline personnel.
We may incur significant costs and liabilities associated with repair, remediation, preventative or mitigation measures associated with our pipelines. These costs and liabilities might relate to repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program, as well as lost cash flows resulting from shutting down our pipelines during such repairs. Additionally, if we fail to comply with PHMSA or comparable state regulations, we could be subject to penalties and fines. If future PHMSA regulations impose new regulatory requirements on our assets, the costs associated with compliance could have a material effect on our operations.
While we operate and maintain our pipelines consistent with applicable regulatory and industry standards, we cannot predict the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives, which could have a material effect on our operations, particularly by extending more stringent and comprehensive safety regulations to pipelines and gathering lines not previously subject to such requirements. While we expect any legislative or regulatory changes to allow us time to comply with new requirements, costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on our operations.
NATURAL GAS PROCESSING SAFETY. Our natural gas processing plants and operations are subject to safety regulations under the U.S. Occupational Safety Health Administration (“OSHA”) and comparable state and local requirements. A number of our natural gas processing facilities are also subject to OSHA’s process safety management regulations and the Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) risk management plan requirements. Together these regulations are designed to prevent or minimize the probability and consequences of an accidental release of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. A number of our facilities are also regulated under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (“Homeland Standards”), which are 


designed to regulate the security of high-risk chemical facilities. Our natural gas processing plants and operations are operated in a manner consistent with industry safe practices and standards.
TERMINAL SAFETY. Our operations are subject to regulations under OSHA and comparable state and local regulations. Our terminal facilities are operated in a manner consistent with industry safe practices and standards. The storage tanks that are at our terminals are designed for crude oil and refined products and are equipped with appropriate controls that minimize emissions and promote safety. Our terminal facilities have response and control plans, spill prevention and other programs to respond to emergencies. Our terminals are regulated under the Homeland Standards or U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Transportation Act, which are designed to regulate the security of high–risk chemical facilities.
RAIL SAFETY. Our rail operations are limited to loading and unloading rail cars at our facilities. Generally, rail operations are subject to federal, state and local regulations. We believe our rail car loading and unloading operations meet or exceed all applicable regulations.
RATE AND OTHER REGULATIONS
GENERAL INTERSTATE REGULATION. Our High Plains Pipeline, Northwest Products Pipeline and two other interstate pipelines are common carriers subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The FERC regulates interstate transportation on our crude oil transportation and gathering pipelines and Northwest Products Pipeline under the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the “EPAct”), and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. The ICA and its implementing regulations require that tariff rates for interstate service on oil pipelines, including interstate pipelines that transport crude oil and refined products (collectively, “Petroleum Pipelines”), be just and reasonable and non-discriminatory, and that we file such rates and terms and conditions of service with the FERC. Under the ICA, shippers may challenge new or existing rates or services. The FERC is authorized to suspend the effectiveness of a challenged rate for up to seven months, though rates are typically not suspended for the maximum allowable period. A successful rate challenge could result in Petroleum Pipelines paying refunds for the period that the rate was in effect and/or reparations for up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint. There are no pending challenges or complaints regarding our current tariffs.
Certain interstate Petroleum Pipeline rates in effect at the inception of the EPAct are deemed to be just and reasonable under the ICA. These rates are referred to as grandfathered rates. Our rates for interstate transportation service on the Northwest Products Pipeline are grandfathered. The FERC allows for an annual rate change

under its indexing methodology, which applies to transportation on our High Plains Pipeline and Northwest Products Pipeline.
We own a natural gas pipeline in Wyoming. Under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (the “NGA”), FERC has authority to regulate natural gas companies that provide natural gas pipeline transportation services in interstate commerce. Federal regulation of interstate pipelines extends to such matters as rates, services, and terms and conditions of service; the types of services offered to customers; the certification and construction of new facilities; the acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of facilities; the maintenance of accounts and records; relationships between affiliated companies involved in certain aspects of the natural gas business; the initiation and continuation of services; market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases or transportation of natural gas; and participation by interstate pipelines in cash management arrangements. The FERC prohibits natural gas companies from unduly preferring or unreasonably discriminating against any person with respect to pipeline rates or terms and conditions of service. Under the NGA, the rates for service on interstate facilities must be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory. The FERC has granted the Rendezvous Pipeline market-based rate authority, subject to certain reporting requirements. If the FERC were to suspend Rendezvous Pipeline’s market-based rate authority, it could have an adverse impact on our revenue associated with the transportation service.
INTRASTATE REGULATION. The intrastate operations of our High Plains Pipeline in North Dakota and our refined products pipeline in Alaska are subject to regulation by the North Dakota Public Service Commission (“NDPSC”) and the Regulatory Commission of Alaska, respectively. Applicable state law requires that:

• | pipelines operate as common carriers;


• | access to transportation services and pipeline rates be non-discriminatory;


• | transported crude oil volumes be apportioned without unreasonable discrimination if more crude oil is offered for transportation than can be transported immediately; and


• | pipeline rates be just and reasonable.

PIPELINES. We operate our crude oil gathering pipelines and the Northwest Products Pipeline as common carriers pursuant to tariffs filed with the FERC, and the NDPSC for the High Plains Pipeline. The High Plains Pipeline offers tariffs from various locations in Montana and North Dakota to a variety of destinations, which are utilized by Tesoro and various third parties. Tesoro has historically shipped the majority of the volumes transported on the High Plains Pipeline, which is expected to continue in 2017. The Northwest Products Pipeline extends from Salt Lake City, Utah to Spokane, Washington and offers tariffs from various 


locations to a variety of destinations, which serves both third-party customers and Tesoro. We have additional pipelines that provide gathering of condensate in Wyoming and other pipelines that provide crude oil gathering in North Dakota.
The FERC and state regulatory agencies generally have not investigated rates on their own initiative absent a protest or a complaint by a shipper. Tesoro has agreed not to contest our tariff rates for the term of our commercial agreements. However, our pipelines are common carrier pipelines, and we may be required to accept additional third-party shippers who wish to transport through our system. The FERC or the NDPSC could investigate our rates at any time. If an interstate rate for service on the High Plains Pipeline or Northwest Products Pipeline were investigated, the challenger would have to establish that there has been a substantial change since the enactment of the EPAct, in either the economic circumstances or the nature of the service that formed the basis for the rate. If our rates are investigated, the inquiry could result in a comparison of our rates to those charged by others or to an investigation of our costs.
Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the FERC’s jurisdiction. Although the FERC has not made formal determinations with respect to all of the facilities we consider to be gathering facilities, we believe that our natural gas pipelines meet the FERC’s traditional tests to determine that they are gathering pipelines and are, therefore, not subject to FERC jurisdiction.
States may regulate gathering pipelines. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based regulation. Our natural gas and crude oil gathering operations are subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in most of the states in which we operate. These statutes generally require our gathering pipelines to take natural gas or crude oil without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. The regulations under these statutes can have the effect of imposing some restrictions on our ability as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to gather natural gas or crude oil. Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies. To date, there has been no adverse effect to our systems due to these regulations.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS
GENERAL. Our operations of pipelines, terminals and associated facilities in connection with the storage and transportation of crude oil, refined products and biofuels as well as our operations of gathering, processing and associated facilities related to the movement of natural gas are subject to extensive and frequently-changing federal, state and local laws, regulations, permits and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment. Among other 



December 31, 2016 | 13


BUSINESS

things, these laws and regulations govern the emission or discharge of pollutants into or onto the land, air and water, the handling and disposal of solid, liquid, salt water and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination. Compliance with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain, operate and upgrade equipment and facilities. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment. These requirements may also significantly affect our customers’ operations and may have an indirect effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. However, we do not expect such effects will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Under the Third Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement (“Amended Omnibus Agreement”) and the Carson Assets Indemnity Agreement, Tesoro indemnifies us for certain matters, including environmental, title and tax matters associated with the ownership of our assets at or before the closing of the Initial Offering and the subsequent Acquisitions from Tesoro. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 for additional information regarding the Amended Omnibus Agreement and Carson Assets Indemnity Agreement.
AIR EMISSIONS AND CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATIONS. Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act and comparable state and local statutes. Under these laws, permits may be required before construction can commence on a new source of potentially significant air emissions, and operating permits may be required for sources that are already constructed. If regulations become more stringent, additional emission control technologies may be required to be installed at our facilities and our ability to secure future permits may become less certain. Any such future obligations could require us to incur significant additional capital or operating costs.
The EPA has undertaken significant regulatory initiatives under authority of the Clean Air Act’s New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration program (“NSR/PSD”) in an effort to further reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter. These regulatory initiatives have been targeted at industries with large manufacturing facilities that are significant sources of emissions, such as refining, paper and pulp, and electric power generating industries. The basic 


premise of these initiatives is the EPA’s assertion that many of these industrial establishments have modified or expanded their operations over time without complying with NSR/PSD regulations adopted by the EPA that require permits and new emission controls in connection with any significant facility modifications or expansions that can result in emission increases above certain thresholds. As part of this ongoing NSR/PSD regulatory initiative, the EPA has entered into consent decrees with several refiners, including Tesoro, that require the refiners to make significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment at selected facilities. However, we do not expect any additional requirements will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
On October 1, 2015, EPA strengthened the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion (“ppb”) from the 75 ppb level set in 2008. To implement the revised ozone NAAQS, all states will need to review their existing air quality management infrastructure State Implementation Plan for ozone and ensure it is appropriate and adequate. Where areas remain in ozone non-attainment, or come into ozone non-attainment as a result of the revised NAAQS it is likely that additional planning and control obligations will be required. States may impose additional emissions control requirements on stationary sources, changes in fuels specifications, and changes in fuels mix and mobile source emissions controls. The ongoing and potential future requirements imposed by states to meet the ozone NAAQS could have direct impacts on Tesoro facilities through additional requirements and increased permitting costs, and could have indirect impacts through changing or decreasing fuel demand.
The Energy Independence and Security Act was enacted into federal law in December 2007 creating a second Renewable Fuels Standard (“RFS2”) requiring the total volume of renewable transportation fuels (including ethanol and advanced biofuels) sold or introduced in the U.S. to reach 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. On December 14, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule establishing the Renewable Fuel Standard requirements for 2014 (16.28 billion gallons), 2015 (16.93 billion gallons) and 2016 (18.11 billion gallons). The ongoing and increasing requirements for renewable fuels in RFS2 could reduce future demand for petroleum products and thereby have an indirect effect on certain aspects of our business, although it could increase demand for our ethanol and biodiesel fuel blending services at our truck loading racks.
Currently, multiple legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation. These include actions to develop national, state or regional programs, each of which could require reductions in our greenhouse gas emissions or those of Tesoro and our other customers. On October 22, 2015, the EPA finalized amendments to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems source category (Subpart W) of the 



14 | Tesoro Logistics LP


BUSINESS

Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, including adding a new Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Gathering and Boosting segment, which will include greenhouse gas emissions from equipment and sources within the petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting systems. In September 2015, the EPA announced proposed new source performance standards for methane (a greenhouse gas) for new and modified oil and gas sector sources. These and other legislative regulatory measures will impose additional burdens on our business and those of Tesoro and our other customers.
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND WASTE REGULATIONS. To a large extent, the environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations relate to the release of hazardous substances or solid wastes into soils, groundwater, and surface water, and include measures to control pollution of the environment. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. They also require corrective action, including investigation and remediation, at a facility where such waste may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), and comparable state laws, impose liability, without regard to fault or to the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances found at the site.
Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. In the course of our ordinary operations, we generate waste that falls within CERCLA’s definition of a hazardous substance and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites. Costs for these remedial actions, if any, as well as any related claims are all covered by indemnities from Tesoro to the extent the release occurred or existed before the close of the Initial Offering and subsequent Acquisitions from Tesoro. Neither the Partnership nor Tesoro are currently engaged in any CERCLA related claims.
We also generate solid and liquid wastes, including hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes. From time to time, the EPA considers the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes, including wastes generated from the transportation and storage of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products. We are not currently required to 


comply with a substantial portion of the RCRA requirements because the majority of our facilities operate as small quantity generators of hazardous wastes by the EPA and state regulations. However, it is possible that additional wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during operations, will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes. Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non-hazardous wastes. On November 28, 2016, the EPA published the final Hazardous Waste Generator Improvements Rule. This rule provided some additional flexibility for small generators but also increased certain recordkeeping and administrative burdens. Any additional changes in the regulations could increase our capital or operating costs.
We acquired two salt water disposal wells located in North Dakota on January 1, 2017. These facilities are permitted under state regulations to accept produced water and fluids or waters from drilling and gas plant operations. These fluids are considered exempt from RCRA requirements per the Exploration & Production (“E&P”) exemption. Changes to state or federal regulations regarding the E&P exemption or rules for the operation of disposal wells could impose additional burdens on our business.
We currently own and lease properties where crude oil, refined petroleum hydrocarbons and fuel additives, such as methyl tertiary butyl ether and ethanol have been handled for many years by previous owners. At some facilities, hydrocarbons or other waste may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA, and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed or released wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including impacted groundwater), or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination to the extent we are not indemnified for such matters.
WATER POLLUTION REGULATIONS. Our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants, including chemical components of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products. Many of our facilities operate near environmentally sensitive waters, where tanker, pipeline and other petroleum product transportation operations are regulated by federal, state and local agencies and monitored by environmental interest groups. The transportation and storage of crude oil and refined products over and adjacent to water involves risk and subjects us to the provisions in some cases of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA 90”), and in all cases to related state requirements. These

BUSINESS

requirements can subject owners of covered facilities to strict, joint, and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and other consequences of an oil spill where the spill is into navigable waters, along shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. In the event of an oil spill into navigable waters, substantial liabilities could be imposed upon us. States in which we operate have also enacted similar, or in some cases, more stringent laws.
Regulations under the Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (the “Clean Water Act”), OPA 90 and state laws also impose additional regulatory burdens on our operations. Spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws and state laws require containment to mitigate or prevent contamination of waters in the event of a crude oil, natural gas, NGLs or refined products overflow, rupture, or leak from above-ground pipelines and storage tanks. The Clean Water Act requires us to maintain spill prevention control and countermeasure plans at our facilities with above-ground storage tanks and pipelines. In addition, OPA 90 requires that most oil transport and storage companies maintain and update various oil spill prevention and oil spill contingency plans. We maintain such plans, and where required have submitted plans and received federal and state approvals necessary to comply with OPA 90, the Clean Water Act and related regulations. Our crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined product spill prevention plans and procedures are frequently reviewed and modified to prevent crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined product releases and to minimize potential impacts should a release occur. At our facilities adjacent to water, federally certified Oil Spill Response Organizations (“OSROs”) are available to respond to a spill on water from above ground storage tanks or pipelines. We have contracts in place to ensure support from the respective OSROs for spills in both open and inland waters.
The OSROs are capable of responding to a spill on water equal to the greatest volume of the largest above ground storage tank at our facilities. Those volumes range from 5,000 barrels to 125,000 barrels. The OSROs have the highest available rating and certification from the United States Coast Guard (“USCG”) and are required to annually demonstrate their response capability to the USCG and state agencies. The OSROs rated and certified to respond to open water spills (which include those OSROs with which we contract at our marine terminals that have received the highest available rating and certification from the USCG) must demonstrate the capability to recover up to 50,000 barrels of oil per day and store up to 100,000 barrels of recovered oil at any given time. The OSROs rated and certified to respond to inland spills must demonstrate the capability to recover up to 7,500 barrels of oil per day and store up to 15,000 barrels of recovered oil at any given time.
At each of our facilities, we maintain spill-response capability to mitigate the impact of a spill from our facilities until either an OSRO or other contracted service providers can deploy, and Tesoro has entered into contracts with 


various parties to provide spill response services augmenting that capability, if required. Our spill response capability at our marine terminals meets the United States Coast Guard and state requirements to either deploy on-water containment equipment two times the length of a vessel at our dock or have smaller vessels available. Our spill response capabilities at our other facilities meet applicable federal and state requirements. In addition, we contract with various spill-response specialists to ensure appropriate expertise is available for such contingencies. We believe these contracts provide the additional services necessary to meet or exceed all regulatory spill-response requirements.
The Clean Water Act also imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. In certain locations, we contract with third parties for wastewater disposal. Our remaining facilities may have portions of their wastewater reclaimed by Tesoro’s nearby refineries. In the event regulatory requirements change, or interpretations of current requirements change, and our facilities are required to undertake different wastewater management arrangements, we could incur substantial additional costs. The Clean Water Act and RCRA can both impose substantial potential liability for the violation of permits or permitting requirements and for the costs of removal, remediation, and damages resulting from such discharges. In addition, states maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater.
TRIBAL LANDS. Various federal agencies, including the EPA and the Department of the Interior, along with certain Native American tribes, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to oil and gas operations on Native American tribal lands where we operate. These regulations include such matters as lease provisions, drilling and production requirements, and standards to protect environmental quality and cultural resources. For example, the EPA has established a preconstruction permitting program for new and modified minor sources throughout Indian country, and new and modified major sources in nonattainment areas in Indian country effective March 2016. In addition, each Native American tribe is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce laws and regulations and to grant approvals independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. These laws and regulations may increase our costs of doing business on Native American tribal lands and impact the viability of, or prevent or delay our ability to conduct, our natural gas gathering operations on such lands.
HYDRAULIC FRACTURING. We do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, but substantially all of our customers’ natural gas and crude oil production requires hydraulic fracturing as part of the completion process. Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and natural gas industry used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural-gas commissions, but the EPA and other federal agencies have 



16 | Tesoro Logistics LP


BUSINESS

asserted federal regulatory authority over the process. For example, the EPA has announced its intent to propose standards for wastewater discharge from oil and gas extraction activities, and in May 2014 issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking public comment on its plans to develop and issue regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. In addition, the U.S. Department of the Interior published a revised proposed rule on May 16, 2013 that would implement updated requirements for hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including new requirements relating to public disclosure, well bore integrity, and handling of flowback water.
If additional levels of regulation and permits are required through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal, state or local level that could lead to delays, increased operating costs and prohibitions for producers who drill near our pipelines, which could reduce the volumes of crude oil and natural gas available to move through our gathering systems and processing facilities, which could materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.


WORKING CAPITAL
We fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and equivalents and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, we have an available revolving line of credit and we may issue additional debt or equity securities for additional working capital or capital expenditures. See “Capital Resources and Liquidity” in Item 7 for additional information regarding working capital.
EMPLOYEES
All of the employees that conduct our business are employed by our general partner and its affiliates, and we believe that our general partner and its affiliates have a satisfactory relationship with those employees. TLGP had 1,088 employees performing services for our operations as of December 31, 2016, 204 of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire on February 1, 2019.
