Item 1. Description of Business
 
All references to "Notes" are to Notes to Financial Statements contained in this report.
 
On September 30, 2005, Arvida/JMB Partners, L.P. (the "Partnership") completed its liquidation by contributing all of its remaining assets to ALP Liquidating Trust ("ALP"), subject to all of the Partnership's obligations and liabilities. Arvida Company ("Arvida"), an affiliate of the former general partner of the Partnership, acts as Administrator (the "Administrator") of ALP.
 
In connection with its formation, ALP issued a total of 448,794 beneficial interest units to the partners of the Partnership ("Unit Holders"). In the liquidation, each partner in the Partnership received a beneficial interest in ALP for each interest the partner held in the Partnership. As a result, a partner's percentage interest in ALP remained the same as that person's percentage interest was in the Partnership immediately prior to its liquidation.
 
Upon completion of the liquidation of the Partnership, pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), ALP elected to become the successor issuer to the Partnership for reporting purposes under the Exchange Act and elected to report under the Exchange Act effective September 30, 2005. ALP has assumed all reports filed by the Partnership prior to liquidation of the Partnership under the Exchange Act. Throughout this report, references to ALP shall be deemed to include activities of the Partnership prior to September 30, 2005.
 
Until the ultimate completion of the liquidation, winding up and termination of ALP, it is currently anticipated that ALP will retain all or substantially all of its funds in reserve to provide for the payment of, the defense against, or other satisfaction or resolution of obligations, liabilities (including contingent liabilities) and current and possible future claims, and pending and possible future litigation. It is not possible at this time to estimate the amount of time or money that it will take to effect ALP's liquidation, winding up and termination. That portion, if any, of the funds held in reserve that are not ultimately used to pay, defend or otherwise resolve or satisfy obligations, liabilities or claims are currently anticipated to be distributed to the Unit Holders in ALP at a later date and may not be distributed until the completion of the liquidation. At such time that ALP considers its liquidation, winding up and termination to be imminent and its net realizable assets to be reasonably determinable, it expects to adopt the liquidation basis of accounting.
 
Various factors may affect the timing of completing the liquidation, winding up and termination of ALP and the amount of liquidating distributions of funds, if any, out of those retained in reserve. These factors include the time and expense to resolve all obligations, liabilities and claims, including contingent liabilities and claims that are not yet asserted but may be made in the future. Among other things, delays in resolving pending or threatened litigation or other asserted claims, currently unasserted claims that arise in the future and other factors could result in a reduction in future distributions to Unit Holders in ALP and could extend the time, and significantly increase the cost, to complete the liquidation, winding up and termination of ALP. While ALP intends to defend against asserted claims where appropriate, it is currently not possible to identify or assess any defenses or counterclaims that may be available to ALP, or the magnitude of any claims that may be asserted.

The current registrant, ALP Liquidating Trust was originally a limited partnership formed in 1987 and governed under the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act of the State of Delaware. The Partnership was formed to own and develop substantially all of the assets of Arvida Corporation (the "Seller"), a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, which were acquired by the Partnership from the Seller on September 10, 1987. On September 16, 1987, the Partnership commenced an offering to the public of up to $400,000,000 in Limited Partnership Interests and assignee interests therein ("Interests") pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 under the Securities Act of 1933 (No. 33-14091). A total of 400,000 Interests were sold to the public (at an offering price of $1,000 per Interest before discounts) and the holders of 400,000 Interests were admitted to the Partnership in October 1987. The offering terminated October 31, 1987. In addition, a holder (an affiliate of the dealer-manager of the public offering) of 4,000 Interests was admitted to the Partnership in October 1987. Subsequent to admittance to the Partnership, no Holder of Interests (a "Holder" or "Holder of Interests") has made any additional capital contribution. The Holders of Interests of the Partnership generally share in their portion of the benefits of ownership of the Partnership's real property investments and other assets according to the number of Interests held.
 
Pursuant to Section 5.5J of the Partnership's Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership (the "Partnership Agreement"), on October 23, 1997, the Board of Directors of the General Partner met and approved a resolution selecting the option set forth in Section 5.5J(i)(c) of the Partnership Agreement for the Partnership to commence an orderly liquidation of its remaining assets that was to be completed by October 2002. In October 2002, the Partnership commenced a solicitation for consents to an amendment (the "Amendment") to the Partnership Agreement providing for an extension of the term of the Partnership's liquidation period to not later than October 31, 2005. In addition, under the terms of the Amendment, Arvida/JMB Managers, Inc., the General Partner of the Partnership, was authorized, in its sole discretion, to complete the liquidation of the Partnership by forming ALP and contributing any remaining Partnership assets to ALP subject to all outstanding obligations and liabilities of the Partnership. In November 2002, the Holders of a majority of the outstanding Interests gave their consent to the Amendment, which became effective October 29, 2002.
 
As noted above, under the terms of the Amendment, the General Partner was authorized, in its sole discretion, to complete the liquidation of the Partnership by forming a Liquidating Trust. The trustee or trustees of ALP could be an officer or officers of the General Partner or an affiliate of the General Partner. The remaining Partnership assets would be contributed to ALP subject to all outstanding obligations and liabilities of the Partnership. The General Partner, Associate Limited Partners and Holders of Interests would receive beneficial interests in ALP in proportion to their respective interests in the Partnership. Subsequently, after liquidating any remaining non-cash assets and providing for the payment or satisfaction of all such obligations and liabilities, the trustee(s) of ALP would distribute any remaining proceeds to Arvida, Associate Limited Partners and Holders of Interests in proportion to their respective interests in ALP.
 
Prior to the commencement of the Partnership's orderly liquidation, the assets of the Partnership consisted principally of interests in land developed into master-planned residential communities (the "Communities"), and, to a lesser extent, commercial properties; accounts receivable; construction, brokerage and other support businesses; real estate assets held for investment and certain club and recreational facilities. The Partnership was principally engaged in the development of comprehensively planned resort and primary home Communities containing a diversified product mix designed for the middle and upper income segments of the various markets in which the Partnership operated. The Communities were located primarily throughout the State of Florida, with Communities also located near Atlanta, Georgia and Highlands, North Carolina. In addition, the Partnership, directly or through certain subsidiaries, provided development and management services to the homeowners associations within the Communities.

Pursuant to a management agreement with the Partnership, through December 31, 1997, Arvida provided development and management supervisory and advisory services and the personnel therefore to the Partnership for all of its projects and operations, subject, in each case, to the overall control of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership. Arvida entered into a sub-management agreement with St. Joe/Arvida Company, LP (now known as St. Joe Towns & Resorts, LP - "Towns & Resorts LP"), effective January 1, 1998, whereby Towns & Resorts LP provided (and was reimbursed for) a substantial portion of the development and management supervisory and advisory services (and personnel with respect thereto) to the Partnership that Arvida would have otherwise provided pursuant to its management agreement with the Partnership. Affiliates of JMB Realty Corporation owned a minority interest in Towns & Resorts LP until July 2003, when they sold their minority interest to an affiliate of the St. Joe Company. Such sale did not involve the sale of any assets of the Partnership, the sale of the General Partner's interest in the Partnership, nor a change in the submanagement agreement for the services provided to the Partnership by Towns & Resorts LP. The St. Joe Company beneficially owns 23.9% of the outstanding beneficial interest units of ALP as of March 30, 2017.
 
In late 2007, it was determined that certain remnant parcels from past developments were still owned by ALP rather than by relevant homeowners associations or public entities. These remnant parcels generally have no value and, to the extent hereafter deeded to third parties, will result in no material proceeds to the Trust. ALP is working with relevant parties on some of these parcels to affect the transfer of these parcels where feasible. However, certain of these parcels carry past-due taxes that include years where they had been assessed on pre-subdivision values that, due to the passage of time and the expiration of local appeals periods, precluded their being deeded over in the normal course. These taxes are non-recourse to ALP. While these parcels are being handled on a case-by-case basis, where ALP is unable to effect a transfer whereby any material accrued taxes are waived by the taxing authority or assumed by the transferee, ALP generally will allow such parcels to be acquired by third parties at tax sale in order to relieve ALP from any future liabilities associated with them. ALP continues to work to transfer or otherwise dispose of the remaining parcels. The cost of completing this process is not expected to be material, however ALP is unable to predict the time period required.
 
ALP has no employees.
 
ALP currently owns select licenses and trademarks that relate to Sawgrass. Towns & Resorts LP owns the Arvida name and service marks with respect to the Arvida name. ALP has a license agreement with Towns & Resorts LP to use the Arvida name.
 
The terms of transactions between ALP and the successor Administrator and its affiliates are set forth in Items 10 and 12 filed with this annual report to which reference is hereby made for a description of such terms and transactions.
