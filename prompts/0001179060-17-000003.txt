     Item 1. Business
     General
     EnLink Midstream Partners, LP is a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership formed in 2002. Our common units are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “ENLK.” Our business activities are conducted through our subsidiary, EnLink Midstream Operating, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”), and the subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. Our executive offices are located at 2501 Cedar Springs Rd., Dallas, Texas 75201, and our telephone number is (214) 953-9500. Our Internet address is www.enlink.com. We post the following filings in the “Investors” section of our website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission: our annual reports on Form 10-K; our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q; our current reports on Form 8-K; and any amendments to those reports or statements filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All such filings on our website are available free of charge. In this report, the terms “Partnership” and “Registrant,” as well as the terms “our,” “we,” “us” and “its,” are sometimes used as abbreviated references to EnLink Midstream Partners, LP itself or EnLink Midstream Partners, LP together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership.
     EnLink Midstream GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, is our general partner. Our general partner manages our operations and activities. Our general partner is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of EnLink Midstream, LLC (“ENLC” or “EnLink Midstream”). ENLC’s units are traded on the NYSE under the symbol “ENLC.” ENLC’s manager is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Devon Energy Corporation (“Devon”).
     Effective as of March 7, 2014, the Operating Partnership acquired (the “Acquisition”) 50% of the outstanding equity interests in EnLink Midstream Holdings, LP (“Midstream Holdings”) and all of the outstanding equity interests in EnLink Midstream Holdings GP, LLC, the general partner of Midstream Holdings, in exchange for the issuance by us of 120,542,441 units representing a new class of limited partnership interests in our partnership. At the same time, EnLink Midstream, Inc. (“EMI”), the entity that directly owns our general partner, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ENLC (together with the Acquisition, the “Business Combination”). At the conclusion of the Business Combination, another wholly-owned subsidiary of ENLC, Acacia Natural Gas Corp. I, Inc. (“Acacia”), owned the remaining 50% of the outstanding equity interests in Midstream Holdings. On February 17, 2015, Acacia contributed a 25% interest in Midstream Holdings (the “February 2015 Transferred Interests”) to us in exchange for 31.6 million units in our partnership (the “February 2015 EMH Drop Down”). On May 27, 2015, we acquired the remaining 25% limited partner interest in Midstream Holdings (the “May 2015 Transferred Interests” and, together with the February 2015 Transferred Interests, the “2015 Transferred Interests”) from Acacia in a drop-down transaction in exchange for 36.6 million units in our partnership (the “May 2015 EMH Drop Down” and, together with the February 2015 EMH Drop Down, the “EMH Drop Downs”). After giving effect to the EMH Drop Downs, we own 100% of Midstream Holdings.
     Midstream Holdings was formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of Devon, and it gathers, processes and transports natural gas, primarily for Devon. Midstream Holdings also fractionates natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) into component NGL products. Under the acquisition method of accounting, Midstream Holdings is considered the historical predecessor of our business because Devon obtained control of us through its control of ENLC and through the indirect acquisition of our general partner.
     On January 7, 2016, EnLink Oklahoma Gas Processing, LP (“EnLink Oklahoma T.O.”), an indirect subsidiary of our partnership, completed its acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of TOMPC LLC and TOM-STACK, LLC. EnLink Oklahoma T.O. is sometimes used herein to refer to EnLink Oklahoma Gas Processing, LP itself or EnLink Oklahoma Gas Processing, LP, together with its consolidated subsidiaries. As of February 12, 2016, (a) the Operating Partnership, owns an 84% limited partnership interest in EnLink Oklahoma T.O.; (b) EMI owns a 16% limited partnership interest in EnLink Oklahoma T.O. and (c) EnLink Energy GP, LLC, the general partner of EnLink Oklahoma T.O. and an indirect subsidiary of our partnership, owns the non-economic general partnership interest.
     On August 1, 2016, we formed a joint venture (the “Delaware Basin JV”) with an affiliate of NGP Natural Resources XI, L.P. (“NGP”) to operate and expand our natural gas, NGLs and crude oil midstream assets in the liquids-

 
  3

 
rich Delaware Basin. The Delaware Basin JV is owned 50.1% by us and 49.9% by NGP. Since we control the Delaware Basin JV, we reflect our ownership in the Delaware Basin JV on a consolidated basis, and NGP’s ownership is reflected as a non-controlling interest in the respective consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
     The following diagram depicts our organization and ownership as of December 31, 2016: 
    
 Definitions
     The following terms as defined generally are used in the energy industry and in this document:
     /d = per day
 Bbls = barrels
 Bcf = billion cubic feet
 Boe = six Mcf of gas per Bbl of oil
 Btu = British thermal units
 CO2= Carbon dioxide
 CPI= Consumer Price Index
 Gal = gallon
 HP = horsepower
 Mcf = thousand cubic feet
 MMBtu = million British thermal units
 MMcf = million cubic feet
 NGL = natural gas liquid and natural gas liquids
    
 
  4

 

 Capacity volumes for our facilities are measured based on physical volume and stated in cubic feet (“Bcf”, “Mcf” or “MMcf”). Throughput volumes are measured based on energy content and stated in British thermal units (“Btu” or “MMBtu”). A volume capacity of 100 MMcf generally correlates to volume capacity of 100,000 MMBtu. Fractionated volumes are measured based on physical volumes and stated in gallons. Crude oil, condensate and brine services volumes are measured based on physical volume and stated in barrels (“Bbls”).
     We define ”gross operating margin,” a non-GAAP financial measure, as revenues less cost of sales. We disclose gross operating margin in addition to total revenue because it is the primary performance measure used by our management. We believe gross operating margin is an important measure because, in general, our business is to purchase and resell natural gas, NGLs, condensate and crude oil for a margin or to gather, process, transport or market natural gas, NGLs, condensate and crude oil for a fee. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to gross operating margin is operating income (loss). For more information on gross operating margin, including its limitations as a financial measure, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
     Our Operations
     We are a Delaware limited partnership formed on July 12, 2002. We primarily focus on providing midstream energy services, including gathering, transmission, processing, fractionation, storage, condensate stabilization, brine services and marketing, to producers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate. Our midstream energy asset network includes approximately 11,000 miles of pipelines, 20 natural gas processing plants, 7 fractionators, barge and rail terminals, product storage facilities, purchasing and marketing capabilities, brine disposal wells, a crude oil trucking fleet, and equity investments in certain private midstream companies. Our operations are based in the United States and our sales are derived primarily from external domestic customers.
     We connect the wells of natural gas producers in our market areas to our gathering systems, process natural gas for the removal of NGLs, fractionate NGLs into purity products and market those products for a fee, transport natural gas and ultimately provide natural gas to a variety of markets. We purchase natural gas from natural gas producers and other supply sources and sell that natural gas to utilities, industrial consumers, other marketers and pipelines. We operate processing plants that process gas transported to the plants by major interstate pipelines or from our own gathering systems under a variety of fee-based arrangements. We provide a variety of crude oil and condensate services, which include crude oil and condensate gathering via pipelines, barges, rail and trucks, condensate stabilization and brine disposal. Our gas gathering systems consist of networks of pipelines that collect natural gas from points near producing wells and transport it to larger pipelines for further transmission. Our transmission pipelines primarily receive natural gas from our gathering systems and from third party gathering and transmission systems and deliver natural gas to industrial end-users, utilities and other pipelines. We also have transmission lines that transport NGLs from east Texas and from our south Louisiana processing plants to our fractionators in south Louisiana. Additionally, we own an economic interest in an NGL fractionator located at Mont Belvieu, Texas that receives raw mix NGLs from customers, fractionates such raw mix and redelivers the finished products to the customers for a fee. Devon is one of the largest customers of this fractionator. Our crude oil and condensate gathering and transmission systems consist of trucking facilities, pipelines, rail and barge facilities that, in exchange for a fee, transport oil from a producer site to end users or other pipelines. Our processing plants remove NGLs and CO2 from a natural gas stream and our fractionators separate the NGLs into separate NGL products, including ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane and natural gasoline.
     Our assets are included in five primary segments:
    
· | Texas. Our Texas assets consist of transmission pipelines with a capacity of approximately 920 MMcf/d, processing facilities with a total processing capacity of approximately 1.6 Bcf/d and gathering systems with total capacity of approximately 2.3 Bcf/d.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Oklahoma. Our Oklahoma assets consist of processing facilities with a total processing capacity of approximately 795 MMcf/d and gathering systems with total capacity of approximately 810 MMcf/d.

The assets also include 900,000 barrels of above ground storage and a trucking fleet of approximately 150 vehicles comprised of both semi and straight trucks with a current capacity of 85,350 Bbls/d. The current pipeline capacity is 116,100 Bbls/d. Additionally, our operations include eight condensate stabilization and natural gas compression stations with combined capacities of over 36,000 Bbls/d of condensate stabilization and 780 MMcf/d of natural gas compression.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Corporate. Our Corporate assets consist of a contractual right to the benefits and burdens associated with Devon’s 38.75% ownership interest in Gulf Coast Fractionators (“GCF”), our approximate 31% ownership interest in Howard Energy Partners (“HEP”) and our approximate 30% ownership in Cedar Cove Midstream LLC (“Cedar Cove JV”).

     Devon (NYSE: DVN) is a leading independent energy company engaged primarily in the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. Devon’s operations are concentrated in various onshore areas in the U.S. and Canada. Please see Devon’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the “Devon Annual Report”) for additional information concerning Devon’s business. The information contained in the Devon Annual Report is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the SEC. Our Business Strategies
     Our primary business objective is to provide cash flow stability in our business while growing prudently and profitably. We intend to accomplish this objective by executing the following strategies:
· | Maintain stable cash flows supported by long-term, fee-based contracts. We will seek to generate cash flows pursuant to long-term, firm contracts with creditworthy customers. We will continue to pursue opportunities to increase the fee-based and minimum volume commitment (“MVC”) components of our contract portfolio to minimize our direct commodity price exposure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maintain a strong financial position. We believe that maintaining a conservative and balanced capital structure, appropriate leverage and other key financial metrics will afford us better access to the capital markets at a competitive cost of capital. We also believe a strong financial position provides us the opportunity to grow our business in a prudent manner throughout the cycles in our industry.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Execute in our core growth areas. We believe our assets are positioned in some of the most economic basins in the U.S., as well as key demand centers with growing end-use customers. We expect to grow certain of our systems organically over time by meeting our customers’ midstream service needs that result from their drilling activity in our areas of operation. We continually evaluate whether to pursue economically attractive organic expansion opportunities in existing or new areas of operation that allow us to leverage our existing infrastructure, operating expertise and customer relationships by constructing and expanding systems to meet new or increased demand for our services.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Our Competitive Strengths
     We believe that we are well-positioned to execute our strategies and to achieve our primary business objective due to the following competitive strengths:
    
· | Devon’s sponsorship. We expect our relationship with Devon will continue to provide us with significant business opportunities. Devon is one of the largest independent oil and gas producers in North America. Devon has a significant interest in promoting the success of our business, due to its 64.1% ownership interest in ENLC and 23.8% ownership interest in us as of December 31, 2016. Approximately 50% of our gross operating margin was attributable to commercial contracts with Devon in 2016.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Strategically-located assets. The majority of our assets are strategically located in producing regions with the potential for increasing throughput volume and cash flow generation. Our asset portfolio includes gathering, transmission, fractionation, and processing systems that are located in the areas in which producer activity is focused on crude oil, condensate and NGLs, as well as natural gas. We have established platforms in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Ohio, and are focused on growing our operations in central Oklahoma, the Permian Basin and southern Louisiana through organic development and acquisitions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Stable cash flows. Approximately 97% of our cash flows were generated from fee-based services with no direct commodity exposure during 2016. We have approximately seven years remaining on fixed-fee gathering and processing agreements with a subsidiary of Devon pursuant to which we provide gathering, treating, compression, dehydration, stabilization, processing and fractionation services, as applicable, for natural gas delivered by Devon to our gathering and processing systems in the Barnett and Cana-Woodford Shales. These agreements provide us with dedication of all of the natural gas owned or controlled by Devon and produced from or attributable to existing and future wells located on certain oil, natural gas and mineral leases covering lands within the acreage dedications, excluding properties previously dedicated to other natural gas gathering systems not owned and operated by Devon. These agreements also include MVCs that will remain in effect through January 1, 2019, as well as annual rate escalators. Additionally, our recently acquired EnLink Oklahoma T.O. assets are supported by Devon with acreage dedications and MVCs for gathering and processing on Devon’s Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties (“STACK”) acreage. For additional information, please read “Our Contractual Relationship with Devon.” We will continue to focus on contract structures that reduce volatility and support long-term stability of cash flows.

      Organic Growth
     Greater Chickadee Crude Oil Gathering System. We have a new crude oil gathering system in Upton and Midland counties, Texas in the Permian Basin that we refer to as “Greater Chickadee.” Greater Chickadee includes approximately 185 miles of high- and low-pressure pipelines that will transport crude oil volumes to several major market outlets and other key hub centers in the Midland, Texas area. Greater Chickadee also includes the construction of 50,000 Bbls of crude oil storage and a truck injection station to maximize shipping and delivery options for our producer customers. The initial phase of our Greater Chickadee transportation service began in November 2016. Additional construction is ongoing, and we expect full service capabilities in the first quarter of 2017.
     Cedar Cove Joint Venture. On November 9, 2016, we formed the Cedar Cove JV with Kinder Morgan, Inc., consisting of gathering and compression assets in Blaine County, Oklahoma, located in the heart of the STACK play. The gathering system has a capacity of 25 MMcf/d with over 50,000 gross acres of dedications and ties into our existing Oklahoma assets. All gas gathered by the Cedar Cove JV will be processed at our central Oklahoma processing system (as defined below). We  committed to contribute $39.0 million in cash in exchange for 30% ownership of the Cedar Cove JV, and as of December 31, 2016, we have contributed $28.8 million. Thereafter, we and Kinder Morgan, Inc. will contribute additional capital in proportion to our respective ownership interests to fund operations. 
     Delaware Basin Joint Venture. On August 1, 2016, we formed the Delaware Basin JV with NGP to operate and expand our natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil midstream assets in the liquids-rich Delaware Basin. The Delaware Basin JV is owned 50.1% by us and 49.9% by NGP. We contributed approximately $221.0 million of existing assets, net of depreciation,   Basin JV and committed an additional $285.0 million in capital to fund potential future development projects and potential acquisitions. NGP committed an aggregate of approximately $400.0 million of capital, including an initial contribution of $114.3 million, which the Delaware Basin JV distributed to us at the formation of the joint venture to reimburse us for capital spent to the date of formation on existing assets and ongoing projects. In addition to the initial contributions, we and NGP contributed $30.2 million and $30.1 million, respectively, to the Delaware Basin JV for the year ended December 31, 2016. As part of this agreement, NGP granted us call rights beginning in 2021 to acquire increasing portions of NGP’s interest in the joint venture at a price based upon a predetermined valuation methodology.
     Lobo II Natural Gas Gathering and Processing Facility. In October 2016, we completed construction of a new cryogenic gas processing plant located in the Delaware Basin (our “Lobo II plant”) with initial capacity of 60 MMcf/d. The Lobo II expansion also included the construction of a 75-mile gathering system located in Texas and New Mexico. Construction on the Texas portion of the gathering system was completed in October 2016, and the remaining New Mexico pipeline was completed in the first quarter of 2017. The Lobo II facilities are part of the Delaware Basin JV.
     Riptide Processing Plant. In April 2016, we completed construction of the Riptide processing plant in the Permian Basin. The plant provides 100 MMcf/d of processing capacity and is tied to approximately 50 miles of new gathering pipeline, all of which is connected to our MEGA system (as defined below). 
     Ascension Joint Venture. We have formed a 50/50 joint venture named Ascension Pipeline Company, LLC (the “Ascension JV”) with a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corporation (“Marathon Petroleum”) to build a new 30-mile NGL pipeline connecting our existing Riverside fractionation and terminal complex to Marathon Petroleum’s Garyville refinery located on the Mississippi River. We commenced construction of the pipeline during 2016 and will operate the

pipeline upon completion, which is currently estimated to be during the second quarter of 2017. This bolt-on project to our Cajun-Sibon NGL system is supported by long-term, fee-based contracts with Marathon Petroleum.
     Sale of Non-Core Assets
     In December 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our ownership interest in HEP for approximately $193.1 million, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. We expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an impairment loss of $20.1 million to reduce the carrying value of our investment to the expected sales price.
     In December 2016, we sold the North Texas Pipeline (the “NTPL”), a 140-mile natural gas transportation pipeline, for $84.6 million.  We maintain capacity on the NTPL at competitive rates and at levels sufficient to support current and expected operations. We recorded a loss related to the sale of $13.4 million.
     Acquisitions in 2014 and 2015:
    
· | On November 1, 2014, we acquired, from affiliates of Chevron Corporation, Gulf Coast natural gas pipeline assets predominantly located in southern Louisiana, together with 100% of the voting interests in certain entities, for approximately $231.5 million.

      Additionally we have a new crude oil gathering system in Upton and Midland counties, Texas in the Permian Basin that we refer to as “Greater Chickadee.” Greater Chickadee includes approximately 185 miles of high- and low-pressure pipelines that will transport crude oil volumes to several major market outlets and other key hub centers in the Midland, Texas area. Greater Chickadee also includes the construction of multiple central tank batteries and pump, truck injection, and storage stations to maximize shipping and delivery options for our producer customers. The initial phase of our Greater Chickadee transportation service began in November 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, throughput volumes averaged 1,000 Bbls/d. For the period of commencement of service to December 31, 2016, throughput volumes averaged 6,200 Bbls/d. Additional construction is ongoing, and we expect the gathering system to reach full service in the first quarter of 2017.
    
· | Victoria Express Pipeline. The VEX pipeline is a 60-mile, multi-grade crude oil pipeline with a current capacity of approximately 90,000 Bbls/d. Other VEX assets include the Cuero Terminal and Port of Victoria Terminal and Barge Docks. The Cuero truck unloading terminal at the origin of the VEX system contains 8 unloading bays and 200,000 bbls of above-ground storage capacity for receipt from and delivery to the VEX pipeline. The VEX pipeline terminates at the Port of Victoria Terminal that also has an 8-bay truck unloading dock and 200,000 bbls of above-ground storage capacity. The Port of Victoria Terminal delivers to two barge loading docks at the Port of Victoria. Total crude oil and condensate handled averaged approximately 14,500 Bbls/d for the year ended December 31, 2016. We have an agreement with Devon, which includes an MVC of 30,000 Bbls/d, that will remain in effect until July 2019.

      Industry Overview
     The following diagram illustrates the gathering, processing, fractionation, stabilization and transmission process.
             The midstream industry is the link between the exploration and production of natural gas and crude oil and condensate and the delivery of its components to end-user markets. The midstream industry is generally characterized by regional competition based on the proximity of gathering systems and processing plants to natural gas and crude oil and condensate producing wells.
    
 
  18

 

 Natural gas gathering. The natural gas gathering process follows the drilling of wells into gas-bearing rock formations. After a well has been completed, it is connected to a gathering system. Gathering systems typically consist of a network of small diameter pipelines and, if necessary, compression and treating systems that collect natural gas from points near producing wells and transport it to larger pipelines for further transmission.
     Compression. Gathering systems are operated at pressures that will maximize the total natural gas throughput from all connected wells. Because wells produce gas at progressively lower field pressures as they age, it becomes increasingly difficult to deliver the remaining production in the ground against the higher pressure that exists in the connected gathering system. Natural gas compression is a mechanical process in which a volume of gas at an existing pressure is compressed to a desired higher pressure, allowing gas that no longer naturally flows into a higher-pressure downstream pipeline to be brought to market. Field compression is typically used to allow a gathering system to operate at a lower pressure or provide sufficient discharge pressure to deliver gas into a higher-pressure downstream pipeline. The remaining natural gas in the ground will not be produced if field compression is not installed because the gas will be unable to overcome the higher gathering system pressure. A declining well can continue delivering natural gas if field compression is installed.
     Natural gas processing. The principal components of natural gas are methane and ethane, but most natural gas also contains varying amounts of heavier NGLs and contaminants, such as water and CO2, sulfur compounds, nitrogen or helium. Natural gas produced by a well may not be suitable for long-haul pipeline transportation or commercial use and may need to be processed to remove the heavier hydrocarbon components and contaminants. Natural gas in commercial distribution systems mostly consists of methane and ethane, and moisture and other contaminants have been removed so there are negligible amounts of them in the gas stream. Natural gas is processed to remove unwanted contaminants that would interfere with pipeline transportation or use of the natural gas and to separate those hydrocarbon liquids from the gas that have higher value as NGLs. The removal and separation of individual hydrocarbons through processing is possible due to differences in weight, boiling point, vapor pressure and other physical characteristics. Natural gas processing involves the separation of natural gas into pipeline-quality natural gas and a mixed NGL stream and the removal of contaminants.
     NGL fractionation. NGLs are separated into individual, more valuable components during the fractionation process. NGL fractionation facilities separate mixed NGL streams into discrete NGL products: ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane, natural gasoline and stabilized crude oil and condensate. Ethane is primarily used in the petrochemical industry as feedstock for ethylene, one of the basic building blocks for a wide range of plastics and other chemical products. Propane is used as a petrochemical feedstock in the production of ethylene and propylene and as a heating fuel, an engine fuel and industrial fuel. Isobutane is used principally to enhance the octane content of motor gasoline. Normal butane is used as a petrochemical feedstock in the production of ethylene and butylene (a key ingredient in synthetic rubber), as a blend stock for motor gasoline and to derive isobutene through isomerization. Natural gasoline, a mixture of pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons, is used primarily as motor gasoline blend stock or petrochemical feedstock.
     Natural gas transmission. Natural gas transmission pipelines receive natural gas from mainline transmission pipelines, processing plants and gathering systems and deliver it to industrial end-users, utilities and to other pipelines.
     Crude oil and condensate transmission. Crude oil and condensate are transported by pipelines, barges, rail cars and tank trucks. The method of transportation used depends on, among other things, the resources of the transporter, the locations of the production points and the delivery points, cost-efficiency and the quantity of product being transported.
     Condensate Stabilization. Condensate stabilization is the distillation of the condensate product to remove the lighter end components, which ultimately creates a higher quality condensate product that is then delivered via truck, rail or pipeline to local markets.
     Brine gathering and disposal services. Typically, shale wells produce significant amounts of water that, in most cases, require disposal. Produced water and frac-flowback is hauled via truck transport or is pumped through pipelines from its origin at the oilfield tank battery or drilling pad to the disposal location. Once the water reaches the delivery disposal location, water is processed and filtered to remove impurities and injection wells place fluids underground for storage and disposal.
     Crude oil and condensate terminals. Crude oil and condensate rail terminals are an integral part of ensuring the movement of new crude oil and condensate production from the developing shale plays in the United States and Canada. 

 
  19

 
In general, the crude oil and condensate rail loading terminals are used to load rail cars and transport the commodity out of developing basins into market rich areas of the country where crude oil and condensate rail unloading terminals are used to unload rail cars and store crude oil and condensate volumes for third parties until the crude oil and condensate is redelivered to premium market delivery points via pipelines, trucks or rail.
     Balancing Supply and Demand
     When we purchase natural gas, crude oil and condensate, we establish a margin normally by selling it for physical delivery to third-party users. We can also use over-the-counter derivative instruments or enter into future delivery obligations under futures contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) related to our natural gas purchases. Through these transactions, we seek to maintain a position that is balanced between (1) purchases and (2) sales or future delivery obligations. Our policy is not to acquire and hold natural gas futures contracts or derivative products for the purpose of speculating on price changes.     Competition
     The business of providing gathering, transmission, processing and marketing services for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate is highly competitive. We face strong competition in obtaining natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate supplies and in the marketing and transportation of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate. Our competitors include major integrated and independent exploration and production companies, natural gas producers, interstate and intrastate pipelines, other natural gas, NGLs and crude oil and condensate gatherers and natural gas processors. Competition for natural gas and crude oil and condensate supplies is primarily based on geographic location of facilities in relation to production or markets, the reputation, efficiency and reliability of the gatherer and the pricing arrangements offered by the gatherer. As a result of certain of our contractual relationships with Devon, we will not compete for the portion of Devon’s existing operations subject to existing acreage dedication for the terms of such contracts. For areas where acreage is not dedicated to us, we will compete with similar enterprises in providing additional gathering and processing services in its respective areas of operation, which may offer more services or have strong financial resources and access to larger natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate supplies than we do. Our competition varies in different geographic areas.
     In marketing natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate, we have numerous competitors, including marketing affiliates of interstate pipelines, major integrated oil and gas companies, and local and national natural gas producers, gatherers, brokers and marketers of widely varying sizes, financial resources and experience. Local utilities and distributors of natural gas are, in some cases, engaged directly and through affiliates in marketing activities that compete with our marketing operations.
     We face strong competition for acquisitions and development of new projects from both established and start-up companies. Competition increases the cost to acquire existing facilities or businesses and results in fewer commitments and lower returns for new pipelines or other development projects. Our competitors may have greater financial resources than we possess or may be willing to accept lower returns or greater risks. Our competition differs by region and by the nature of the business or the project involved.
     Natural Gas, NGL, Crude Oil and Condensate Supply
     Our gathering and transmission pipelines have connections with major intrastate and interstate pipelines, which we believe have ample natural gas and NGL supplies in excess of the volumes required for the operation of these systems. We evaluate well and reservoir data that is either publicly available or furnished by producers or other service providers in connection with the construction and acquisition of our gathering systems and assets to determine the availability of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate supply for our systems and assets and/or obtain an MVC from the producer that results in a rate of return on investment. We do not routinely obtain independent evaluations of reserves dedicated to our systems and assets due to the cost and relatively limited benefit of such evaluations. Accordingly, we do not have estimates of total reserves dedicated to our systems and assets or the anticipated life of such producing reserves.     Credit Risk and Significant Customers
     We are subject to risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers and other counterparties, such as our lenders and hedging counterparties. We diligently attempt to ensure that we issue credit to 

 
  20

 
only credit-worthy customers. However, our purchase and resale of crude oil, condensate, NGLs and natural gas exposes us to significant credit risk, as the margin on any sale is generally a very small percentage of the total sales price. Therefore, a credit loss can be very large relative to our overall profitability. Some of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection, and their debts and payments to us are subject to laws governing bankruptcy. Moreover, the combination of a reduction of cash flow resulting from lower commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in our customers’ liquidity and ability to make payment or perform on their obligations to us. Furthermore, some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to us. A substantial portion of our throughput volumes come from producers that have investment-grade ratings; however, many of our customers’ equity values have substantially declined and some of these customers, including Devon, have had their credit ratings downgraded by major credit ratings agencies.
     For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Devon represented 18.5%, 16.6% and 30.6%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues and Dow Hydrocarbons & Resources LLC (“Dow Hydrocarbons”) represented 10.8%, 11.7% and 11.0%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. No other customer represented greater than 10.0% of our revenue. Our operations are dependent on the volume of natural gas that Devon provides to us under commercial agreements, which constitutes a substantial portion of our natural gas supply. The loss of Devon or Dow Hydrocarbons as a customer could have a material impact on our results of operations if we were not able to sell our products to another customer with similar margins because the gross operating margins received from transactions with Devon and Dow Hydrocarbons are material to our total gross operating margin.
     Regulation
     Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Regulation. We own interstate natural gas pipelines that are subject to regulation as natural gas companies by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”). These assets include our Acacia transmission system and our Louisiana gas pipeline system.  FERC regulates the rates and terms and conditions of service on interstate natural gas pipelines, as well as the certification, construction, extension and abandonment of facilities.
     The rates and terms and conditions for our interstate pipeline services must be just and reasonable and not unduly preferential or unduly discriminatory, although negotiated or settlement rates may be accepted in certain circumstances.  Such rates and terms and conditions are set forth in FERC-approved tariffs.  FERC must approve proposed rate increases and changes to our tariffs.  Pursuant to FERC’s jurisdiction over rates, existing rates may be challenged by complaint or by FERC on its own initiative, and proposed rate increases may be challenged by protest.  If protested, a rate increase may be suspended for up to five months and collected, subject to refund. If, upon completion of an investigation, FERC finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful, it is authorized to require the pipeline to refund revenues collected in excess of the just and reasonable rate during the term of the investigation.  
     The rates charged by our natural gas pipelines may also be affected by the ongoing uncertainty regarding FERC’s current income tax allowance policy. In July 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued its opinion in United Airlines, Inc., et al.v. FERC, finding that FERC had acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it failed to demonstrate that permitting an interstate petroleum products pipeline organized as a limited partnership to include an income tax allowance in the cost of service underlying its rates in addition to the discounted cash flow return on equity would not result in the pipeline double-recovering its investors’ income taxes. The court vacated FERC’s order and remanded to FERC to consider mechanisms for demonstrating that there is no double recovery as a result of the income tax allowance. On December 15, 2016, FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking comment on how to address any double recovery resulting from its income tax allowance policy. FERC is currently considering whether, and if so, to what extent, pipelines owned by pass-through entities such as MLPs may include income tax allowance in rates to compensate for the income tax liability of investors.
     Interstate natural gas pipelines regulated by FERC are required to comply with numerous regulations related to standards of conduct, market transparency, and market manipulation. FERC’s standards of conduct regulate the manner in which interstate natural gas pipelines may interact with their marketing affiliates. FERC’s market oversight and transparency regulations require regulated entities to submit annual reports of threshold purchases or sales of natural gas and publicly post certain information on scheduled volumes. FERC’s market manipulation regulations, promulgated pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EPAct 2005”), make it unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of 

 
  21

 
transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, to (1) use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The EPAct 2005 also amends the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”) to give FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes up to $1.0 million per day per violation for violations occurring after August 8, 2005. The maximum penalty authority established by the statute has been and will continue to be adjusted periodically for inflation. Should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.
     Our intrastate natural gas pipelines also transport gas in interstate commerce and, thus, the rates, terms and conditions of such services are subject to FERC jurisdiction under Section 311 of the NGPA (“Section 311”). Pipelines providing transportation service under Section 311 are required to provide services on an open and nondiscriminatory basis and the maximum rates for intrastate transportation services must be “fair and equitable.” Such rates are generally subject to review every five years by FERC or by an appropriate state agency. 
     Interstate Liquids Pipeline Regulation. We own certain liquids and crude oil pipelines that are regulated by FERC as common carrier interstate pipelines under the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and related rules and orders. These assets include our ORV, VEX, Chickadee and Cajun-Sibon NGL pipelines.
     FERC regulation requires that interstate liquids pipeline rates and terms and conditions of service, including rates for transportation of crude oil, condensate and NGLs, be filed with FERC and that these rates and terms and conditions of service be “just and reasonable” and not unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential.
     Rates of interstate liquids pipelines are currently regulated by FERC primarily through an annual indexing methodology, under which pipelines increase or decrease their rates in accordance with an index adjustment specified by FERC. This adjustment is subject to review every five years. For the five-year period beginning on July 1, 2016, FERC established an annual index adjustment equal to the change in the producer price index for finished goods plus 1.23%. On October 20, 2016, however, FERC issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking indicating that FERC is considering a new policy that would deny proposed index increases for pipelines under certain circumstances where revenues exceed cost-of-service by a certain percentage or where the proposed index increases exceed certain annual cost changes reported to FERC. Under current FERC regulations, liquids pipelines can request a rate increase that exceeds the rate obtained through application of the indexing methodology by using a cost-of-service approach, but only after the pipeline establishes that a substantial divergence exists between the actual costs experienced by the pipeline and the rates resulting from application of the indexing methodology. The rates charged by our interstate liquids pipelines may also be affected by the ongoing uncertainty regarding FERC’s current income tax allowance policy discussed above. 
     The ICA permits interested persons to challenge proposed new or changed rates and authorizes FERC to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for up to seven months and investigate such rates. If, upon completion of an investigation, FERC finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful, it is authorized to require the pipeline to refund revenues collected in excess of the just and reasonable rate during the term of the investigation. FERC may also investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively. Under certain circumstances, FERC could limit our ability to set rates based on our costs or could order us to reduce our rates and pay reparations to complaining shippers for up to two years prior to the date of the complaint. FERC also has the authority to change our terms and conditions of service if it determines that they are unjust and unreasonable or unduly discriminatory or preferential.
     As we acquire, construct and operate new liquids assets and expand our liquids transportation business, the classification and regulation of our liquids transportation services are subject to ongoing assessment and change based on the services we provide and determinations by FERC and the courts. Such changes may subject additional services we provide to regulation by FERC.
     Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline Regulation. In addition to the Section 311 regulation discussed above, our intrastate natural gas pipeline operations are subject to regulation by various state agencies. Most state agencies possess the authority to review and authorize natural gas transportation transactions and the construction, acquisition, abandonment and interconnection of physical facilities. State agencies also may regulate transportation rates, service terms and conditions and contract pricing.

 
  22

 

     Intrastate Liquids Pipeline Regulation. Intrastate NGL and other petroleum pipelines are not generally subject to rate regulation by FERC, but they are subject to regulation by various agencies in the respective states where they are located. While such regulatory regimes vary, state agencies typically require intrastate NGL and petroleum pipelines to file their rates with the agencies and permit shippers to challenge existing rates or proposed rate increases.
     Gathering Pipeline Regulation. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of FERC under the NGA. We own a number of natural gas pipelines that we believe meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and therefore not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of substantial, on-going litigation, however, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation.
     In addition, we are subject to some state ratable take and common purchaser statutes. The ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply.
     Intrastate Natural Gas Storage Regulation. The storage field injection and withdrawal wells used in association with the Acacia system, along with water disposal wells located at the Bridgeport processing facility, are subject to the jurisdiction of the Railroad Commission of Texas (“TRRC”). TRRC regulations require that we report the volumes of natural gas and water disposal associated with the operations of such wells on a monthly and annual basis, respectively. Results of periodic mechanical integrity tests must also be reported to the TRRC.  In addition, our underground gas storage caverns in Louisiana are subject to the jurisdiction of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (“LDNR”).  In recent years, LDNR has put in place more comprehensive regulations governing underground hydrocarbon storage in salt caverns.        Sales of Natural Gas and NGLs. The prices at which we sell natural gas and NGLs currently are not subject to federal regulation and, for the most part, are not subject to state regulation. Our natural gas and NGL sales are affected by the availability, terms, cost and regulation of pipeline transportation. 
     Employee Safety. We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the OSHA requirements including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.
     Pipeline Safety Regulations. Our pipelines are subject to regulation by the DOT’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (“NGPSA”), and the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (“PSIA”).  The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of gas pipeline facilities.  The PSIA established mandatory inspections for all U.S. crude oil and natural gas transportation pipelines and some gathering lines in high-consequence areas (“HCAs”), which include, among other things, areas of high population density or that serve as sources of drinking water. PHMSA has developed regulations implementing the PSIA that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in HCAs. 
     The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011 increased penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines.  In April 2016, PHMSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking, or NPRM, addressing natural gas transmission and gathering lines. The proposed rule would, among other things, change existing integrity management requirements, expand assessment and repair requirements to pipelines in “moderate-consequence areas,” including areas of medium population density  and increase requirements for monitoring and inspection of pipeline segments located outside of HCAs.  Further, this NPRM would require that records or other data relied on to determine operating pressures must be traceable, verifiable and complete. 

 
  23

 
Locating such records and, in the absence of any such records, verifying maximum pressures through physical testing or modifying or replacing facilities, could significantly increase our costs. Additionally, failure to locate such records or verify maximum pressures could result in the reduction of allowable operating pressures, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines.
     In June 2016, the President of the United States signed the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (the “PIPES Act”), which reauthorizes PHMSA's oil and gas pipeline programs through 2019.  Pursuant to the PIPES Act, on December 14, 2016, PHMSA issued an interim final rule (“IFR”) that addresses safety issues related to downhole facilities. The IFR incorporates by reference two of the American Petroleum Institute’s Recommended Practice standards and mandates certain reporting requirements for operators of underground natural gas storage facilities. Along with other operators of natural gas storage facilities, we will have one year from January 18, 2017, the effective date of the IFR to implement this first set of PHMSA regulations governing underground storage fields.  
     In addition, on January 13, 2017, PHMSA finalized new hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations extending certain regulatory reporting requirements to all hazardous liquid gathering (including oil) pipelines.  The final rule requires additional event-driven and periodic inspections, requires the use of leak detection systems on all hazardous liquid pipelines, modifies repair criteria, and requires certain pipelines to eventually accommodate in-line inspection tools. The effective date of this final rule is currently uncertain due to a regulatory freeze implemented by the Trump administration on January 20, 2017.  
     On January 23, 2017, PHMSA published in the Federal Register amendments to the pipeline safety regulations to address requirements of the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 and to update and clarify certain regulatory requirements regarding notifications of accidents and incidents.  The final rule also adds provisions for cost recovery for design reviews of certain new projects, renews existing special permits, and incorporates certain standards for in-line inspections and stress corrosion cracking assessments.  The effective date of the final rule would have been March 24, 2017; however, the rule is subject to a regulatory freeze pending review by the Trump administration, unless exempted by PHMSA and OMB due to health and safety considerations.  
     At the state level, several states have passed legislation or promulgated rulemaking dealing with pipeline safety. We believe that our pipeline operations are in substantial compliance with applicable PHMSA and state requirements; however, due to the possibility of new or amended laws and regulations or reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that future compliance with PHMSA or state requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
     On November 2, 2015, PHMSA issued a Notice of Probable Violation and Proposed Compliance Order (the “NOPV”) asserting that we have probable violations of 49 CFR Part 195 due to the misclassification of a transmission line as a gathering line. Transmission lines are subject to more fulsome pipeline safety regulations than gathering lines. The NOPV proposed a compliance order requiring us to satisfy the Part 195 requirements applicable to transmission lines but did not propose a penalty. We disagree with the assertion of PHMSA that the pipeline meets the definition of a transmission rather than gathering line. Accordingly, on December 30, 2015, we objected to the NOPV and requested a hearing. The hearing took place on July 27, 2016, and we are awaiting a decision from PHMSA regarding the arguments presented at the hearing. We cannot predict the outcome of our challenge. In the event the pipeline in question is ultimately treated as a transmission line rather than a gathering line, we estimate that we would incur costs of approximately $2.1 million over a two-year period to develop and implement a Part 195-compliant integrity management program, including hydrostatic testing and a leak detection and repair program.

     Environmental Matters
     General. Our operations involve processing and pipeline services for delivery of hydrocarbons (natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensates) from point-of-origin at oil and gas wellheads operated by our suppliers to our end-use market customers. Our facilities include natural gas processing and fractionation plants, natural gas and NGL storage caverns, brine disposal wells, pipelines and associated facilities, fractionation and storage units for NGLs, and transportation and delivery of hydrocarbons. As with all companies in our industrial sector, our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances or solid wastes into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. Compliance with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall costs of doing business, including costs of planning, constructing, and operating plants, pipelines, and other facilities, as well as capital expenditures necessary to maintain or upgrade equipment and facilities. Similar costs are likely upon changes in laws or regulations and upon any future acquisition of operating assets. 
     Any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to equipment failures, and obtaining required governmental approvals, may result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory or remedial activities and, in certain, less common circumstances, issuance of temporary or permanent injunctions or construction or operation bans or delays. As part of the regular evaluation of our operations, we routinely review and update governmental approvals as necessary.
     The continuing trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. Moreover, risks of process upsets, accidental releases or spills are associated with possible future operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities, including those relating to claims for damage to property and persons as a result of any such upsets, releases or spills. We may be unable to pass on current or future environmental costs to our customers. A discharge or release of hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or solid wastes into the environment could, to the extent losses related to the event are not insured, subjects us to substantial expense, including both the cost to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to pay fines or penalties that may be assessed and the cost related to claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury or damage to natural resources or property. We attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to comply with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize costs with respect to more stringent future laws and regulations or more rigorous enforcement of existing laws and regulations.
     Hazardous Substances and Solid Waste. Environmental laws and regulations that relate to the release of hazardous substances or solid wastes into soils, sediments, groundwater and surface water and/or include measures to prevent and control pollution may pose the highest potential cost to our industrial sector. These laws and regulations generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid wastes and hazardous substances and may require investigatory and corrective actions at facilities where such waste or substance may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the federal “Superfund” law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to a release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. Potentially responsible persons include the owner or operator of the site where a release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at an off-site location, such as a landfill. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous substances have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. CERCLA also authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to public health or the environment and to seek recovery of costs they incur from the potentially responsible classes of persons. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or solid wastes released into the environment. Although petroleum, natural gas and NGLs are excluded from CERCLA’s definition of a “hazardous substance,” in the course of ordinary operations, we may generate wastes that may fall within the definition of a “hazardous substance.” In addition, there are other laws and regulations that can create liability for releases of petroleum, natural gas or NGLs. Moreover, we may be responsible under CERCLA or other laws for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such substances have been disposed. We have not received any notification that we may be potentially responsible for cleanup costs under CERCLA or any analogous federal, state, or local law.

     We also generate, and may in the future generate, both hazardous and nonhazardous solid wastes that are subject to requirements of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and/or comparable state statutes. From time to time, the EPA and state regulatory agencies have considered the adoption of stricter disposal standards for nonhazardous wastes, including crude oil, condensate and natural gas wastes. Moreover, it is possible that some wastes generated by us that are currently exempted from the definition of hazardous waste may in the future lose this exemption and be designated as “hazardous wastes,” resulting in the wastes being subject to more rigorous and costly management and disposal requirements. Additionally, the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) and analogous state laws impose requirements on the use, storage and disposal of various chemicals and chemical substances. Changes in applicable laws or regulations may result in an increase in our capital expenditures or plant operating expenses or otherwise impose limits or restrictions on our production and operations.
     We currently own or lease, have in the past owned or leased, and in the future may own or lease, properties that have been used over the years for brine disposal operations, crude oil and condensate transportation, natural gas gathering, treating or processing and for NGL fractionation, transportation or storage. Solid waste disposal practices within the NGL industry and other oil and natural gas related industries have improved over the years with the passage and implementation of various environmental laws and regulations. Nevertheless, some hydrocarbons and other solid wastes may have been released on or under various properties owned, leased or operated by us during the operating history of those properties. In addition, a number of these properties may have been operated by third parties over whose operations and hydrocarbon and waste management practices we had no control. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act, CERCLA, RCRA, TSCA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required, alone or in participation with others, to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination, if present, including groundwater contamination, or to take action to prevent future contamination.
     Air Emissions. Our current and future operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and regulations promulgated thereunder and under comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including our facilities, and impose various control, monitoring, and reporting requirements. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain environmental agency pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in an increase in existing air emissions, obtain and comply with the terms of air permits, which include various emission and operational limitations, or use specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. We likely will be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining governmental approvals addressing air emission-related issues. Failure to comply with applicable air statutes or regulations may lead to the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties and may result in the limitation or cessation of construction or operation of certain air emission sources or require us to incur additional capital expenditures. Although we can give no assurances, we believe such requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, and the requirements are not expected to be more burdensome to us than to any similarly situated company.
     In addition, the EPA included Wise County, the location of our Bridgeport facility, in its January 2012 revision to the Dallas-Ft. Worth ozone nonattainment area for the 2008 revised ozone national ambient air quality standard (“NAAQS”). As a result of this designation, new major sources in Wise County, meaning sources that emit greater than 100 tons/year of nitrogen oxides (“NOx”) and volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”), as well as major modifications of existing facilities in the county resulting in net emissions increases of greater than 40 tons/year of NOx or VOCs, are subject to more stringent new source review (“NSR”) pre-construction permitting requirements than they would be in an area that is in attainment with the 2008 ozone NAAQS. NSR pre-construction permits can take twelve to eighteen months to obtain and require the permit applicant to offset the proposed emission increases with reductions elsewhere at a 1.15 to 1 ratio.  On October 26, 2016, the EPA finalized its 2015 revised ozone NAAQS that, if implemented, will further restrict ozone within the Dallas-Ft. Worth nonattainment area.  The 2015 ozone NAAQS are being challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  The appeal remains pending.
     Effective May 15, 2012, the EPA promulgated rules under the Clean Air Act that established new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production, pipelines and processing operations under the New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAPs”) programs. These rules require the control of emissions through reduced emission (or “green”) completions and establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from wet seal and reciprocating compressors, pneumatic controllers, and storage

vessels at production facilities, gathering systems, boosting facilities, and onshore natural gas processing plants. In addition, the rules revised existing requirements for VOC emissions from equipment leaks at onshore natural gas processing plants by lowering the leak definition for valves from 10,000 parts per million to 500 parts per million and requiring the monitoring of connectors, pumps, pressure relief devices and open-ended lines. These rules required a number of modifications to our assets and operations.  In October 2012, several challenges to the EPA’s NSPS and NESHAPs rules for the industry were filed by various parties, including environmental groups and industry associations. In a January 16, 2013 unopposed motion to hold this litigation in abeyance, the EPA indicated that it may reconsider some aspects of the rules. The case remains in abeyance. The EPA has since revised certain aspects of the rules and has indicated that it may reconsider other aspects of the rules. Depending on the outcome of such proceedings, the rules may be further modified or rescinded or the EPA may issue new rules. We cannot predict the costs of compliance with any modified or newly issued rules.
     In partial response to the issues raised regarding the 2012 rulemaking, the EPA recently finalized new rules that took effect August 2, 2016 to regulate emissions of methane and VOCs from new and modified sources in the oil and gas sector.  The EPA also finalized a rule regarding alternative criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air quality permitting purposes. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements across the oil and gas industry. On November 10, 2016, the EPA issued a final Information Collection Request (“ICR”) that requires numerous oil and gas companies to provide information regarding methane emissions from existing oil and gas facilities, a step used to provide a basis for future rulemaking. We have received numerous EPA ICR requests, and are meeting with the EPA to discuss simplifying the requests. The EPA has delayed our ICR response deadline until these issues are resolved.  The Obama Administration also indicated that other federal agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), and the Department of Energy would be imposing new or more stringent regulations on the oil and gas sector in order to further reduce methane emissions. For example, the BLM adopted new rules on November 15, 2016, to be effective on January 17, 2017, to reduce venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and natural gas production activities on onshore federal and Indian leases. As a result of this continued regulatory focus and other factors, additional GHG regulation of the oil and gas industry remains possible. Compliance with such rules could result in additional costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs for us and for other companies in our industry. While we are not able at this time to estimate such additional costs, as is the case with similarly situated entities in the industry, they could be significant for us. Compliance with such rules, as well as any new state rules, may also make it more difficult for our suppliers and customers to operate, thereby reducing the volume of natural gas transported through our pipelines, which may adversely affect our business. However, the status of recent and future rules and rulemaking initiatives under the new Trump Administration is uncertain.
     Climate Change. In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases,” present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act, that require Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) pre construction permits, and Title V operating permits for greenhouse gas emissions from certain large stationary sources. Under these regulations, facilities required to obtain PSD permits must meet “best available control technology” standards for their greenhouse gas emissions established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case by case basis. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among others, certain onshore oil and natural gas processing and fractionating facilities. In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues.  Because regulation of greenhouse gas emissions is relatively new, further regulatory, legislative and judicial developments are likely to occur. Such developments in greenhouse gas initiatives may affect us and other companies operating in the oil and gas industry. In addition to these developments, recent judicial decisions have allowed certain tort claims alleging property damage to proceed against greenhouse gas emissions sources, which may increase our litigation risk for such claims. In addition, in 2015, the United States participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement entered into force November 4, 2016, and requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. The status of the United States’ commitment to Paris Agreement under the Trump Administration remains to be determined. Due to the uncertainties surrounding the regulation of and other risks associated with greenhouse gas emissions, we cannot predict the financial impact of related developments on us.

     Federal or state legislative or regulatory initiatives that regulate or restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business could adversely affect the availability of, or demand for, the products we store, transport and process, and, depending on the particular program adopted, could increase the costs of our operations, including costs to operate and maintain our facilities, install new emission controls on our facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our greenhouse gas emissions, pay any taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions and/or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program. We may be unable to recover any such lost revenues or increased costs in the rates we charge our customers, and any such recovery may depend on events beyond our control, including the outcome of future rate proceedings before FERC or state regulatory agencies and the provisions of any final legislation or regulations. Reductions in our revenues or increases in our expenses as a result of climate control initiatives could have adverse effects on our business our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
     Due to their location, our operations along the Gulf Coast are vulnerable to operational and structural damages resulting from hurricanes and other severe weather systems, while inland operations include areas subject to tornadoes. Our insurance may not cover all associated losses. We are taking steps to mitigate physical risks from storms, but no assurance can be given that future storms will not have a material adverse effect on our business.
     Hydraulic Fracturing and Wastewater. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including NGL-related wastes, into state waters or waters of the United States. In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers finalized a rule intended to clarify the meaning of the term “waters of the United States,” which establishes the scope of regulated waters under the Clean Water Act. The rule has been challenged and was stayed by federal courts.  Absent Congressional action, the rule will become applicable if the courts do not continue the stay of the rule during the litigation; if upheld, the rule is expected to expand federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. Regulations promulgated pursuant to the Clean Water Act require that entities that discharge into federal and state waters obtain National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permits and/or state permits authorizing these discharges. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws assess administrative, civil and criminal penalties for discharges of unauthorized pollutants into the water and impose substantial liability for the costs of removing spills from such waters. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require that individual permits or coverage under general permits be obtained by covered facilities for discharges of storm water runoff. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with Clean Water Act permitting requirements as well as the conditions imposed by our permits and that continued compliance with such existing permit conditions will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
     We operate brine disposal wells that are regulated as Class II wells under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”). The SDWA imposes requirements on owners and operators of Class II wells through the EPA’s Underground Injection Control program, including construction, operating, monitoring and testing, reporting and closure requirements. Our brine disposal wells are also subject to comparable state laws and regulations, which in some cases are more stringent than requirements under the federal SDWA, such as the Ohio Department of Natural Resources rules that took effect October 1, 2012.  These rules set new, more stringent standards for the permitting and operating of brine disposal wells, including extensive review of geologic data and use of state-of-the-art technology. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources also imposes requirements on the transportation and disposal of brine. Compliance with current and future laws and regulations regarding our brine disposal wells may impose substantial costs and restrictions on our brine disposal operations, as well as adversely affect demand for our brine disposal services. State and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste waters and an observed increase in minor seismic activity and tremors. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In a few instances, operators of injection wells in the vicinity of minor seismic events have reduced injection volumes or suspended operations, often voluntarily. A 2012 report published by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that only a very small fraction of the tens of thousands of injection wells have been suspected to be, or have been, the likely cause of induced seismicity.  However, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations to account for induced seismicity. For example, TRRC rules allow the TRRC to modify, suspend, or terminate a permit based on a determination that the permitted activity is likely to be contributing to seismic activity.  In the state of Ohio, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (“ODNR”) requires a seismic study prior to the authorization of any new disposal well.  In addition, the ODNR has instituted a continuous monitoring network of seismographs and is able to curtail injected volumes regionally based upon seismic activity detected. The Oklahoma Corporation Commission has also taken steps to focus on induced seismicity, including increasing the frequency of required recordkeeping for wells that dispose into certain formations and considering seismic information in permitting

decisions. For instance, on August 3, 2015, the OCC adopted a plan calling for mandatory reductions in oil and gas wastewater disposal well volumes, the implementation of which has involved reductions of injection or shut-ins of disposal wells. Regulatory agencies are continuing to study possible linkage between injection activity and induced seismicity. To the extent these studies result in additional regulation of injection wells, such regulations could impose additional regulations, costs and restrictions on our brine disposal operations.
     It is common for our customers or suppliers to recover natural gas from deep shale formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing, combined with sophisticated horizontal drilling. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of wells by oil and gas producers. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate gas production. Due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states and localities have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and other regulatory requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations of our customers and suppliers.  There are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices, and a committee of the United States House of Representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released a study of the potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health, concluding that there is scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities potentially can impact drinking water resources in the United States under some circumstances. This study or similar studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing.  In June 2016, the EPA finalized rules prohibiting discharges of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants.  The EPA has also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act to gather information regarding the potential regulation of chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration and production.  Also, effective June 24, 2015, BLM adopted rules regarding well stimulation, chemical disclosures, water management, and other requirements for hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands; however, a federal district court invalidated these BLM rules in June 2016 and an appeal is pending.  Additional regulatory burdens in the future, whether federal, state or local, could increase the cost of or restrict the ability of our customers or suppliers to perform hydraulic fracturing. As a result, any increased federal, state or local regulation could reduce the volumes of natural gas that our customers move through our gathering systems which would materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
     Endangered Species and Migratory Birds. The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), Migratory Bird Treaty Act (“MBTA”), and similar state and local laws restrict activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats or migratory birds. Some of our pipelines may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, potentially exposing us to liability for impacts on an individual member of a species or to habitat. The Endangered Species Act can also make it more difficult to secure a federal permit for a new pipeline.
     Office Facilities
     We occupy approximately 108,500 square feet of space at our executive offices in Dallas, Texas under a lease expiring in August 2019. In November 2014, we entered into a new agreement to lease approximately 157,600 square feet of space for our executive offices in Dallas, Texas with a lease term commencing in August 2016 and expiring in February 2030.     Employees
     As of December 31, 2016, we (through our subsidiaries) employed approximately 1,472 full-time employees. Approximately 336 of our employees were general and administrative, engineering, accounting and commercial personnel and the remainder were operational employees. We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements and we have not had any significant labor disputes in the past. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
