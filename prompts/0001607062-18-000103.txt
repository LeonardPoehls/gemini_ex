Management
 
Overall project development is led by Hans Rigendinger, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Charles Fessel, Project Director, and Ernst Rosenberger, our Corporate Controller. The lead architect is Ossenbach, Pendones & Bonilla, one of Costa Rica’s largest architectural offices. Civil engineering services are provided by DEHC Engineers, and structural engineering services by IEAC. Our landscape architects are TPA and our interior designers are led by Laboratorio Quattro.
 
We have entered into a resort management agreement with Melía Hotels International (“Melía”). “Paradisus” is Meliá’s five-star all-inclusive luxury hotel brand that is well recognized in the hospitality industry around the world. Melía was founded in 1956 in Palma de Mallorca, Spain and is today one of the world’s largest resort hotel chains, as well as Spain’s leading hotel chain for business or leisure. Melía offers more than 300 hotels in 26 countries over four continents under its Gran Sol Melía, Sol Melía, ME by Sol Melía, Innside by Sol Melía, Tryp, Sol Melía, Sol Melía Vacation Club, and Paradisus brands. The Paradisus brand presently represents all-inclusive luxury resorts with hotels in the region from Mexico to the Dominican Republic.
 
Since the completion date for the Paradisus Papagayo Bay Resort & Luxury Villas project has been delayed until at least mid-2020, the completion date provided in the amended management agreement with Melía cannot be met. We are currently in negotiations with Melía to either amend the agreement to extend the completion date, or seek another suitable management company for the project. Our existing agreement with Melía stipulates the following major conditions:
 

a. | Completion date: September 15, 2018 (subject to force majeure) 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b. | Should the completion not occur by September 15, 2018, and if the parties not have agreed to an extension to such date, after September 15, 2018, the Company will be required to pay Melía a daily amount of $2,000 as liquidated damages. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c. | Should the completion not occur by November 15, 2018, and should Melía not agree to a time extension, the Company will be obligated to pay Meliá $5,000,000 as liquidated damages. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
No amendment to the management agreement with Melía has been reached, nor have we engaged an alternative management company for the project. Based on our current agreement with Melía, the Company has recognized a provision for liquidated damages in the amount of $5,120,000 as of December 31, 2017.

Additional Concessions
 
On April 24, 2013, the Company entered into new agreements for the purchase of two additional concession properties located in Polo Papagayo, Guanacaste for a total of $17,500,000. The terms of the agreements included amounts payable to the seller and a third party against a refundable deposit of $1,369,816 minus a non-refundable amount of $300,000 and a liqudated damages penalty of 5% in the event the purchase did not close. The Company failed to perform according to the terms of the purchase agreements and the transaction was terminated by the third party and thereafter by the Company. All expenses related to the agreements with the seller and the third party seller, were impaired as of December 31, 2016, and subsequent to the dismissal of legal proceeding fully written-off as of December 31, 2017.
Finance
 
The anticipated completion of the Paradisus Papagayo Bay Resort & Luxury Villas mid-2020 will require a net investment of approximately $215 million (excluding non-recuperated overhead expenses), of which approximately $60 million (excluding capitalized interest) has been expended as of December 31, 2017. We aim to realize a minimum of $150 million in new funding over the next twelve months.

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
Three key factors have been taken into consideration when defining our hotel competitors in relation to the Paradisus Papagayo Bay Resort & Luxury Villas:
 

— | the proximity of competitors to our location in Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


— | the consumption habits of prospective clientele 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


— | the ability to compete based on product similarity in relation to service standards, facilities, the availability of equipment and the number or variety of services offered. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Based on our criteria we have determined that our prospective competitors are those characterized as five- star holiday resorts in geographic proximity to our planned location.
 
Luxury Hotel Resorts
 
We distinguish between primary and secondary competitors.
 
Primary competition in Guanacaste Province is comprised of the following properties:
 

— | Four Seasons Peninsula Papagayo

All of our primary competitive establishments have common characteristics with a standard vacation resort format with much more equipment and many more facilities to offer than hotels based in a city such as:

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


— | ample water areas with outdoor swimming pools, areas for hammocks and sun bathing 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


— | Fitness Center, Wellness Center and Spa Areas 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our competitors are managed by leading international chains or experienced domestic companies. Despite what might be construed as obvious obstacles to entry, including robust competition within the hospitality industry in Guanacaste Province, we believe that the Paradisus Papagayo Bay Resort & Luxury Villas will be successful based principally on the following factors:
 

— | the beach front location of the development 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


— | environmental integrity in project development and operation 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


— | the reputation of the Paradisus brand in the region and internationally 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Furthermore, we believe that we have certain distinctive competitive advantages over all or many of our competitors including:
 

— | location in one of the most appealing areas worldwide 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


— | outstanding product with unique features 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


— | superior project development and management agreements that maximize resources and broaden market penetration 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that all of the factors detailed above, in combination with the dedication of our personnel and partners, will enable the Paradisus Papagayo Bay Resort & Luxury Villas to successfully compete with its local competition.
 
Marketability
Costa Rican Tourism
 
Costa Rica has a long track record of political stability along with a well-established outward-looking growth model. The government has adopted a proactive policy of fostering higher-end beach resort tourism, mainly through fiscal incentives for investors. As such, Costa Rica benefits from a burgeoning hotel development pipeline and is emerging as a regional hotel investment hot-spot that includes luxury hotels. This environment provides fertile ground for real estate investors and developers. Investment in tourism is projected to continue this upward trend over the next several years as demand outpaces the supply of existing lodging and tourism services.
 
The 2017 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (“TTCI”), indicates that Costa Rica is ranked 38th place in the world (up 9 places since 2013), and is classified as one of the most competitive countries in Latin American. According to the TTCI report Costa Rica ranks 3rd in the world for natural resources and is also notable for other advantages, such as its prioritization of travel & tourism ranking 24th and its tourism services infrastructure ranking 30th.

Costa Rica stands as the most visited nation in the Central American region. The Costa Rican Tourism Institute (“ICT”) is responsible for collecting information on the number and economic impact of tourists that visit Costa Rica. ICT also collects information related to hotel rooms and the country of origin for tourists arriving in Costa Rica. Records produced by ICT detail that the number of tourists visiting Costa Rica reached 2.93 million in 2016, representing an increase of 10 % over 2015.
 
ICT has determined that the most relevant origin markets in terms of demand are the United States, Canada and Mexico which generated approximately 52% of all tourists in 2016 followed by Central American countries including Guatemala, El Salvador, Panama and Nicaragua, which generated approximately 25% of the tourists arriving in Costa Rica. According to official data, the United States remains the largest source of tourists to Costa Rica with a total of 1,233,277 in 2016, representing 42.1% of all visitors. Tourists visiting Costa Rica from European countries represented approximately 15% of all tourists in 2016 led by the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, France and Italy.
 
Geography
 
Costa Rica’s Guanacaste Province is bound in the east by a group of vegetated volcanoes and the west by beaches on the Pacific Ocean. The province contains heavily forested areas and seven national parks, and includes the Area de Conservación Guanacaste World Heritage Site. Guanacaste is the northern-most province of Costa Rica, with the Papagayo Bay a 40-minute flight from San Jose and a half hour car transfer to the beach. Tourism has emerged as the most lucrative revenue source in the province. Tourists to the Guanacaste Province of Costa Rica are most often motivated by a desire for favorable weather and beach conditions. Active tourism – those activities including canopying, trekking, visiting volcanoes and flora or fauna watching – are secondary considerations.
 
We believe that our development is well located for a hospitality property.
 
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements and Labor Contracts
 
The Company holds no patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, or concessions other than having registered its “SunVesta” trademark in various countries.
 
The Company is not subject to any labor contracts.
 
Governmental and Environmental Regulation

Our operations are subject to a variety of national, federal, provincial and local laws, rules and regulations relating to, among other things, worker safety and the use, storage, discharge and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all laws, rules, regulations and requirements that affect our business. Further, we believe that compliance with such laws, rules, regulations and requirements do not impose a material impediment on our ability to conduct business.
Costa Rican National Environmental Office
 
The Costa Rican National Environmental Office (“SETENA”) created by the Organic Environmental Law is tasked with administering the process of reviewing and evaluating environmental impact considerations. Local municipal governments often require a ruling from SETENA before issuing building permits. Any large project in Costa Rica must apply for an Environmental Impact Statement from SETENA before development is permitted. Delays associated with this process have had a negative impact on the Company’s project in Guanacaste Province.

The Company is not aware of any existing environmental impact issues that could have a material effect on the development of the Paradisus Papagayo Bay Resort & Luxury Villas.
 
Costa Rican Sustainable Development
 
Costa Rica is considered as being in the forefront of implementing environmental policies. The country’s national strategies for sustainable development are a broad matrix of policies requiring eco-friendly practices, such as Agenda 21. The Agenda 21 process as developed by the 1992 and 2002 Earth Summits is defined as a participative planning tool in which sectors in the government and civil society concertedly determine the course to be taken by their communities, regions, or countries in pursuit of sustainable development. This process and other Costa Rican sustainable development policies have delayed or increased our cost for the development of the property.
 
The Company is not aware of any existing environmental impact issues that could have a material effect on the development of the Paradisus Papagayo Bay Resort & Luxury Villas.
 
Climate Change Legislation and Greenhouse Gas Regulation
 
Many studies over the past couple decades have indicated that emissions of certain gases contribute to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere. In response to these studies, many nations agreed to limit emissions of “greenhouse gases” or “GHGs” pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the “Paris Agreement” to which Costa Rica is a signatory. Greenhouse gas legislation in Costa Rica could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company is not aware of any existing environmental impact issues that could have a material effect on our development.
Employees

The Company is a development stage company and currently has five employees at December 31, 2017. Our management uses consultants, attorneys, and accountants to assist in the conduct of our business.
