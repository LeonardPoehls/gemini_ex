 Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to School Specialty, SSI, the Company, we or our refer to School Specialty, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Effective December 26, 2015 the Company changed its fiscal year end from the last Saturday in April to the last Saturday in December. The December 27, 2015 to December 31, 2016 period will be referred to as fiscal 2016 in this report. The April 26, 2015 to December 26, 2015 period will be referred to as the short year 2015 in this report. Prior to April 26, 2015, our fiscal year ended on the last Saturday in April of each year. In this Annual Report, we refer to these fiscal years by reference to the calendar year in which they ended (e.g., the fiscal year ended April 25, 2015 is referred to as fiscal 2015). 
 Company Overview 
 School Specialty is a leading distributor of supplies, furniture, technology products, supplemental learning products (instructional solutions) and curriculum solutions, primarily to the education marketplace. The Company provides educators with its own innovative and proprietary products and services, from basic school supplies to 21st century classroom designs to Science, Reading, Language and Math teaching materials, as well as planning and development tools. Through its nationwide distribution network, School Specialty also provides its customers with access to a broad spectrum of well-recognized, third-party brands across its product categories. This assortment strategy enables the Company to offer a broad range of products primarily serving the pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade (PreK-12) education market at the state, district and school levels. The Company is expanding its presence beyond the education market by establishing relationships with e-tailers and retailers and marketing a sub-set of its offering to healthcare facilities and the purchasing organizations that serve them. School Specialty offers its products through two operating groups: Distribution and Curriculum. 
 We believe our Distribution group offers educators the broadest range and deepest assortment of basic school supplies, instructional solutions, furniture and equipment, technology products, physical education products, and other classroom and school equipment available from a single supplier. This breadth of offering and unique positioning creates competitive advantages in our ability to aggregate an assortment of products to meet customer requirements across multiple categories. This group further differentiates itself through its distribution network and nationwide sales force, able to reach substantially all schools nationwide, as well as the Canadian marketplace. Another core differentiator is our commitment to innovation, which is achieved by working with teachers, administrators and other subject matter experts to develop proprietary products that result in innovative approaches to student development and learning. 
 Our Curriculum group develops proprietary curriculum programs to help educators deepen students subject matter understanding and accelerate the learning process. This group offers curriculum and supplemental learning solutions for science, reading and math and works with teachers and educators to drive new offerings based on standards, such as Common Core State Standards and Next Generation Science Standards, as well as its own and third-party customized products for various grade levels (primarily PreK-12). The Curriculum group also offers a number of innovative and highly targeted teaching solutions for educators designed to help students who are performing below grade level or who could benefit from supplemental instruction in a specific area of learning. This group continues to expand its portfolio of instructional programs, combining print-based and digital instructional and assessment tools to deliver value to educators and build competitive advantages in the marketplace. 
 Across both groups, we reach our customers through a sales force of approximately 350 professionals (approximately 100 of which are inside sales representatives), 8.3 million catalogs, and our proprietary e-commerce websites. In fiscal 2016, we believe we sold products to approximately 63% of the approximately 138,000 schools in the United States and we believe we reached a majority of the 3.5 million teachers in those schools. For fiscal 2016, we generated revenues of $656.3 million.

The following is a more complete description of our two operating groups, or segments. Financial information about our segments, as well as geographic information, is included in Note 16 under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 Distribution Segment. Our Distribution segment provides a wide assortment of products, solutions and services primarily to the PreK-12 education market, e-tail and retail channel partners, and to the healthcare market. Products include a comprehensive line of everyday consumables, specialized supplies, indoor and outdoor furniture and equipment, technology products, instructional teaching materials, and planning and organizational products, among others. Distribution products are sold via a nationwide sales force and distribution network, with reach to the majority of schools throughout the United States. Distribution products are also sold direct to teachers and to consumers through the Companys various e-commerce platforms. Distribution products are grouped into five product categories which include: 
 

 | Supplies
--+---------


 | Furniture
--+----------


 | Instructional Solutions
--+------------------------


 | Student Organization and Planning Products
--+-------------------------------------------


 | A/V Technology
--+---------------

 By working closely with school administrators, teachers and other educators, the Distribution segment employs a curation strategy, offering a solutions-based approach across multiple product categories. The Company helps schools with their purchasing decisions by offering a suite of value-added products and services to fit within budget parameters, while also helping to manage supply chain issues, and back-to-school logistics to help school administrators save both time and money. This segment also offers project management and design services through its Project by Design® team (PbD), for both school refurbishment and new construction projects. As an end-to-end solution provider for schools, PbD is able to help schools outfit both indoor and outdoor school facilities with state-of-the-art furniture and equipment, while also serving as a single source for additional proprietary and/or third-party branded products. 
 Distribution products include both proprietary branded products and other national brands. Among the segments well-known proprietary brands are Childcraft®, Sax® Arts & Crafts, Califone®, Premier AgendasTM, Classroom Select®, Sportime®, Abilitations®, Hammond & StephensTM, SPARK®, Brodhead Garrett®, School Smart®, Royal Seating®, and Projects by Design®. Distribution products and services accounted for approximately 84% of our revenues for fiscal 2016. 
 Curriculum Segment. Our Curriculum segment is a publisher of proprietary and nonproprietary core, supplemental and intervention curriculum in the following areas of the PreK-12 education market: 
 

 | Science
--+--------


 | Math
--+-----


 | Comprehension, Vocabulary, Spelling and Grammar
--+------------------------------------------------


 | Reading and Math Intervention
--+------------------------------

 Products in our Curriculum segment are typically sold to teachers, curriculum specialists and other educators with direct responsibility for advancing student outcomes. 
 The Curriculum segment develops standards-based curriculum products, supplemental and intervention curriculum materials, instructional programs and student assessment tools. Its offerings are tailored to address specific learning needs, drive improved student performance, engage learners and accelerate the learning process. 
 
3 
 
 A team of approximately 20 product development associates leverage long-standing relationships with outside developers, authors, co-publishing strategic partners and consultants to develop educational products and solutions that meet curriculum standards and improve classroom teaching effectiveness. 
 Our product portfolio is guided by PreK-12 curriculum standards, which can vary by state. However, there is a consistency throughout the portfolio that allows for the creation of nationally marketed programs that can be customized to meet state-specific curriculum standards where needed. We believe our Curriculum segment provides a broad collection of educational programs that effectively combines supplemental curriculum solutions, academic planning and organization, inquiry based (hands-on) learning, comprehensive learning kits, extensive performance assessments, and consultant-led or web-delivered teacher training. New reading solutions, for example, combine research proven materials, technology, and teaching methods to create dynamic, systematic, and individualized instruction. Additionally, when applicable these solutions are designed to address Common Core State Standards at various grade levels as well as Next Generation Science Standards. 
 Our Curriculum segment product lines include Delta Education®, FOSS®, CPO ScienceTM, Frey Scientific®, Educators Publishing Service®, Academy of Reading®, Academy of Math®, Wordly Wise 3000®, Explode the Code®, ThinkMath!TM, Making Connections® and S.P.I.R.E®. Our Curriculum products accounted for approximately 16% of our revenues in fiscal 2016.

 Industry Overview 
 The United States PreK-12 education market is a large industry that has historically exhibited attractive and stable growth characteristics, despite fluctuations in the U.S. economy. For example, during the recessions of 1981-1983, 1991-1992 and 2001-2002, PreK-12 education funding in the United States grew at compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) of 5.3%, 5.0% and 4.7%, respectively. However, the significant downturn in the general economy from 2008 through 2013 resulted in education spending ranging from flat to low single digit growth rates (0.1% to 1.8%). Total expenditures for public elementary and secondary education were $590 billion in 2008-2009 and grew to $613 billion in 2012-2013, or a 1.0% CAGR, according to the National Education Association (NEA). Since 2012-2013, however, total expenditures have increased to $662 billion through 2014-2015, or a CAGR of 3.9%, according to the Rankings of States 2015 and Estimate of School Statistics 2016 published by the NEA in 2016. The NEA estimates that total expenditures increased to $675 billion in 2015-2016. Over the long-term, we expect total educational expenditures (excluding capital outlays and interest on debt) to continue to increase at mid-single digit growth rates based on projections from both the NEA and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). 
 Public education funding for school districts during 2014-2015 came from three major sources: state funding which provided about 44%; local funding which provided about 44%; and federal funding which provided about 12%. State funding for elementary and secondary education is generally allocated to school districts by formulas, typically based on number of pupils. State general funding expenditure budgets are

 projected to grow 4.3% in 2017, with a majority of the increase allocated to the two largest areas of state general funding expenditures, PreK-12 education and Medicaid. While there is significant variation within individual states, forty-one states have enacted budgets for fiscal 2017 with higher general fund spending levels as compared to fiscal 2016 according to the National Association of State Budget Officers. The majority of the funding provided by local governments is from property taxes. Local tax revenues have been relatively flat according to the most recent data from NEA; however, increases in 2016 housing starts and projected increases in new home sale prices could be expected to drive up property tax collections and local tax revenue. The two largest programs providing federal funding are the No Child Left Behind Title I Grants to school districts and the IDEA Special Education State Grants. 
 According to the NCES, enrollment in public and private elementary and secondary schools has had slow and steady growth over the past 15 years with a CAGR of 0.4% and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 0.5% through 2024. Specifically, NCES projects that public and private PreK-12 enrollment will rise from $55.0 million in the 2012-2013 school year to $57.9 million by the 2024-2025 school year. At the same time, per pupil expenditures are expected to rise each year. Expenditures in public elementary and secondary schools were $11,640 per pupil in 2014-2015 and are expected to rise to $12,460 per pupil, in constant dollars, by 2024-2025. 
 There is increased activity at the federal level to increase investments in education, with a renewed focus on early learning. We believe there is also increasing demand for new school construction and retrofits. This belief is supported by industry reports from McGraw-Hill that indicate the amount of new K-12 school construction spending is expected to grow from an estimated $24 billion in 2014 to $36 billion by 2017. This growth in construction spending is related to a combination of higher enrollment levels and the impact of lower investment levels in recent years as maintenance construction projects were deferred and school districts placed an additional number of students into its existing facilities. 
 Our focus within the North America PreK-12 education market is on basic school supplies, indoor and outdoor furniture and equipment, technology solutions, instructional solutions and curriculum-based teaching materials in targeted subject areas. Our customers are teachers, curriculum specialists, individual schools and school districts who purchase products, instructional programs and materials, and teacher resources for school and classroom use. Our customers are also parents who purchase similar products for their children via our proprietary e-commerce platform or those of our e-tail/retail channel partners, as well as administrators in various healthcare related markets. The educational products and equipment market is highly fragmented with many retail and wholesale companies providing products and equipment, a majority of which are family- or employee-owned, regional companies. However, the market is also served by several large, well-recognized, national companies. 
 The standards-based curriculum market is highly competitive and School Specialty competes with several large, well-known education companies as well as smaller, niche companies. In certain states, Curriculum purchases are heavily influenced by statewide adoptions which typically occur on multi-year cycle; in open territory states, Curriculum decisions are more often made at the district level. According to industry reports from the American Association of Publishers and Education Market Research, the K-12 Curriculum market was estimated to be $10 billion in 2014 and is expected to grow to in excess of $11 billion by 2017. 
 We believe there is increasing customer demand for single source suppliers, prompt order fulfillment and competitive pricing in todays economic environment, particularly as school districts centralize their purchasing decision-making and/or increasingly seek to participate in local, state, regional or national purchasing cooperatives. We believe these changes should drive growth in our instructional and educational products as well as our general school supplies, furniture and equipment and other technology-based solutions. We also believe that in the long-term, these industry trends will have a favorable competitive impact on our business, and that we are well positioned to utilize our operational capabilities, recognized proprietary and third-party brands, respected educational content and curriculum development expertise, and broad product offering to meet evolving customer demands.

Bankruptcy Filing 
 On January 28, 2013, School Specialty, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the Bankruptcy Court). The cases (the Chapter 11 Cases) were jointly administered as Case No. 13-10125 (KJC) under the caption In re School Specialty, Inc., et al. The Debtors continued to operate their business as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Chapter 11 and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The Companys foreign subsidiaries were not part of the Chapter 11 Cases. 
 The Chapter 11 Cases were filed in response to an environment of ongoing declines in school spending and a lack of sufficient liquidity, including trade credit provided by the Debtors vendors, to permit the Debtors to pursue their business strategy to position the School Specialty brands successfully for the long-term. As a result of the Chapter 11 filing, the Companys common stock was delisted from the NASDAQ Stock Market, effective March 1, 2013. 
 On May 23, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Debtors Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the Reorganization Plan), and a corrected copy of such order was entered by the Bankruptcy Court on June 3, 2013. The Reorganization Plan, which is described in additional detail below, became effective on June 11, 2013 (the Effective Date). Pursuant to the Reorganization Plan, on the Effective Date, the Companys existing credit agreements, outstanding convertible subordinated debentures, equity plans and certain other agreements were cancelled. In addition, all outstanding equity interests of the Company that were issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Date were cancelled on the Effective Date. Also on the Effective Date, in accordance with and as authorized by the Reorganization Plan, the Company reincorporated in Delaware and issued a total of 1,000,004 shares of Common Stock of the reorganized Company to holders of certain allowed claims against the Debtors in exchange for such claims. As of June 12, 2013, there were 60 record holders of the new common stock of the reorganized Company issued pursuant to the Reorganization Plan. 
 The Reorganization Plan 
 General 
 The Reorganization Plan generally provided for the payment in full in cash on or as soon as practicable after the Effective Date of specified claims, including: 

 | All claims (the DIP Financing Claims) under the Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement (the ABL DIP Agreement) by and among Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC (as Administrative Agent, Co-Collateral Agent, Co-Lead Arranger and Joint Book Runner) and GE Capital Markets, Inc. (as Co-Collateral Agent, Co-Lead Arranger and Joint Book Runner and Syndication Agent), General Electric Capital Corporation (as syndication agent), the lenders party to the ABL DIP Agreement, and the Company and certain of its subsidiaries;

--+-------------------------------------


 | All claims relating to the costs and expenses of administering the Chapter 11 Cases; and

 | Each holder of an unsecured claim arising from the provision of goods and/or services to the Debtors in the ordinary course of its pre-petition trade relationship with the Debtors, with whom the reorganized Debtors continue to do business after the Effective Date, is entitled to receive a deferred cash payment equal to 20% of such claim, plus interest, on the terms described in the Reorganization Plan. Such holders may increase their percentage recoveries to 45%, plus interest, by electing to provide the reorganized Debtors with customary trade terms for a specified period, as described in the Reorganization Plan;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Each holder of the Companys 3.75% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2026, as further described elsewhere in this report, received its pro rata share of 35% of the common stock of the reorganized Company;

 | Each holder of an allowed general unsecured claim or allowed trade unsecured claim of $3,000 or less, or any holder of a general unsecured claim or trade unsecured claim in excess of $3,000 that agreed to voluntarily reduce the amount of its claim to $3,000 under the terms described in the Reorganization Plan, was entitled to receive a cash payment equal to 20% of such allowed claim on or as soon as practicable after the Effective Date; and

 | Holders of equity interests in the Company prior to the Effective Date, including claims arising out of or with respect to such equity interests, were not entitled to receive any distribution under the Reorganization Plan.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exit Facilities 
 As of the Effective Date, the Debtors closed on the exit credit facilities, the proceeds of which were or will be, among other things, used to (i) pay in cash the DIP Financing Claims, to the extent provided for in the Reorganization Plan, (ii) make required distributions under the Reorganization Plan, (iii) satisfy certain Reorganization Plan-related expenses, and (iv) fund the reorganized Companys working capital needs. The terms of the exit credit facilities are described under Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below. 
Equity Interests 
 As mentioned above, all shares of the Companys common stock outstanding prior to the Effective Date were cancelled and extinguished as of the Effective Date. In accordance with the Reorganization Plan, on the Effective Date, the reorganized Company issued the new common stock, subject to dilution pursuant to the 2014 Incentive Plan (as defined and described below). The Company issued 1,000,004 shares of new common stock on the Effective Date pursuant to the Reorganization Plan, which constitutes the total number of shares of new common stock outstanding immediately following the Effective Date, subject to dilution pursuant to the 2014 Incentive Plan. 
 On the Effective Date, equity interests in the Companys U.S. subsidiaries were deemed cancelled and extinguished and of no further force and effect, and each reorganized subsidiary was deemed to issue and distribute the new subsidiary equity interests. The ownership and terms of such new subsidiary equity interests in the reorganized subsidiaries are the same as the ownership and terms of the equity interests in these subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Date, except as otherwise provided in the Reorganization Plan.

Competitive Strengths 
 We attribute our strong competitive position to the following key factors: 
 A Market Leader in Fragmented Industry. We are one of the largest providers of educational supplies, furniture and equipment, and both standards-based and supplemental curriculum products to the PreK-12 education markets in the United States and Canada. Within our industry, we compete with many retail and wholesale competitors, a majority of which are family or employee-owned, regional companies. We believe that our scale and scope of operations relative to our education market competitors provide several competitive advantages, including a broader product offering, advantageous purchasing power, a national distribution network and the ability to manage the seasonality and peak shipping requirements of the school purchasing cycle. 
 Large Product Offering and Recognized, Proprietary Brands. Providing access to over 100,000 items ranging from classroom supplies, school furniture and playground equipment, technology solutions and both standards-based and supplemental curriculum solutions, we believe we are a leading national provider of a broad range of supplemental educational products and equipment to meet substantially all of the needs of schools and teachers in the PreK-12 education market. Our products include over 20 proprietary brands, as well as many widely recognized third-party brands. Our breadth of offerings creates opportunities to repurpose or repackage traditional supplemental materials with supplemental curriculum solutions into kits or groups of related items that our customers value. In addition, we believe we offer many of the most established brands in the industry that are recognized by educators across the country, with some brands more than 100 years old. Our assortment strategy, which combines our proprietary brands with other trusted third-party brands to create comprehensive offerings in a broad range of product categories, enables us to serve our customers in a manner that we believe is unmatched in the industry. As such, we are in a position to leverage our depth, breadth and brand portfolio to further penetrate key product categories. Over 40% of our revenues are derived from our proprietary products, including the majority of our curriculum segment products; typically, our proprietary products generate higher margins than our non-proprietary products. 
 Strong Customer Reach and Relationships. We have developed a highly integrated, three-tiered sales and marketing approach, consisting of: a national sales force; paper-based catalogs and digital marketing campaigns; and our proprietary e-commerce websites. We believe this approach provides us with a unique ability to reach teachers and curriculum specialists as well as school district and individual school administrators. The wide assortment of products and solutions we offer has enabled us to establish strong and long-standing relationships with many of the largest school districts across the United States and Canada. We reach our customers through the industrys largest sales force of approximately 350 professionals (approximately 100 of which are inside sales representatives), catalog mailings and our proprietary e-commerce websites. In fiscal 2016, we estimate that we sold products to approximately 63% of the estimated 138,000 schools in the United States and reached a majority of the 3.7 million teachers in those schools. We also estimate that, on average, we have enjoyed more than a 10-year relationship with our top accounts, and have recently invested in building our inside sales force to improve our nationwide coverage. We utilize our extensive customer databases to selectively target the appropriate customers for our catalog offerings and digital marketing campaigns. Additionally, we have invested heavily in the development of our e-commerce websites, which provide broad product offerings and which we believe generate higher internet sales than many of our education competitors. Revenues derived directly from internet sales, which were approximately 27% of our sales in fiscal 2016 compared to less than 17% of our sales in fiscal 2009, have increased as more school districts and teachers go online to place orders. 
 Highly Diversified Business Mix. Our broad product portfolio and geographic reach minimize our concentration and exposure to any one school district, state, product or supplier. In fiscal 2016, our top 10 school district customers collectively accounted for just over 8% of revenues and customers within our top state collectively accounted for just over 11% of revenues. For the same period, our top 100 products accounted for slightly less than 12% of revenues. Products from our top 10 suppliers generated just over 30% of revenues in fiscal 2016. We believe this diversification somewhat limits our exposure to state and local funding cycles and to 
 
8 
 
 product demand trends, and at the same time, opens up opportunities for growth as educational spending increases, both with current and new customer accounts. 
 Strong Repeat Business. Over 70% of our revenues are generated from the sale of consumable products, which typically need to be ordered annually, if not more frequently. We continue to maintain strong relationships with schools, school districts and other customers and believe our retention rate of our school and school district customers is over 90% in a highly competitive business. We continue to evaluate and modify our product assortment, particularly in the consumable product area to ensure we have the right solutions for our customers and to capitalize on the recurring revenue opportunities from many of our long-standing accounts. 
 Strong Cost Controls and Focus on Working Capital. We believe our focus on cost reductions and aggressive management of working capital, are positioning the Company to capitalize on future revenue growth opportunities, irrespective of the economy and school funding levels. In fiscal 2016, several operational improvement initiatives resulted in cost reductions, and greater efficiencies throughout our organization. These initiatives also facilitate effective working capital management and positive cash flow, which provided us with additional resources to invest in key growth areas of our business across both our Distribution and Curriculum business segments. We continue to focus on growing revenues and profits within our Curriculum and Distribution segments by improving both our mix of proprietary products and our operations to enhance the customer experience. We also enjoy a highly predictable working capital cycle, which enables us to effectively manage our capital structure and invest in growth areas of our business and in our infrastructure. 
 Focus on Growth Opportunities through Transformation Initiatives and Partnerships. We believe we have multiple long-term revenue growth and margin improvement opportunities, including enhancing our sales efforts in under-penetrated states, expanding our private-label business, further developing and refining our educational supplies, furniture, technology and curriculum offerings, optimizing direct marketing campaigns, increasing supply chain efficiency and expanding our product line through strategic distribution relationships. We are actively pursuing partnering opportunities for content development and distribution. We also believe our movement toward a team-based selling model will improve the effectiveness of our go-to-market strategies, better inform our product development efforts and better leverage our deep supplier relationships. Additionally, we have and continue to expand our business outside of school districts by pursuing alternative distribution channels, such as e-commerce and health care markets, which we expect will further increase our brand recognition and lead to additional sales opportunities throughout the upcoming fiscal year and beyond. 
 Growth Strategy 
 We have implemented a number of operational changes that have strengthened our operations, lowered our cost structure and improved efficiencies throughout our organization. In fiscal 2016, have realigned our sales, marketing and merchandising organizations to better develop and execute sustainable growth strategies for core product categories or market segments such as early childhood, special needs, physical education, art, furniture, technology, and instructional solutions. Our near-term strategy continues to be focused on the following areas: 

 | Optimizing our Distribution Centers to improve customer delivery both in terms of speed and accuracy and to operate at a lower cost;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Deploying an innovative team-based selling model that increases and enhances the effectiveness of customer touch points and better leverages our deep product and market expertise;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Enhancing product management and marketing capabilities to promote our innovation and breath of offerings and bring new and innovative products to market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continuing to expand alternative channels that have annual purchasing cycles that will lessen our reliance on the heavy back-to-school spending season;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Introducing new and innovative curriculum-based training solutions and incorporating products, services and consulting that address the increased need for school safety and security;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
9 
 

 | Identifying and exiting product lines with inadequate returns, while focusing on higher-margin, growth oriented product lines and categories;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continuing to invest in technologies to improve our customer service capabilities throughout all business areas to improve the customer experience;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continuing to build out our digital solutions and bundled packages, while enhancing our e-commerce platform; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Driving a culture that focuses on accountability and collaboration towards the attainment of our growth and margin improvement objectives.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Companys longer term initiatives are intended to enhance organic growth, improve margins, and better evaluate capital investments and allocation of resources. Among the key initiatives are: 
 

 | Developing multi-year customer retention and growth plans by geography, category and product lines;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Upgrading our IT systems and related technologies to create efficiencies within our organization, streamline processes, and provide insights that will enable us to better service customer needs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Identifying potential acquisition opportunities which would synergistically enhance the revenue and EBITDA of the Company;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Leveraging our breadth of products to expand into new markets and customer segments, and expanding our product offering where appropriate; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Improving communication, both internally and externally to educate all parties on our business operations, product and solution offerings and capabilities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As part of our various initiatives, we are highly focused on generating organic growth within our business, improving our margin structure, lowering our cost basis while making strategic investments in our business and generating higher returns for our stockholders. 
 Organic Growth. We continue our focus on growing revenues and profits from our existing product lines and possible line extensions. We are cautiously optimistic that demand for our products and services will remain stable and, in certain categories, experience modest growth as industry data suggests school spending will increase over the coming years based on continued growth in student population and spending per student.

 Evaluation of Capital Investment and Allocation: We have identified several areas for investment in fiscal 2017 that will strengthen our operations and back-end support, digital and e-commerce platform and solution sets, and overall systems management capabilities. This will be done as part of continuous improvement initiatives that are underway. We are also in the process of major review of all of our product lines and businesses to determine those with unacceptable or inadequate profitability, while simultaneously analyzing the appropriate solutions to maximize our returns, either from disposition or further capital investment. This analysis is to identify both cost saving drivers and new investment opportunities that will strengthen our bottom-line performance both near- and long-term. The Company also intends to continue to analyze acquisition opportunities which may fill product offering gaps and provide improvement in the revenue and EBITDA of the Company.

Product Lines 
 We market our proprietary brands and third-party product assortments across a wide variety of industry categories including general school supplies, arts and crafts, physical education, instructional solutions and special needs, classroom furniture and equipment, outdoor furniture and equipment, technology solutions, and both standards-based and supplemental curriculum solutions. These products are marketed and sold through our two primary business segments: Distribution and Curriculum. 
 Our Distribution offerings are focused in the following areas: 
 Supplies Category: We believe we are the largest marketer of school and classroom supplies into the education market. Through our School Specialty Distribution catalogs, which offer both national brands and many of our proprietary School Smart® products, we provide an extensive offering of basic supplies that are consumed in schools and classrooms as well as in home use. This offering includes office products, classroom supplies, janitorial and sanitation supplies, school equipment, planning and development products, physical education products, art supplies and paper, among others. These products are more commodity-like in nature and require an efficient supply chain and distribution and logistics expertise to be competitive. As a result of our large distribution network and supply chain expertise, our customers view us as a preferred supplier in the Supplies category. Our School Smart private label products are primarily sourced direct from low-cost, overseas manufacturers, which we believe will allow us to enhance our product offering and improve profitability. 
 Our leading market position in the art supplies area of this category is led by Sax® Arts & Crafts, which offers products and programs focused on nurturing creativity and self-expression through hands-on learning. The product line ranges from original cross-curricular lesson plans and teaching resource materials to basic art materials, such as paints, brushes and papers. 
 We also offer a full range of physical education programs, solutions, resources and equipment designed to help improve student and staff wellness. Our products, which are primarily offered under our Sportime® brand, range from traditional sports equipment to unique and innovative products designed to encourage participation by all, as well as research-based teaching materials that foster health and wellness both inside and outside of educational facilities. We also offer proven, research-based physical education and health solutions under our (licensed) SPARK® brand, which is a curriculum and product-based program focused on promoting healthy, active lifestyles and combating childhood obesity. Each SPARK program provides a coordinated package of curriculum, on-site teacher training, and content-matched equipment from our Sportime® product line. The program maximizes physical activity during physical education classes by providing teachers with alternative games, dances and sports that ensure all students are actively engaged and learning. 
 Instructional Solutions: We believe we are one of the largest marketers of educator supplies and related educational materials and technology solutions, as well as instructional learning materials. Our Instructional Solutions category includes supplemental learning materials (reading, math and science), teaching resources, special needs and special education products and early childhood offerings. Innovation, proprietary products, brand strength and direct marketing are key success factors. These product offerings create opportunity for margin enhancement through innovation and unique assortments. 
 We offer several proprietary and innovative instructional solutions and teaching materials to schools and school districts, all designed to help teachers teach and students remain on par with grade-level learning requirements. We also offer a full range of solutions for children with special learning needs through our Abilitations® and Integrations® product lines as well as several third party brands. Our proprietary solutions and products are designed to help educate children with learning, behavioral, sensory or physical differences and are focused on helping educators and therapists make a real difference in a childs life. 
 Our early childhood offering provides educators of young children with products that promote learning and development. Our full-line, highly proprietary offering provides educators with everything from advanced 
 
12 
 
 literacy and dramatic play to manipulatives, and basic arts and crafts. We have several proprietary brands targeting the early childhood market and our flagship brand, Childcraft® is a well-known and trusted brand in the education market. 
 Furniture Category: We believe we are one of the most comprehensive providers of school furniture in the United States, offering a full range of school-specific furniture and equipment, for both in-school, in-classroom and outdoor use. Our offering allows us to equip an entire facility, refurbish a specific location within a school, such as a cafeteria, gymnasium or media center, or to replace individual items such as student desks and chairs. We manufacture award-winning early childhood wood furniture in our Bird-in-Hand® Woodworks facility. We launched a product line of proprietary furniture under our Classroom Select® brand and also provide innovative furniture offerings through our Royal Seating®, Childcraft®, and Korners for Kids® product lines. We are authorized national or regional distributors for leading third-party lines. In addition, we offer our proprietary service, Projects by Design®, which provides turn-key needs assessment and conforming design, budget analysis and project management for new construction projects. 
 Planning and Student Development: We believe we are one of the largest providers of planning and student organization products in the United States and Canada, which is delivered through student agendas and planners. Our offerings are focused on developing better personal, social and organizational skills, as well as serving as an effective tool for students and parents to track and monitor their daily activities, assignments and achievements. Many of our agendas and planners are customized at the school level to include each schools academic, athletic and extra-curricular activities. Our agendas are primarily marketed under the Premier brand name. We are also a leading publisher of school forms, including record books, grade books, teacher planners and other printed forms under the brand name Hammond & StephensTM. 
 A/V Technology: We believe we are among the leading providers of educator-inspired quality audio technology products, including multi-media, audio visual and presentation equipment for the PreK-12 education market. These products are marketed under the brand name Califone®. We also offer a host of other technology solutions under Califone and other third-party brands and are focused on expanding our assortment of products to take advantage of increased investments by schools and school districts in new and emerging technology platforms. 
 SSI GUARDIAN: We believe we have the most comprehensive curriculum-based security initiative designed to keep schools and other facilities safe. Our SSI GUARDIANTM offering is focused on strengthening campus and school safety by providing administrators, teachers and other school personnel with the training and security-related products to address safety and risk mitigation. SSI GUARDIAN also offers consulting services that help schools and school districts conduct vulnerability assessments for school sites, emergency planning, contingency planning, and safe school design. Similar curriculum/training modules have also been developed for health care facilities including hospitals, outpatient care centers and rehab centers.
 Soar Life Products: Leveraging our current product assortment, Soar Life ProductsTM offers thousands of innovative products intended to improve well-being, from early childhood to adults in senior care. The Soar Life offering includes proprietary School Specialty brands, including Childcraft®, Classroom Select®, Sax Arts & Crafts®, Sportime®, Abilitations®, among others, as well as third-party brands. Products span a range of categories and are tailored to address the needs of healthcare organizations, focusing on Arts & Crafts, Physical Activity and Recreational Sports, Furniture, Therapeutic Needs and general supplies, all of which are used by healthcare facilities on a daily basis. Soar Life Products focuses on the healthcare industry, including acute and non-acute settings such as hospitals, long-term care, therapeutic facilities, home care, surgery centers, early childhood and day care centers, physicians offices and clinics, both on a direct basis and through third parties. 
 Our Curriculum offerings are focused in the following areas: 
 Science: Our science product category, largely comprised of highly recognized proprietary or exclusive offerings, provides learning resources focused on promoting scientific education and inquiry, literacy and 
 
13 
 
 achievement to the PreK-12 education market. Our products range from laboratory supplies, equipment and furniture to highly effective hands-on learning curriculums. Our science brands include FOSS® (Full Option Science System), Frey Scientific®, Delta Science ModulesTM, Delta Education®, CPO ScienceTM, and Neo/SCI®. We have structured our solutions to engage students, focusing on science and engineering practices that promote scientific inquiry, literacy and achievements, all while aligning to the Next Generation Science Standards and supporting Common Core State Standards. 
 Science classroom resources offered by Delta Education for example, are focused on the pre-K to 8th-grade education level. Our science curriculum products embody the best in inquiry-based STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education. Delta provides the research-based FOSS® curriculum and other programs such as Delta Science Modules, as well as hands-on classroom resources. FOSS has evolved from a philosophy of teaching and learning at the Lawrence Hall of Science that has guided the development of successful active learning science curricula for more than 40 years. The FOSS program bridges research and practice by providing tools and strategies to engage students and teachers in enduring experiences that lead to a deeper understanding of the natural and designed worlds. Science is a discovery activity, and our belief is that the best way for students to appreciate the scientific enterprise, learn important scientific and engineering concepts, and develop the ability to think well is to actively participate in scientific practices through the use of manipulatives which enhance their own investigations and analyses. The FOSS Program was created specifically to provide students and teachers with meaningful experiences through active participation in scientific practices. 
 At Frey Scientific, we offer a wide selection of science education products, supplemental curriculum, lab equipment and supplies, all of which are a part of STEM solutions that advance effective learning. By working with a network of classroom teachers at various grade levels, we continually seek to understand and adapt to customers needs and Next Generation Science Standards. Our dedicated science education specialists, many with advanced degrees and teaching experience, provide powerful insights that continue to enhance our product line. Frey Scientific elementary, middle and high school education products include supplemental curriculum, Inquiry Investigations® hands-on kits with virtual labs, innovative equipment and precision instrumentation, essential science classroom supplies and laboratory design services and furniture. 
 Literacy & Intervention: Our reading and math intervention and supplemental learning programs, which are standards- and curriculum-based products, are focused on providing educators and parents with effective tools to encourage and enhance literacy and mathematics skills, serving the K-12 grade levels. Educators Publishing Service (EPS) provides tailored reading and language arts instruction for students with special needs and proprietary instructional materials for educators. For over 60 years, EPS Literacy and Intervention has been the leader in developing and publishing programs to help struggling students, including those with dyslexia and other reading difficulties, as well as providing materials that support on-level students so they can continue to meet their educational goals. Today, EPS provides K-12 blended, customized intervention solutions to help at-risk and on-level students build proficiency in reading and math. A variety of programs connect time-tested content and innovation to give educators the power of differentiation to reach all of their students and meet the changing demands of todays classrooms. From screening through to intervention, progress monitoring, reporting and professional development, EPS offers an integrated approach to address the Common Core State Standards and Response to Intervention (RTI). 
 Our products offer reading, math and response to intervention solutions to help K-12 schools close the achievement gap for students who fall below proficiency benchmarks. Our print and technology resources combine to meet the instructional needs of students possessing learning disabilities or who are at risk for reading and math failure. Some of our other innovative teaching materials include Explode the Code®, Making Connections® and Making Connections InterventionTM, Path Driver for Math® and Path Driver for Reading®, Sitton Spelling and WordSkills®, S.P.I.R.E®, and WordlyWise®, among others.

Intellectual Property 
 We maintain a number of patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks and other intangible property rights that we believe have significant value and are important to our business. Our trademarks, trade names and service marks include the following: School Specialty®, Education Essentials®, School Smart®, Royal Seating®, Projects by Design®, Academy of Reading®, Academy of Math®, abc School Supply®, Integrations®, Abilitations®, Brodhead Garrett®, Califone®, Childcraft®, ClassroomDirect®, Frey Scientific®, Hammond & StephensTM, Premier AgendasTM, Sax® Arts & Crafts, Sax® Family & Consumer Sciences, Sportime®, Delta Education®, Neo/SCI®, CPO Science, EPS® and AutoSkill®, SSI GUARDIANTM, and Soar Life ProductsTM. We also sell products under brands we license, such as FOSS®, ThinkMath!, SPARKTM and FranklinCovey® Seven Habits. 
Product Development and Merchandising 
 Our product development managers apply their extensive education industry experience to design instructional solutions, supplemental curriculum and age-specific products to enhance the learning experience. New product ideas are reviewed with customer focus groups and advisory panels comprised of educators to ensure new offerings will be well received and meet an educational need. 
 Our merchandising managers continually review and update the product lines for each business. They determine whether current offerings are attractive to educators and anticipate future demand. The merchandising managers also travel to product fairs and conventions seeking out new product lines. This annual review process results in a continual reshaping and expansion of the educational materials and products we offer. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Product procurement decisions within the education market are generally made at the classroom level by teachers and curriculum specialists and at the district and school levels by administrators. The Company currently has an expansive sales force that sells our products at the classroom, school and district level to educators nationwide. 
 Our Distribution segment sales and marketing approach utilizes a sales force of approximately 300 professionals, approximately 40 distinct catalog titles, and School Specialty Online®, an e-commerce solution that enables us to tailor our product offerings and pricing to individual school districts and school administrators. In fiscal 2016 and short year 2015, we took steps to realign our nationwide sales team and our go-to-market strategy, which also included the expansion of an inside sales team and the implementation of a team-based selling model focused on driving growth through increased customer penetration. 
 In the Supplies category, we leverage our national sales force, which we believe represents the largest distribution network in the market, and our supply chain expertise, to reduce our customers cost of acquisition in the most commonly purchased, highest volume commodity items used by schools. In the Instructional Solution category, we market our products through direct marketing channels and leverage category specific sales personnel. We compete by offering deep assortments in the most commonly purchased products, by leveraging our size to reduce product costs, and by driving customer retention and acquisition through sophisticated database analytics. In the Furniture category, our unique Projects by Design® service gives us significant competitive advantages by providing customers with value-added construction management support, from interior design through installation and field support. In the non-project related segment of furniture, we capitalize on relationship selling through a direct sales force we believe is among the largest in the market. 
 Schools typically purchase educational supplies and supplemental educational products based on established relationships with relatively few vendors. We seek to establish and maintain these critical relationships by 
 
15 
 
 assigning accounts within a specific geographic territory to a territory sales manager who is supported by inside sales, category specialists and a customer service team. The sales managers frequently call on existing customers to ascertain and fulfill their supplemental educational resource and basic supply needs. The customer service representatives maintain contact with these customers throughout the order cycle and assist in order processing. 
 We have a national sales, marketing, distribution and customer service structure. We believe that this structure significantly improves our effectiveness through better sales management, resulting in higher regional penetration and significant cost savings through the reduction of distribution centers. 
 Projects by Design. Projects by Design® is a service we provide our customers free of charge to aid in the design, building and renovation of schools. Our professional designers prepare a detailed analysis of the building and individual classrooms to optimize the layout of student and teacher desks, student lockers and other classroom equipment and fixtures. Customers have the ability to view prospective classrooms through our innovative software in order to efficiently manage the project. We believe this service makes us an attractive alternative to other furniture and school fixture and equipment suppliers. 
 Our Curriculum segment sales and marketing approach utilizes a field sales force of approximately 50 professionals. The sales coverage is nationwide, with the largest student populated states served by a larger contingent of sales professionals. The field and inside sales associates are supported by 10 targeted catalogs and our brand-specific websites to deliver premium educational products to teachers and curriculum specialists. 
 Generally, for each Curriculum product line, a major catalog containing its full product offering is distributed near the end of the calendar year and during the course of the year we mail additional supplemental catalogs. Schools, teachers and curriculum specialists can also access websites for product information and purchasing. Further, we believe that by cross-marketing our Curriculum brands to Distribution customers, we can achieve substantial incremental sales. 
 Internet Operations. Our internet channel activities through www.schoolspecialty.com are focused on enhancing customer loyalty, driving down cost by receiving more orders electronically and creating a customer self-service portal. Our brands are available through our website which allows our customers a single access point for purchasing. Our systems provide functionality to meet the specific needs of school districts and school customers, who generally purchase Distribution products, as well as the needs of individual teachers and curriculum specialists, who tend to buy Curriculum products. Our website allows our customers to manage funding through the use of purchase order spending limits, approval workflows, order management and reporting. In addition, we offer schools and school districts the ability to fully integrate their procurement systems with our website, which gives us another important link to our customers and a significant competitive advantage. It also includes other features that are more helpful to teachers, curriculum specialists and others with more sophisticated online ordering needs, including product search, custom catalogs and email notification, allowing users to have access to the full line of School Specialty products. We have maintained an electronic ordering system for the past 20 years and offer e-commerce solutions directed exclusively at the education market. Each of our Curriculum product lines has a dedicated website for its own products. We also continue to explore expanding our offerings provided through third party internet sources. As such, we have a relationship with Amazon.com under which we offer our propriety branded products through the Amazon.com shopping portal. We believe that this channel allows us to reach educators, consumers and segments of the education space that we did not reach previously. Over the past two years, we have significantly invested in our ecommerce platform to improve website functionality, make the online ordering process easier and faster and improve the overall customer experience, which we believe will help us grow organically. 
 Pricing. Pricing for our Distribution and Curriculum product offerings varies by product and market channel. We generally offer a negotiated discount from catalog or list prices for products from our Distribution catalogs, and respond to quote and bid requests. The pricing structure of proprietary Curriculum products offered through direct marketing is generally less subject to negotiation.

Procurement 
 Non-Proprietary Products. Each year, we add new items to our catalogs and our offerings. We begin to purchase and stock these items before the catalogs are released so that we can immediately satisfy customer demand. We typically purchase under annual supply agreements with our vendors. For our larger vendors we typically negotiate annual contracts that usually provide negotiated pricing and/or extended terms and often include volume discounts and rebate programs. We have exclusive distribution rights on several furniture and equipment lines. 
 Proprietary Products. We develop many proprietary products and generally outsource the manufacturing of these items. 
 Global Sourcing. We are decreasing our product unit costs by consolidating our international supplier network. We are also improving product quality by being very selective in our sourcing relationships. Working in conjunction with our supply partners, we have streamlined our international procurement process, gained real-time visibility, added in-process quality checks, and established new systems and procedures to ensure product safety. 
 Private Label Product. We launched the School Smart® brand in 2005. Since that time we have focused our strategy on providing a private brand alternative for educators, using a combination of off-shoring and out-sourcing of products. In fiscal 2016, our revenue for School Smart branded products was approximately $52 million. We continue to evaluate the balance of branded and private brand products and we believe that there are additional opportunities to grow sales through new products, product line extensions and new product configurations. 
 We maintain close and stable relationships with our vendors to facilitate a streamlined procurement process. At the same time, we continually review alternative supply sources in an effort to improve quality and customer satisfaction and reduce product cost. Increasingly, transactions with our vendors are processed through an electronic procurement process. This electronic process reduces costs and improves accuracy and efficiency in our procurement and fulfillment process. When more than one of our business units buys from the same vendor, we typically negotiate one contract to fully leverage our combined purchasing power. 
 Logistics 
 We believe we have one of the largest and most sophisticated distribution networks among our direct competitors with three fully automated and seamlessly integrated distribution centers, two supporting the Distribution segment and one supporting the Curriculum segment, totaling approximately 1 million square feet of operating space. We believe this network represents a significant competitive advantage, allowing us to reach any school in a fast and efficient fashion. We have enhanced our distribution model, allowing most of our customers to receive their orders of in-stock items within 3 to 5 days, and, through third party strategic relationships, have the ability to offer next-day delivery for many items We utilize a third-party logistics provider in Asia to consolidate inbound shipments of items sourced overseas, lowering our transportation and inventory storage costs. 
 In order to maintain the proprietary nature of certain furniture products, we operate one manufacturing facility. Our Lancaster, Pennsylvania plant manufactures wood furniture for our early childhood offerings. Products that we manufacture accounted for less than 10% of sales during fiscal 2016, the thirty-five week transition period ended December 26, 2015, fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2014. 
 Over the past two years, through a series of initiatives, we have realigned our Distribution Centers and warehouses to efficiently serve the majority of our customers and effectively access key suppliers. We have also invested significantly in lean manufacturing principles and upgraded technology and logistics platforms, which 
 
17 
 
 have strengthened our operational footprint, enabling us to provide better, more accurate and faster shipments to our customers. This remains one of our key corporate priorities. 
 Information Systems 
 We believe that through the utilization of technology for process improvement in areas such as procurement, inventory management, customer order management, order fulfillment, and information management, we are able to offer customers more convenient and cost-effective ways to order products, improve the order fulfillment process to increase on-time and complete performance and effectively focus our sales and marketing strategies. 
 We have implemented a common enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform across all of our businesses. This platform primarily includes software from Oracles E-Business suite. One of the major benefits from the common ERP platform is the consolidation of both product and customer information, which is designed to enhance our ability to execute our sales and marketing strategies. In addition, by utilizing common business systems across the Company, we have improved business processes, reduced cycle time and enhanced integration between the business units. We believe the technologies of the systems will readily support continued growth and integration of our existing businesses. Our distribution centers utilize interfaced warehouse management software to manage orders from our ERP and legacy systems. 
 Competition 
 The supplemental educational products and equipment market is highly fragmented with many retail and wholesale companies providing products and equipment, many of which are family- or employee-owned, regional companies. We also compete, to a much lesser extent, with alternate channel competitors such as office product contract stationers, office supply superstores, purchasing cooperatives and internet-based businesses. Their primary advantages over us include size, location, greater financial resources and purchasing power. Their primary disadvantage is that their product mix typically covers a very small portion of a schools needs (measured by volume). We believe we compete favorably with these companies on the basis of service, product offering and customer reach. The standards-based curriculum market is highly competitive and School Specialty competes with several large, well-known education companies as well as small, niche companies. 
Employees 
 As of February 25, 2017, we had approximately 1,156 full-time employees. Since the beginning of fiscal 2015, we have reduced the number of full-time employees by nearly 300 as we have integrated and aligned core function areas across the Company, such as operations, supply chain management, procurement and logistics, marketing, finance, information technology and human resources. Additionally, to meet the seasonal demands of our customers, we employ many seasonal employees during the late spring and summer months. Historically, we have been able to meet our requirements for seasonal employment. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
Backlog 
 We had no material backlog at December 31, 2016. Our customers typically purchase products on an as-needed basis.
