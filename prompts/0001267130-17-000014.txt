Overview 
We are a leading specialty omni-channel retailer of hunting, fishing, camping, shooting sports, and related outdoor merchandise. Since our founding in 1961, Cabela’s® has become one of the most well-known outdoor recreation brands in the world, and we have long been recognized as the “World’s Foremost Outfitter®.” We believe we offer the widest and most distinctive selection of high-quality outdoor products at competitive prices. We provide a superior quality of service to our customers who are able to access our multiple channels when making a purchase, including retail stores, online, and mobile channels. We supply our customers products through our multi-channel merchandising distribution network consisting of in-store customer pickup or by direct shipment to the customer from one of our distribution centers, retail stores, or vendor drop-ship. We also issue the Cabela’s CLUB® Visa credit card, which serves as our primary customer loyalty rewards program. Cabela’s CLUB plays an integral role in supporting our merchandising business.
Effective the beginning of fiscal year 2016, we realigned our organizational structure and updated our reportable operating segments into two segments - Merchandising and Financial Services. Results of operations for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 have been recast to reflect these new segments and are presented in our “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” presented herein, and in Note 23 “Segment Reporting” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional financial information regarding our Merchandising and Financial Services business segments and on this change in segments see Note 23 “Segment Reporting” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Merchandising Business        
At the end of 2016, we operated 85 retail stores, 74 stores in 36 states and 11 stores in six provinces of Canada. During 2016, we opened eight retail stores, six stores in the United States and two in Canada. The opening of these retail stores increased our total retail square footage to 8.5 million at the end of 2016, up 7% over 2015. 
Our Merchandising segment generated revenue of $3.6 billion in 2016 compared to $3.5 billion in 2015. During 2016, retail store sales totaled $2.8 billion, or 78.3%, of total merchandise revenue and Internet and catalog sales totaled $772 million, or 21.7%, of total merchandise revenue compared to 2015, which consisted of 53 weeks, with retail store sales of $2.7 billion, or 76.4%, and Internet and catalog sales of $823 million, or 23.6 %, of total merchandise revenue. The impact of the 53rd week in 2015 was to increase total revenue and revenue from our Merchandising segment by $84 million.
Retail Store Formats. Our retail store concept is designed to appeal to customers from a broad geographic and demographic range. Our retail stores range in size from 40,000 to 246,000 square feet. We have two basic store formats, one which is our large-format traditional retail stores that were opened in August 2008 and earlier and offer a tourist-type experience. We have 28 of these large-format stores that we refer to as our legacy stores.
 4

Our current store format, with more standardized store sizes, expedites store development time and allows us to pursue the best retail locations, is adaptable to more markets, improves time to market, and allows us to be more efficient in our operations by reducing our capital investment requirements and increasing sales per square foot. We have 57 of these new format stores that range in size from approximately 40,000 to 100,000 square feet. The flexibility in the size of this format allows us to serve both large and small markets with large concentrations of Cabela’s customers.
Retail Store Expansion and Innovation. Our strategy of new store growth is primarily focused on the location of new stores strategically sized to match their markets. We consider the impact of larger market locations with an established competitor as well as the increased competition in urban markets in determining the size of a new store, its location, and the flexibility in its layout to appeal to customers. We believe it is imperative to continue innovating how we select, design, and build our retail stores, while applying best-in-class omni-channel retail practices to improve customer experience and reduce expenses from groundbreaking to grand opening. Ongoing efforts are using learnings from our legacy in destination retail, our extensive internal customer analytics capabilities, and relationships with external partners and industry leaders to triangulate solutions that will satisfy customers and shareholders. The new format stores, on average, generate a higher profit per square foot compared to the legacy store base. We expect that the planned openings of future stores will continue, on average, to generate a higher profit per square foot compared to our legacy store base. The new stores allow us to enter a broader choice of markets with our goal to have a store model that is more predictable in order to maximize sales, margins, cash flows, and an acceptable return on invested capital.
We are currently evaluating store locations and new stores to open beyond 2016, but we plan to open fewer stores than we have in the recent past. As of the date of this filing, we have announced plans to open six new stores located in Gainesville, Virginia; Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada; McDonough, Georgia; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Chesterfield Township, Michigan; and El Paso, Texas. These six new stores will have total retail square footage of approximately 400,000.
Store Locations and Ownership. We own 78 of our 85 retail stores, with 24 stores subject to ground leases. In connection with some of the economic development packages received from state or local governments where our stores are located, we have entered into agreements granting ownership of the taxidermy, diorama, or other portions of our stores to these state and local governments. Refer to Item 2 – “Properties” for additional information on our stores.
Internet and Catalog Business. The Internet and catalog business sells products through our e-commerce websites (Cabelas.com and Cabelas.ca), mobile devices, and print catalog distributions. We believe that mobile marketing and social networking technologies will continue to build our brand, build our customer database, and enhance the management of contacts with our customers. The amount of traffic coming through mobile devices is growing significantly. We continue to improve our customers' digital shopping experiences on Cabelas.com and via mobile devices as we strive to provide a best-in-class level of service to our customers. Our marketing focus continues to be on developing a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers regardless of their transaction channel. Our digital transformation continues with efforts around enhancing our website to support the Internet and catalog business. Cabelas.com and the mobile website run off a single operating platform, allowing us to manage the desktop and mobile sites using one system. Our omni-channel marketing efforts and retail store growth, as well as successes in our social marketing initiatives, are resulting in increased customer engagement across multiple channels and a more consistent experience across all channels. 
Our Cabelas.com website is a cost-effective medium designed to offer a convenient, highly visual, user-friendly, and secure online shopping option for new and existing customers. In addition to the ability to order the same products available in our catalogs, our website gives customers the ability to review product information, purchase gift certificates, research general information on the outdoor lifestyle and outdoor activities, provide product reviews and read product reviews by other customers to assist in making buying decisions, purchase highly specialized merchandise, and choose from other services we provide. Cabelas.com continues to be the most visited website in the sporting goods industry according to Hitwise, Inc., an online measurement company. 
We intend to expand our drop-ship sales program from our 2016 levels through our high traffic website, which will increase the exposure of national brands, provide low risk expansion of product lines, and provide faster distribution of products. Our drop-ship sales program requires no inventory investment and delivers the shopping experience customers trust from Cabela’s.

We have transformed our legacy catalog business into an omni-channel enterprise supporting new emerging digital technologies, e-commerce, and mobile capabilities while optimizing the customer experience with our growing retail footprint. We use our customer database to ensure that customers receive catalogs matching their merchandise preferences and to cross-sell merchandise to existing customers. We use the catalogs to prompt customers to go to retail stores and our website or to our call centers to place orders directly. We have continued to refine our catalog strategy toward specialty catalogs, micro-season catalogs, and smaller catalogs with more seasonal themes or focusing on one specific outdoor activity.
Financial Services Business 
Our Financial Services segment provides customers with a rewards program that enhances revenue, operating profitability, and customer loyalty in our Merchandising segment. Through WFB, our wholly-owned bank subsidiary, we issue and manage the Cabela’s CLUB Visa credit card, a rewards based credit card program. We believe the Cabela’s CLUB Visa credit card loyalty rewards program is an effective vehicle for strengthening our relationships with our customers, enhancing our brand name, and increasing our merchandise revenue. Our rewards program is a simple loyalty program that allows customers to earn points whenever and wherever they use their Cabela’s CLUB Visa credit card and then redeem earned points for products and services through our merchandising business. The percentage of our merchandise sold to customers using the Cabela’s CLUB Visa credit card, including the redemption of points, was 30% for 2016.
WFB is a special purpose Nebraska state-chartered bank, insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), which is limited to issuing only consumer credit cards and certificates of deposit of one hundred thousand dollars or more. During 2016, we had an average of 2,064,517 active credit card accounts with an average balance of $2,480 compared to an average of 1,940,534 active credit card accounts with an average balance of $2,301 during 2015. We define an active credit card account as any account with an outstanding debit or credit balance at the end of any respective month during the past 12 months. 
Cabela’s CLUB Marketing. We have a low cost, efficient, and tailored credit card marketing program that leverages the Cabela’s brand name. We market the Cabela’s CLUB Visa credit card through a number of channels, including retail stores, our website, inbound telemarketing, and our catalogs. Our customers can apply for the Cabela’s CLUB Visa credit card at our retail stores and website through our instant credit process and, if approved, receive reward points available for use on merchandise purchases the same day. When a customer’s application is approved through the retail store instant credit process, the customer’s new credit card is produced and given to the customer immediately thereafter. Maintaining the growth of our credit card program, while continuing to underwrite high-quality customers, actively manage our credit card delinquencies and charge-offs, and provide exclusive experiences is key to the successful performance of our Financial Services segment. The growth of Cabela’s CLUB program is dependent, in part, on the success of our merchandising business to generate additional sales and to attract additional Cabela’s CLUB customers. 
Underwriting and Credit Criteria. We underwrite high-quality credit customers and have historically maintained attractive credit statistics compared to industry averages. The scores of Fair Isaac Corporation (“FICO”) are a widely-used financial metric for assessing a person’s credit rating. Our credit cardholders had a median FICO score of 793 at the end of 2016 compared to 794 at the end of 2015. We believe the median FICO scores of our cardholders are well above the industry average. Our net charge-offs as a percentage of total outstanding balances were 2.35% in 2016, compared to 1.70% in 2015 and 1.69% in 2014. Refer to “Asset Quality of Cabela’s CLUB” for additional information regarding our credit card loan charge-offs and delinquencies on our credit card loans. 
Products and Merchandising    

We offer our customers a comprehensive selection of high-quality, competitively priced, national and regional brand products, including our own Cabela’s brand. Our product assortment includes merchandise and equipment for hunting, fishing, marine use, camping, and recreational sport shooting, along with casual and outdoor apparel and footwear, optics, vehicle accessories, and gifts and home furnishings with an outdoor theme.

The following table sets forth the percentage of our merchandise revenue contributed by major product categories for our Merchandising segment for the last three years. 
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Hunting Equipment | 48.1 | % | | 45.5 | % | 44.3 | %
General Outdoors | 30.9 | | | 31.2 | | 30.3 | 
Clothing and Footwear | 21.0 | | | 23.3 | | 25.4 | 
Total | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

Hunting Equipment. The hunting equipment merchandise category includes a wide variety of firearms, ammunition, optics, archery products, and related accessories and supplies for almost every type of hunting and recreational sport shooting. Our hunting equipment products are supported by in-house services such as gun bore sighting, scope mounting, and bow tuning to serve the complete needs of our customers. 
General Outdoors. The general outdoors merchandise category includes a full range of equipment and accessories supporting all outdoor activities, including all types of fishing and tackle products; a wide selection of boats, electronics, and marine accessories and equipment; camping gear and equipment for various experience levels of outdoor enthusiasts; food preparation and outdoor cooking products; all-terrain vehicles and accessories for automobiles and all-terrain vehicles; and gifts and home furnishings.
Clothing and Footwear. The clothing and footwear merchandise category includes fieldwear apparel and footwear, sportswear apparel and footwear, including technical gear for the active outdoor enthusiast, apparel and footwear for the casual customer, and workwear products.
Cabela’s Branded Products. In addition to national brands, we offer our exclusive Cabela’s branded merchandise. Sales of our branded merchandise are included in the preceding table that shows the percentage of merchandise revenue contributed by major product categories for our Merchandising segment and in total. We have a significant penetration of Cabela’s branded merchandise in casual apparel and footwear as well as in selected hard goods categories such as camping, fishing, and optics. Where possible, we seek to protect our Cabela’s branded products by applying for trademark or patent protection for these products. Our Cabela’s branded products typically generate higher gross profit margins compared to our other branded products. Our Cabela’s branded merchandise accounted for approximately 23% of our merchandise revenue in 2016. By having an appropriate mix of Cabela’s branded and other branded merchandise, we strive to meet the expectations and needs of our customers and expand the recognition of the Cabela’s brand.    
Marketing    
We seek to increase the amount each customer spends on our merchandise through enhanced customer targeting, expanded use of digital marketing channels in mobile marketing and social networking and other technology-based approaches, the development and marketing of new products, and continued focus on specialty catalogs. Our Cabela’s brand platform “It’s In Your Nature,” creates a connection between us and our customers by focusing on our common appreciation for the outdoors. We have taken advantage of web-based technologies such as targeted promotional e-mails, online shopping engines, and Internet affiliate programs to renew efforts in local markets and to increase sales. We also have continued to improve our customer relationship management system, which allows us to better manage our customer relationships and more effectively tailor our marketing programs. We will continue to capture additional customer purchase history and information through retail store growth.    
In addition to the use of our website and our catalogs, we use a combination of promotional events, traditional advertising, and media programs as marketing tools. We engage in certain promotional activities by sponsoring sportsmen and women advocacy groups and wildlife conservation organizations, as well as regional and local events and organizations. We also provide sponsorship of fishing tournaments and other related habitat and wildlife conservation activities. We have historically received extensive local publicity from the unique Cabela’s shopping experience when we open a new store. As we enter into larger metropolitan markets, where the opening of a Cabela’s store may not be major news, we supplement any publicity with additional advertising to increase consumer awareness of new store openings.

Competition 
We compete in a number of large and highly competitive markets, including the outdoor recreation and casual apparel and footwear markets. The outdoor recreation market is comprised of several categories, including hunting, fishing, camping, and wildlife watching, and we believe it crosses over a wide range of geographic and demographic segments. We compete directly or indirectly with other broad-line merchants, large-format sporting goods stores and chains, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, discount and department stores, small specialty retailers, and catalog and Internet-based retailers.
We believe that we compete effectively with our competitors on the basis of our wide and distinctive merchandise selection, our strong credit card loyalty rewards program for our customers, the superior customer service we offer our customers, and the quality associated with the Cabela’s brand, as well as our commitment to understanding and providing merchandise that is relevant to our targeted customer base. We cater to the outdoor enthusiast and the casual customer, and believe we have an appealing and inspiring store environment. We also believe that our omni-channel model enhances our ability to compete by allowing our customers to choose the most convenient medium to interact and transact with us. This model also allows us to reach a broader audience in existing and new markets and to continue to build on our internationally recognized Cabela’s brand.
Customer Service

Since our founding in 1961, we have been deeply committed to serving our customers by selling high-quality products through outfitters who deliver excellent customer service and in-depth product knowledge. We strive to provide superior customer service at the time of sale and after the sale. In order to better serve our customers, we continue focusing our efforts on offering customers integrated opportunities to access and use our retail stores, web and social media channels, and catalogs. Our customers have access to well-trained, friendly, and knowledgeable outfitters to answer product use and merchandise selection questions. We believe our ability to establish and maintain long-term relationships with our customers and encourage repeat visits and purchases is due, in part, to the strength of our customer support, product information, and service operations.
Our omni-channel model employs the same merchandising team, distribution centers, customer database, and infrastructure, which we continue to leverage by building on the strengths of each channel. Customer service venues include in-store pick-up for website orders, in-store Cabela’s website kiosks, and catalog order desks. Our in-store kiosks provide our customers access to our entire inventory assortment, allowing customers to place orders for items that may be out of stock in our retail stores or to purchase items only available on our website. Our in-store pick-up program allows customers to order products through our website and catalogs and have them delivered without incurring shipping costs to the retail store of their choice, which increases traffic to our stores. In addition, our retail stores introduce customers to our website and catalog channels.    
Distribution and Fulfillment    
We operate distribution centers in Sidney, Nebraska; Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin; Wheeling, West Virginia; Tooele, Utah; and Puyallup, Washington. These distribution centers comprise approximately 3.7 million square feet of warehouse space for our retail store replenishment and Internet and catalog business activities. In November 2015, we opened a 98,000 square foot distribution center located in Puyallup, Washington, which is near Tacoma, Washington. This leased facility allowed us to eliminate third party warehousing services on the west coast beginning in January 2016, and to timely prioritize in-bound international freight destined for our inland distribution centers and stores, which has increased our internal service levels and delivered our products throughout our network more efficiently. Our merchandise distribution in Canada is processed by a third-party logistics provider through a leased facility in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
We ship merchandise to our Internet and catalog business customers via United Parcel Service, Federal Express, Canada Post, and the United States Postal Service. We use common carriers and typically deliver inventory two to three times per week for replenishment of our retail stores. We also operate a merchandise return center in Oshkosh, Nebraska.
We have added our retail stores to our distribution network through the omni-channel fulfillment process, so customers who order through our call centers or website are no longer solely dependent upon the stock we have in our distribution centers. We now ship products to our customers from both our distribution centers and our retail stores. In-store pick-up services are also available at our distribution center in Tooele, Utah.

Information Technology Systems    

Our information technology and operational systems are an integral function of our Merchandising and Financial Services business segments. Our information is processed in a secure environment to protect both the physical assets and the actual data from security breaches and cyber attacks. These systems are designed to process customer orders, track customer data and demographics, order, monitor, and maintain sufficient amounts of inventory, facilitate vendor transactions, and provide financial reporting. We continually evaluate, modify, and update our information technology systems supporting our supply chain, including our design, sourcing, merchandise planning, forecasting and purchase order, inventory, distribution, transportation, and price management systems. We continue to make modifications to our technology that will involve updating or replacing certain systems with successor systems, including improvements to our systems for omni-channel merchandise and financial planning, e-commerce, and customer relationship management.
Employees

At the end of 2016, we employed approximately 19,100 employees. We use part-time and temporary workers to supplement our labor force at peak times during our third and fourth quarters. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are party to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Seasonality

We experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenue and operating results. Due to buying patterns around the holidays and the opening of hunting seasons, our merchandise revenue is traditionally higher in the third and fourth quarters than in the first and second quarters, and we typically earn a disproportionate share of our operating income in the fourth quarter. Because of our retail store growth, and fixed costs associated with retail stores, our quarterly operating income may be further impacted by these seasonal fluctuations. We anticipate our sales will continue to be seasonal in nature. Refer to Note 26 “Quarterly Financial Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information by quarter for 2016 and 2015.
Government Regulation    
We are subject to numerous laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matter, including consumer protection, firearms and ammunition, Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and banking regulations. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) may also impact our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future and any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties. 
We pay applicable corporate income, franchise, sales, and other taxes to states where we have physical nexus. As we open more retail stores, we will be subject to tax in an increasing number of state and local taxing jurisdictions.
Intellectual Property    
Cabela’s®, Cabela’s CLUB®, Cabelas.com®, World’s Foremost Outfitter®, World’s Foremost Bank®, and Bargain Cave® are among our registered service marks or trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have numerous pending applications for trademarks. In addition, we own other registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks involving advertising slogans and other names and phrases used in our business. We own certain patents associated with various products. We also own trade secrets, domain names, and copyrights, which have been registered for each of our catalogs.

We believe that our trademarks are valid and valuable and intend to maintain our trademarks and any related registrations. We do not know of any material pending claims of infringement or other challenges to our right to use our marks in the United States or elsewhere. We have no franchises or other concessions which are material to our operations.
