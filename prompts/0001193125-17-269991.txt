We offer cloud solutions, as well as software designed to run on-site at the customers location. The majority of our revenues are derived from offerings sold as SaaS-based solutions and paid for on a subscription and transaction basis. 
 We operate cloud-based settlement networks that facilitate electronic payments and transaction settlement between businesses, their vendors and banks. We offer cloud and on-premise solutions that banks use to provide payment, cash management and treasury capabilities to their business customers, as well as solutions that banks and credit unions use to facilitate customer acquisition and growth. We offer legal spend management solutions that help manage and determine the right amount to pay for legal services and claims vendor expenditures for insurance companies and other large corporate consumers of outside legal services. Our corporate customers rely on our solutions to automate their payment and accounts payable processes and to streamline and manage the production and retention of electronic documents. Our healthcare customers use our solutions to streamline financial processes, particularly the patient enrollment process. We also offer comprehensive cyber fraud and risk management solutions that are designed to non-invasively monitor and analyze user behavior and payment transactions to flag behavioral and data anomalies and other suspicious activity. 
 Our solutions are designed to complement, leverage and extend our customers existing information systems, accounting applications and banking relationships so that they can be deployed quickly and efficiently. To help our customers realize the maximum value from our products and meet their specific business requirements, we also provide professional services for installation, training, consulting and product enhancement.

Our Products and Services 
 Settlement Network Solutions 
 Paymode-X is a cloud-based payment network allowing businesses to easily transition from paper to electronic payments, maximizing cost-savings, efficiency and security. With more than 365,000 member businesses, new Paymode-X customers gain immediate benefits because many of their vendors are already part of the Paymode-X network and can be paid electronically on day one. Our vendor enrollment process leverages our Intelligent Engagement Model which includes predictive analytics tools and proprietary processes designed to maximize vendor adoption. As a comprehensive settlement network, customers can easily optimize working capital and their payment mix by making card, ACH, wire and check payments with a single integrated payment file. We continually invest in features and services that enhance the network value and usability for member businesses, including: electronic payments and remittance delivery, online access to payment detail and reports, online payment approvals, electronic invoice delivery and turnkey vendor enrollment and support. We partner with Visa and Mastercard to offer Paymode-X with card capabilities. 
 Our cloud-based financial messaging solutions leverage the SWIFT global messaging network to allow banks and corporations to exchange financial information including payment instructions, cash reporting and other messages to facilitate transaction settlement with banks and counterparties around the world. Our financial messaging solutions allow banks and corporations to achieve lower costs, rapid implementation, greater security and improved risk management, while avoiding costly internal infrastructure. 
 Digital Banking 
 We offer payments, cash management and online banking solutions to financial institutions, including banks and credit unions. Our solutions enable banks of all sizes to offer their customers a host of capabilities 
 
4 
 
 including ACH and BACS payments, wires, international payments, check production, customer acquisition, balance and information reporting and other features that facilitate enterprise-wide cash management and interaction with their customers. Our web payment fraud module integrates with our cloud-based payments and cash management platforms, providing real time security monitoring and automated transaction blocking for fraudulent activity. Our solutions allow our bank customers to attract and service a full range of client segments from small businesses to multi-nationals. These solutions feature an intuitive user interface designed to simplify all aspects of payments and cash management for customers of all sizes and sophistication, through both browser-based and mobile channels. 
 Legal Spend Management 
 Our cloud-based legal spend management solutions and services integrate with claims management and time and billing systems to automate legal invoice management processes and to provide insight into all areas of a companys outside legal spend. The combination of automated invoice routing and a sophisticated rules engine allows corporate legal and insurance claims departments to create more efficient processes for managing invoices generated by outside law firms and other service providers, while offering insight into important legal spend factors including expense monitoring and outside counsel performance. We continue to expand the capabilities of these offerings to leverage predictive analytics to facilitate the selection and retention of counsel, forecast claim settlement and litigation expense and augment the management and budgeting of litigation matters. 
Cyber Fraud and Risk Management 
 Our cyber fraud and risk management solutions (CFRM) non-invasively monitor, replay and analyze user behavior and payment transactions to flag and even stop suspicious activity in real time. These solutions are highly configurable and create accountability by recording and analyzing each application interaction and screen view, reducing the risk of theft, information leakage, internal fraud and payments fraud, as well as decreasing the cost of regulatory compliance. Case management capabilities centralize risk management, speed investigations, and facilitate compliance with regulations pertaining to Anti Money Laundering (AML), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Know Your Customer (KYC). 
Payment and Document Automation 
 Our payment automation solutions can generate a wide variety of domestic and international payment instructions along with consolidated bank reporting of cash activity. Our web fraud and security module is designed to identify and track fraudulent activity that occurs in a customers platform. Our solutions can reduce administrative expenses and strengthen compliance and anti-fraud controls. Users are able to gather and access data via the web related to payment and bank account information, including account totals and detailed transaction data, providing improved workflow, financial reporting and bank communications. 
 To help augment financial document workflow and delivery, we also offer a number of solutions designed to automate a wide variety of business documents and supply chain processes as well as related web-based delivery and document archive. Our products offer advanced design, output formatting and delivery capabilities to replace paper-based forms, as well as automating the labor-intensive accounts payable processing of invoices. 
 Healthcare Solutions 
 We offer solutions for patient registration, electronic signature, mobile document and payments for healthcare organizations to improve business efficiency, reduce costs and improve care quality. Our solutions are utilized across the acute care hospital enterprise and broader healthcare systems, accelerating the paper-to-electronic transition while helping our customers streamline data flows. 
 We also extend our CFRM platform to provide privacy and data security for healthcare organizations enabling them to better protect themselves and their patients data from the growing threat posed by the misuse of valid user credentials. The use of user behavior analytics, profiling and a risk scoring engine allows healthcare organizations to detect user behavior changes and receive alerts in real-time.

 Our Competition 
 The markets in which we participate are highly competitive. We believe our ability to compete depends on factors within and beyond our control, including: 
 

 | our ability to develop new, innovative technology solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers and the shifting dynamics of the markets we participate in;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | our ability to attract and retain employees with the requisite domain knowledge and technical skill set necessary to develop and support our products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the performance, reliability, features, ease-of-use and price of our offerings as compared to competitor alternatives;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | our industry knowledge and expertise;
--+--------------------------------------


 | the execution of our sales and services organizations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | the timing and market acceptance of new products as well as enhancements to existing products, by us and by our current and future competitors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For our settlement network solutions, our principal competitors include AvidXchange, US Bank Payments Plus and combined card and ACH Solutions from JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, D+H Corporation, Eastnets, SunGard and SWIFT. 
 For our digital banking payments and cash management solutions, we primarily compete with companies such as ACI Worldwide, Fiserv, FIS, Q2, Jack Henry, Backbase, NCR, MeridianLink and Polaris, that offer a wide range of financial services, including electronic banking applications. We also encounter competition in our digital banking customer acquisition offerings from MeridianLink and D+H Corporation. 
 For our legal spend management solutions, we compete with a number of companies, including Wolters Kluwer ELM Solutions, LexisNexis, Mitratech and Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC). 
 For our cyber fraud and risk management products, we primarily compete with NICE Actimize, Norkom-Deitca, SAS, Guardian Analytics and FairWarning. 
 For our healthcare solutions, our primary competitors are Access, FairWarning, FormFast, Iatric Systems and Standard Register. 
 Our payment and document automation products compete primarily with products from companies that provide solutions to create, publish, manage and archive electronic documents and companies that offer payments software and services. Our products also compete with companies that provide a diverse array of 
 
6 
 
 accounts payable automation and workflow capabilities. We also compete with providers of enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions and providers of traditional payment products, including check stock and check printing software and services. In addition, some financial institutions compete with us as outsourced check printing and electronic payment service providers. 
 Although we believe that we compete favorably in each of the markets in which we participate, the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change and a number of factors could adversely affect our ability to compete in the future, including those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Our Segments 
 Operating segments are the components of our business for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer. Our operating segments are generally organized by the type of product or service offered and by geography. 
 Similar operating segments have been aggregated into four reportable segments as follows: 
 Cloud Solutions. Our Cloud Solutions segment provides customers predominately with SaaS technology offerings that facilitate electronic payment, electronic invoicing and spend management. Our legal spend management solutions, which enable customers to create more efficient processes for managing invoices generated by outside law firms while offering insight into important legal spend factors such as expense monitoring and outside counsel performance, are included within this segment. This segment also incorporates our settlement network solutions (financial messaging and Paymode-X). Our settlement network solutions are highly scalable, secure and cost effective and facilitate cash payment and transaction settlement between businesses, their vendors and banks. Revenue within this segment is generally recognized on a subscription or transaction basis or ratably over the estimated life of the customer relationship. 
 Digital Banking. Our Digital Banking segment provides solutions that are specifically designed for banking and financial institution customers. Our Digital Banking products are now sold predominantly on a subscription basis, which has the effect of contributing to recurring subscription and transaction revenue and the revenue predictability of future periods, but which also delays revenue recognition over a longer period. 
 Payments and Transactional Documents. Our Payments and Transactional Documents segment is a supplier of software products that provide a range of financial business process management solutions including making and collecting payments, sending and receiving invoices, and generating and storing business documents. This segment also incorporates our payments automation software for direct debit and receivables management and provides a range of standard professional services and equipment and supplies that complement and enhance our core software products. Revenue associated with the aforementioned products and services is typically recorded upon delivery. This segment also incorporates certain other solutions that are licensed on a subscription basis, revenue for which is typically recorded on a subscription or transaction basis or ratably over the expected life of the customer relationship. 
 Other. Our Other segment consists of our healthcare and cyber fraud and risk management operating segments. Our cyber fraud and risk management solutions non-invasively monitor, replay and analyze user behavior to flag and even stop suspicious activity in real time. Our healthcare solutions for patient registration, electronic signature, mobile document and payments allow healthcare organizations to improve business efficiency, reduce costs and improve care quality. When licensed on a perpetual license basis, revenue for our cyber fraud and risk management and healthcare products is typically recorded upon delivery, with the exception of software maintenance which is normally recorded ratably over a twelve-month period. When products are licensed on a subscription basis, revenue is normally recorded ratably over the subscription period. 
 Periodically a sales person in one operating segment will sell products and services that are typically sold within a different operating segment. In such cases, the transaction is generally recorded by the operating segment to which the sales person is assigned. Accordingly, segment results can include the results of 
 
7 
 
 transactions that have been allocated to a specific segment based on the contributing sales resources, rather than the nature of the product or service. Conversely, a transaction can be recorded by the operating segment primarily responsible for delivery to the customer, even if the sales person is assigned to a different operating segment. 
 Our chief operating decision maker assesses segment performance based on a variety of factors that normally include segment revenue and a segment measure of profit or loss. Each segments measure of profit or loss is on a pre-tax basis and excludes stock compensation expense, acquisition and integration related expenses (including acquisition related contingent consideration), amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, fixed asset charges, restructuring related charges, minimum pension liability adjustments, non-core charges related to our 1.50% convertible senior notes due in December 2017 and our five-year revolving credit facility in the amount of up to $300 million, global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system implementation costs and other non-core or non-recurring gains and losses that arise from time to time. There are no inter-segment sales; accordingly, the measure of segment revenue and profit or loss reflects only revenues from external customers. The costs of certain corporate level expenses, primarily general and administrative expenses, are allocated to our operating segments based on a percentage of the segments revenues. 
 We do not track or assign our assets by operating segment.

Financial Information About Geographic Areas 
 We have presented geographic information about our revenues below. This presentation allocates revenue based on the point of sale, not the location of the customer. Accordingly, we derive revenues from geographic locations based on the location of the customer that would vary from the geographic areas listed here; particularly with respect to financial institution customers located in Australia for which the point of sale was North America and customers located in Africa for which the point of sale was Israel. 

 | Fiscal Year Ended June 30,
 | 2017 | | 2016 | 2015

North America | $ | 221,608 | | 63.5% | $ | 199,765 | 58.2% | $ | 193,286 | 58.4% 
United Kingdom | | 80,421 | | 23.0% | | 96,244 | 28.0% | | 93,735 | 28.3%

Long-lived assets based on geographical location, excluding deferred tax assets and intangible assets, were as follows:

 | 2017 | | 2016 | 
 | (in thousands) | 
Long-lived assets: | | | | | 
North America | $ | 59,800 | | $ | 56,885
United Kingdom | | 8,705 | | | 8,499 
Continental Europe | | 2,449 | | | 1,924 
Asia-Pacific and Middle East | | 2,024 | | | 2,080 
Total long-lived assets | $ | 72,978 | | $ | 69,388

 A significant percentage of our revenues are generated by our international operations and our future growth rates and success are in part dependent on continued growth and success in international markets. As is the case with most international operations, the success and profitability of these operations is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including exchange rate fluctuations. We do not currently hedge against exchange rate fluctuations. A number of other factors could also have a negative effect on our business and results from operations outside the U.S., including different regulatory and industry standards and certification requirements, reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries, import or export licensing requirements, the complexities of foreign tax jurisdictions and difficulties and costs of staffing and managing our foreign operations. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 As of June 30, 2017, we employed 329 sales and marketing employees worldwide, of whom 203 were focused on North American markets, 111 were focused on the United Kingdom and continental Europe markets and 15 were focused on Asia-Pacific and Middle East markets. We market and sell our products directly through our sales force and indirectly through a variety of channel partners and reseller relationships. We market and sell our products domestically and internationally, with an international focus on the United Kingdom and continental Europe. We also maintain an inside sales group which provides a cost effective channel into maintaining existing customers and expanding our customer base. 
Product Development and Engineering 
 Our product development and engineering organization includes employees as well as strategic development partners who provide a flexible supplement to our internal resources. We have three primary development groups: product design and user experience, software engineering, and quality assurance. We expensed $53.0 million, $47.4 million and $47.2 million in product development and engineering costs in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Our product design and user experience team is extensively involved in the design of all of our products, driving the user-centered design process to ensure elegant, engaging and easy-to-use products. Part of this process is user experience testing that is conducted to provide additional productivity gains for the end user. 
 Our software engineers have substantial experience in advanced software development techniques as well as extensive knowledge of the complex processes involved in business document workflow, cash management, payment and invoicing applications. They maintain extensive knowledge of software development trends and best practices. Our technology focuses on providing business solutions utilizing industry standards, providing a path for extendibility and scalability of our products. Security, control and fraud prevention, as well as performance, data management and resource efficiencies are priorities in the technology we develop and deploy. 
 Our quality assurance engineers have extensive knowledge of our products and expertise in software quality assurance techniques. The quality assurance team participates in all phases of our product development 
 
10 
 
 processes. Members of the quality assurance group make use of both manual and automated software testing techniques to ensure high-quality software is being delivered to our customers. The quality assurance group members participate in alpha and beta releases, testing of new product releases and performance and security testing for our products. 
 Backlog 
 At the end of fiscal year 2017, our backlog was $213.2 million, including deferred revenues of $96.2 million. At the end of the fiscal year 2016, our backlog was $215.6 million, including deferred revenues of $93.4 million. We do not believe that backlog is a meaningful indicator of revenues that can be expected for any future period, and there can be no assurance that backlog at any point in time will translate into revenue in any specific subsequent period. 
Proprietary Rights 
 We use a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws to help establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology and products. During fiscal year 2017, we added 4 issued patents to our portfolio. In total, we currently hold 31 U.S. patents as well as 9 foreign equivalent patents in Europe, Israel and India. We expect to receive other patents, as we have 10 applications pending before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The earliest year of expiration of any of our remaining patents is 2019. 
 We intend to continue to file patent applications as we identify patentable technology. There can be no assurance, however, that our existing patent applications, or any others that we may file in the future, will issue or will be of sufficient scope and strength to provide meaningful protection of our technology or any commercial advantage to us, or that the issued patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, we rely upon a combination of copyright and trademark laws and non-disclosure and other intellectual property contractual arrangements to help protect our proprietary rights. Given the rapidly changing nature of the industrys technology, the creative abilities of our development, marketing and service personnel may be as or more important to our competitive position as are the legal protections and rights afforded by patents. We also enter into agreements with our employees and clients that seek to limit and protect our intellectual property and the distribution of proprietary information. However, there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information, and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our proprietary rights. 
 Government Regulation 
 Our U.S. chartered financial institution customers are federally regulated by either the Federal Reserve (FED), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the National Credit Union Association (NCUA) or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Our non U.S. based financial institution customers are normally subject to a similar regulatory oversight within their respective country of domicile. We are subject to periodic examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) interagency in our capacity as a technical financial service provider, during which our operating practices are risk-assessed and compared against applicable laws and regulations. If we, as part of such an examination, were to receive a material unfavorable regulatory rating, our customers may be advised by their direct federal regulators to reassess their commercial relationships with us, including the continued use of our products. 
 Each of our operating segments provides services and/or products that may be subject to various federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, particularly in the area of data security and privacy. These laws and regulations govern the collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information as well as notification requirements in the event of security breaches. The legal and regulatory framework in these areas is complex and continually evolving, particularly with respect to data security, payment technology and payment methodologies. We may become subject to new or increased regulation in the future, and the cost of complying with current or future regulatory requirements could exceed our estimates. Our products and services must be designed to work effectively within this legal framework. 
 
11 
 
Employees 
 As of June 30, 2017, we had approximately 1,600 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we believe that employee relationships are good. Our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly-qualified technical and managerial personnel in a highly competitive market.
