 PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 
 The Company provides a wide range of products for the packaging needs of our customers and is one of the worlds largest producers of high quality pressure sensitive, in-mold and heat transfer labels, and a major manufacturer of glue-applied and shrink sleeve labels. The Company also provides a full complement of print methods including flexographic, lithographic, rotogravure, letterpress and digital, plus in-house pre-press services. 
Pressure Sensitive Labels: 
 Pressure sensitive labels adhere to a surface with pressure. The label typically consists of four elements  a substrate, which may include paper, foil or plastic; an adhesive, which may be permanent or removable; a release coating; and a backing material to protect the adhesive against premature contact with other surfaces. The release coating and protective backing are removed prior to application to the container, exposing the adhesive, and the label is pressed or rolled into place. Innovative features of this product include promotional neckbands, peel-away coupons, resealable labels, see-through window graphics, and holographic foil enhancements to cold and hot foil stamping. 
 The pressure sensitive market is the largest category of the overall label market and represents a significant growth opportunity. Our strategy is to be a premier global supplier of pressure sensitive labels that demand high impact graphics or are otherwise technically challenging. 
 In-Mold Labels (IML): 
 The in-mold label process applies a label to a plastic container as the container is being formed in the mold cavity. The finished IML product is a finely detailed label that performs consistently well for plastic container manufacturers and adds marketing value and product security for consumer product companies. 
 Each component of the IML production process requires a special expertise for success. The components include the substrate (the base material for the label), inks, overcoats, varnishes and adhesives. We are unique in the industry in that we manufacture IMLs on rotogravure, flexographic and lithographic printing presses. There are several critical characteristics of a successful IML: the material needs a proper coefficient of friction so that the finished label is easily and consistently picked up and applied to the blow-molded container, the substrate must be able to hold the labels inks, including metallics and fluorescents, overlay varnishes and adhesives and the material must be able to lay smoothly, without wrinkle or bulge, when applied to a very hot, just molded plastic container that will quickly shrink, along with the label, as its temperature falls. We continually search for alternate substrates to be used in the IML process in order to improve label performance and capabilities as well as to reduce substrate costs. Technical innovations in this area include the use of peel-away IML coupons, scented and holographic labels.

Heat Transfer Labels (HTL): 
 HTL are reverse printed and transferred from a special release liner onto the container using heat and pressure. The labels are a composition of inks and lacquers tailored to the customers specific needs. These labels are printed and then shipped to blow molders and/or contract decorators who transfer the labels to the containers. Once applied, the labels are permanently adhered to the container. The graphics capabilities include fine vignettes, metallic and thermochromatic inks, as well as the patented frost, giving an acid-etch appearance. 
 Therimage is our pioneer heat transfer label technology developed primarily for applications involving plastic containers serving consumer markets in personal care, food and beverage, and home improvement products. The addition of the Clear ADvantage brand provides premium graphics on both glass and plastic containers enabling this decorating technology to achieve the highly sought after no label look for the health and beauty aid, beverage, personal care, household chemical and promotional markets. Our ink only and flameless HTL technology have increased our capabilities in this area. Flameless technology enables us to provide a solution to customers who want to remove open flames from their operations, which are normally required to pre-treat and post-treat containers for Therimage and Clear ADvantage products. Flameless technology has applications in all the aforementioned markets. 
 Glue-Applied Labels (Cut and Stack): 
 Glue-applied labels are adhered to containers using an adhesive applied during the labeling process. Available in roll-fed and sheeted formats, the labels are an attractive and cost-effective choice for high volume applications. These labels can be produced on a wide variety of substrates and accommodate a comprehensive range of embellishments including foil stamping, embossing, metallics and unique varnish finishes. 
 Our innovations within glue-applied labels include peel-away promotional labels, thermochromics, holographics and metalized films. We also offer promotional products such as scratch-off coupons, static-clings and tags. 
 Shrink Sleeve Labels: 
 Shrink sleeve labels are produced in colorful, cutting edge styles and materials. The labels are manufactured as sleeves, slid over glass or plastic bottles and then heated to conform precisely to the contours of the container. The 360-degree label and tamper resistant feature of the label are marketing advantages that many of our customers seek when choosing this label type. 
 The shrink sleeve market is a growing decorating technology as consumer product companies look for ways to differentiate their products. Several markets, such as the beverage market within the consumer goods industry, have adopted this decorating technology. Demand for this label solution in the food and personal care markets continues to grow and should broaden the sales opportunities for shrink sleeve labels. 
 Graphic Services: 
 We provide graphics and pre-press services for our customers at all of our manufacturing locations. These services include the conversion of customer digital files and artwork into proofs, production of print layouts and printing plates, and product mock ups and samples for market research. 
 As a result of these capabilities, we are able to go from concept to printed label, thus increasing our customers speed to market and further enhancing our value proposition. 
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 Our product leadership group focuses on research and development, product commercialization and technical service support. The group includes chemical, packaging and field engineers who are responsible for developing and commercializing innovative label and application solutions. Technical service personnel also assist customers and manufacturers in improving container and label performance. The services provided by this group differentiate us from many of our competitors and drive our selection for the most challenging projects. 
 Our research and development expenditures were $5,274, $5,520 and $4,619 in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 SALES AND MARKETING 
 We provide a complete line of label solutions and a variety of technical and graphic services. Our vision is to be the premier global resource of decorating solutions. We sell to a broad range of consumer product, food & beverage, wine & spirits and healthcare companies located in North, Central and South America, Europe, China, Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Our sales strategy is a consultative selling approach. Our sales organization reviews the requirements of the container and offers a number of alternative decorating methods. Our customers view us as an expert source of materials, methods and technologies with the ability to offer the most cost effective solution. 
 We have continued to make progress in expanding our customer base and portfolio of products, services and manufacturing locations throughout the world. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, sales to major customers (those exceeding 10% of the Companys net revenues in one or more of the periods presented) approximated 17%, 17% and 18%, respectively, of the Companys consolidated net revenues. All of these sales were made to The Procter & Gamble Company. In fiscal 2015, we entered the Irish label market with the acquisition of Multiprint Labels Limited in Dublin, Ireland, which specializes in pressure sensitive labels for the wine & spirits and beverage markets, and New Era Packaging in Drogheda, Ireland, which specializes in labels for the healthcare, pharmaceutical and food industries.

 EMPLOYEES 
 As of March 31, 2017, we had approximately 5,450 employees. Of the total employees, approximately 60 employees are represented by the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers, International Union (USW) A.F.L.-C.I.O. Local 98 in Norwood, Ohio, and the related labor contract expiring in March 2022.

RAW MATERIALS 
 Common to the printing industry, we purchase proprietary products from a number of raw material suppliers. To prevent potential disruptions to our manufacturing facilities, we have developed relationships with more than one supply source for each of our critical raw materials. Our raw material suppliers are major corporations with successful historical performance. Although we intend to prevent any long-term business interruption due to our inability to obtain raw materials, there could be short-term manufacturing disruptions during the customer qualification period for any new raw material source. 
ACQUISITIONS 
 We are continually in pursuit of selective acquisitions that will contribute to our growth. We believe that acquisitions are a method of increasing our presence in existing markets, expanding into new markets, gaining new customers and product offerings and improving operating efficiencies through economies of scale. Through acquisitions, we intend to broaden our revenue stream by expanding our lines of innovative label solutions, offering a variety of technical and graphic services and fulfilling the specific needs and requirements of our customers. The printing and packaging industry is highly fragmented and offers many opportunities for acquisitions.

 COMPETITION 
 We have a large number of competitors in the pressure sensitive and glue-applied label markets and several competitors in each of the IML, shrink sleeve and HTL markets. Some of these competitors in the pressure sensitive and glue-applied label markets have greater financial and other resources than us. The competitors in IML, shrink sleeve and HTL markets are either private companies or subsidiaries of public companies and we cannot assess the financial resources of these organizations. We could be adversely affected should a competitor develop labels similar or technologically superior to our labels. We believe competition is principally dependent upon product performance, service, pricing, technical support and innovation. 
PATENTS AND LICENSES 
 We own a number of patents and patent applications in the U.S., Europe, Australia and South Africa that relate to the products and services we offer to our customers. Although these patents are important to us, we are not dependent upon any one patent. We believe that these patents, collectively, along with our ability to be a single source provider of many packaging needs, provide us with a competitive advantage over our competition. The expiration or unenforceability of any one of our patents would not have a material adverse effect on us. 
REGULATION 
 Our operations are subject to regulation by federal, state and foreign environmental protection agencies. To ensure ongoing compliance with these requirements, we have implemented an internal compliance program. Additionally, we continue to make capital investments to maintain compliance with these environmental regulations and to improve our existing equipment. However, there can be no assurances that these regulations will not require expenditures beyond those that are currently anticipated. 
 In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration regulates the raw materials used in labels for various products. These regulations apply to the consumer product companies for which we produce labels. We use materials specified by the consumer product companies in producing labels.
