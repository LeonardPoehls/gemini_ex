● | 1404 is a technetium-99m labeled small molecule which binds to PSMA and is used as an imaging agent to diagnose and detect localized prostate cancer as well as soft tissue and bone metastases. In December 2017, we completed enrollment in a Phase 3 trial assessing the diagnostic accuracy of 1404 imaging in men with newly-diagnosed or low-grade prostate cancer, whose biopsy indicates a histopathologic Gleason grade of ≤3+4 severity and/or are candidates for active surveillance. The study was designed to evaluate the (i) specificity of 1404 imaging to identify patients without clinically significant prostate cancer and (ii) sensitivity of 1404 to identify patients with clinically significant disease. The Phase 3 study enrolled approximately 450 patients in the U.S. and Canada. We are developing, based on data from our 1404 clinical trials, PSMA computer-assisted diagnostic tools (“PSMA CADx”) that will automate reading of PSMA-targeted SPECT images based on deep learning.

● | PyL (also known as [18F]DCFPyL) is a fluorinated PSMA-targeted Positron Emission Topography (“PET”) imaging agent that enables visualization of both bone and soft tissue metastases to determine the presence or absence of recurrent and/or metastatic prostate cancer. A Phase 2/3 trial is ongoing to assess the diagnostic performance of PyL PET/CT imaging to detect prostate cancer in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic disease. In 2016, we launched PyL Research Access ProgramTM making limited doses of PyL available to researchers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 1095 is a PSMA-targeted Iodine-131 labeled small molecule that is designed to deliver a dose of beta radiation directly to prostate cancer cells with minimal impact on the surrounding healthy tissues. In collaboration with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, a Phase 1 trial is ongoing to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of 1095, as well as define an optimal dose for a Phase 2 trial, in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (“mCRPC”) who have demonstrated tumor avidity to 1095.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | PSMA TTC is a thorium-227 labeled PSMA-targeted antibody therapeutic. The PSMA TTC is designed to deliver a dose of alpha radiation directly to prostate cancer cells with minimal impact on the surrounding healthy tissues. We granted Bayer AS (“Bayer”) exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize products using our PSMA antibody technology in combination with Bayer’s alpha-emitting radionuclides.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | aBSI quantifies the hotspots on bone scans of prostate cancer patients and automatically calculates the bone scan index value, representing the disease burden of prostate cancer shown on the bone scan. This quantifiable and reproducible calculation of the bone scan index value is intended to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer and may have utility in monitoring the course of the disease. aBSI is sold as a standalone software program to FUJIFILM RI Pharma Co., Ltd. (“Fuji”) in Japan.

We continue to consider opportunities for strategic collaborations, out-licenses, and other arrangements with biopharmaceutical companies involving proprietary research, development, clinical and commercialization programs, and may in the future also in-license or acquire additional oncology compounds and/or programs.
 
Clinical Trial Activities
 
For purposes of this report, in general Phase 1 trials are initial evaluations of safety in humans which study mechanism of action and metabolism; Phase 2 trials evaluate safety, dosing and activity or efficacy, and continue safety evaluation; and Phase 3 trials involve larger scale evaluations of safety, efficacy and dosing.
Our practice is and has been to announce commencement and results of all our significant clinical trials in press releases, medical and scientific meetings, and other venues. The following is a summary of current clinical trial activities involving our principal product candidates.
 
AZEDRA. In 2006, a Phase 1 trial was commenced with AZEDRA in 11 patients with malignant, recurrent and/or unresectable pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma and malignant carcinoid tumors to assess the safety, radiation dosimetry, and distribution metabolism of a single imaging dose of this compound. Following completion of this study, two dose-finding studies were conducted to determine a maximum tolerated therapeutic dose, and to assess safety, dosimetry and preliminary efficacy of AZEDRA in 21 patients with malignant, recurrent, and/or unresectable pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma and 15 with high-risk neuroblastoma, respectively.
 
Subsequently, a Phase 2 trial of AZEDRA was commenced under an SPA agreement with the FDA regarding the design of this trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the administration of two therapeutic doses of the compound in patients with malignant, recurrent, and/or unresectable pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. These data supported the filing of an NDA, which was accepted by the FDA on December 29, 2017, and granted Priority Review with an action date of April 30, 2018 under the PDUFA. The final results showed that 17 (25%) of the 68 evaluable patients experienced a 50% or greater reduction of all antihypertensive medication for at least 6 months, achieving the primary endpoint specified in the SPA. Favorable results were observed from a key secondary endpoint, the proportion of patients with overall tumor response as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Of the patients who received at least one AZEDRA therapeutic dose 92.2% achieved partial response or stable disease. Median survival time as of March 10, 2017 was 36.7 months (95% CI 29.9 – 49.1) from first AZEDRA therapeutic dosing in the overall study population, and 48.73 months among patients who received two therapeutic doses, compared to 17.42 months among patients who received only one therapeutic dose. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival were 91.0%, 66.8%, and 51.5% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively, following initial therapeutic dosing. Long term follow-up continues.
 
Of the 74 patients who received any dose of AZEDRA, including an imaging dose, 43.2% of patients reported serious treatment-emergent adverse events (“SAEs”), the most frequently reported of which were hematologic (17.6%) treatment-related events. Other treatment-related SAEs reported by more than one subject included pulmonary embolism (2.7%) and myelodysplastic syndrome (“MDS”) (4.1%). There were two additional related malignancies, one case of acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) (1.4%) and one case of acute lymphocytic leukemia (1.4%). There were two treatment related deaths during long term follow up, one due to MDS and the other due to AML.

1404. We conducted five Phase 1 trials with 1404 in healthy volunteers as well as men with prostate cancer, to establish proof-of-concept and dosimetry, and to assess a simplified kit preparation as compared to multi-step preparation. We then conducted a Phase 2 trial in the U.S. and Europe to assess the safety and ability of 1404 to detect prostate cancer within the prostate gland. Analysis of 1404 SPECT/CT images from this study showed that uptake of 1404 in the lobes of the prostate gland correlated significantly with Gleason score (p<0.0001). No deaths, SAEs, or adverse events (“AEs”) leading to discontinuations occurred during the study. Of the 105 subjects who received a 1404 injection, 4 subjects reported a total of 10 treatment-emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”) with 1 related to 1404 (infusion site extravasation). No discernible trends in hematology, clinical chemistries, vital signs, or physical findings were observed during the study.

Based on results from these studies, a multi-center, open-label Phase 3 trial was initiated in December 2015 to evaluate the (i) specificity of 1404 to detect clinically insignificant prostate cancer and (ii) sensitivity of 1404 to detect clinically significant disease in patients with newly-diagnosed or low-grade prostate cancer, whose biopsy indicates a histopathologic Gleason grade of ≤3+4 severity and/or were candidates for active surveillance (N=approximately 450 patients). In December 2017, we completed enrollment in the Phase 3 trial.
 
PyL. In July 2015, we and the Johns Hopkins University entered into an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement for PyL, pursuant to which we obtained exclusive, worldwide (excluding Australia and New Zealand) rights to develop and commercialize PyL in PET imaging applications. PyL is a clinical-stage fluorinated PSMA-targeted PET imaging agent for prostate cancer. PyL has shown potential for use in identifying metastatic prostate cancer. 
 
In December 2016, we initiated a Phase 2/3 trial to assess the safety and efficacy of PyL in the detection of prostate cancer. In addition to our sponsored studies and clinical trial collaborations we anticipate that PyL’s potential activity will also be explored in investigator sponsored studies at various academic institutions.
 
1095. In February 2017, a Phase 1 clinical trial with 1095 began at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. This Phase 1 open-label, dose-escalation study plans to enroll approximately 30 patients with mCRPC who have demonstrated tumor avidity to 1095. The primary objectives of this study include determination of maximum tolerated dose, safety and tolerability, biodistribution, and efficacy. 
 
EXINI Acquisition Update
 
In November 2015, we concluded a public tender offer (the “Offer”) conducted pursuant to Swedish law to acquire EXINI, which develops advanced imaging analysis tools. As of the end of the offer acceptance period on that date, the Offer had been accepted by shareholders representing a total of 17,794,850 shares, corresponding to 96.81% of the total shares in EXINI. In December 2015, we commenced a judicial process in Sweden for acquiring the remaining shares of EXINI and EXINI was delisted and ceased to be publicly traded effective as of the close of trading on December 4, 2015. On December 8, 2016, a Swedish arbitral tribunal awarded us advanced title to the remaining shares of EXINI and, as of that date, EXINI became a wholly-owned subsidiary with 100% of the voting shares owned by us. In connection with the acquisition of the remaining shares of EXINI, in December 2016, we paid $368 thousand to the minority interest shareholders for the original purchase price and estimated interest, of which a net amount of $15 thousand was returned in 2017.
Research and Development Expenses
 
Research and development is essential to our business. During each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we incurred research and development costs of $42.5 million, $37.6 million, and $28.2 million, respectively. For additional information relating to our research and development expenses, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Research and Development Expenses.
 
License and Other Agreements
 
Oncology
 
In January 2013, we acquired Molecular Insight by purchasing all of its outstanding capital stock for 4,452,593 shares of our common stock in a private transaction. Under the agreement, we also agreed to pay to the former stockholders potential milestones, in cash or our stock at our option, of up to $23.0 million contingent upon achieving specified commercialization events ($8.0 million for the first commercial sale of AZEDRA) and up to $70.0 million contingent upon achieving specified sales targets relating to the acquired company’s products. The timing of any such payments, if any, is highly uncertain. In addition to utilizing our own proprietary technology, we have a number of agreements with owners of intellectual property which we use or believe may be useful in the research, development and commercialization of product candidates, including:

• | A 2012 co-exclusive license agreement with the University of Zurich and the Paul Scherrer Institute for worldwide sublicensable rights to certain intellectual property related to production methodologies relevant to 1404. Under this agreement, we maintain related patent rights and are obligated to pay low single-digit royalties on products using the licensed technology, license maintenance fees creditable against royalties, an annual fee for an option to expand the license’s field of use, and clinical and regulatory milestone payments aggregating to approximately $1.3 million. The agreement may be terminated by the licensors upon certain material defaults by, and automatically terminates upon certain bankruptcy events relating to Molecular Insight, and may be terminated by us on prior written notice.

• | A 2000 exclusive license agreement with The University of Western Ontario for worldwide sublicensable rights to certain intellectual property related to production methodologies relevant to AZEDRA. Under this agreement, we maintain related patent rights and are obligated to pay low single-digit royalties on products using the licensed technology, minimum annual royalties creditable against royalties and clinical and regulatory milestone payments aggregating to approximately $0.3 million. The agreement, which either party may terminate upon certain bankruptcy events or material defaults, continues through the last to expire of the related patent rights.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In August 2015, we entered into an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement for PyL with Johns Hopkins University. PyL, when used in conjunction with high-resolution PET imaging, has shown potential for use in identifying prostate cancer and sites of distant metastasis. Progenics intends to focus the development of PyL with high resolution PET imaging to detect and localize recurrent disease in patients who have experienced a biochemical relapse. Under this agreement, we are obligated to pay milestone payments, low single-digit royalties, patent costs and minimum annual royalties which are creditable against royalties, aggregating to approximately $2.9 million.
In April 2016, we entered into an agreement with a Bayer subsidiary granting Bayer exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize products using our PSMA antibody technology in combination with Bayer’s alpha-emitting radionuclides. Under this agreement, we received an upfront payment of $4.0 million and two milestone payments totaling $3.0 million, and we have the right to receive up to an additional $46.0 million in potential future development milestones and up to $130.0 million in commercialization milestones as well as royalty payments. 
RELISTOR
 
Under the RELISTOR License Agreement, Valeant is responsible for developing and commercializing RELISTOR worldwide, including completing clinical development necessary to support regulatory marketing approvals for potential new indications and formulations, and marketing and selling the product. Valeant is marketing RELISTOR directly through its specialty sales force in the U.S., and outside the U.S. directly through distribution and marketing partners. Under our Agreement with Valeant, we recognized a development milestone payment of $40.0 million upon U.S. marketing approval for subcutaneous RELISTOR in non-cancer pain patients in 2014, and a development milestone payment of $50.0 million for the U.S. marketing approval of an oral formulation of RELISTOR in July 2016. We are also eligible to receive up to $200.0 million of commercialization milestone payments upon achievement of specified U.S. sales targets, including: 

Net Sales Level in any Single Calendar Year | Payment | 
--------------------------------------------+---------+--------
In excess of $100 million | $ | 10,000 
In excess of $150 million | | 15,000 
In excess of $200 million | | 20,000 
In excess of $300 million | | 30,000 
In excess of $750 million | | 50,000 
In excess of $1 billion | | 75,000 
 | $ | 200,000

 
Each commercialization milestone payment is payable one time only, regardless of the number of times the condition is satisfied, and all six payments could be made within the same calendar year. We are also eligible to receive royalties from Valeant and its affiliates based on the following royalty scale: 15% on worldwide net sales up to $100.0 million, 17% on the next $400.0 million in worldwide net sales, and 19% on worldwide net sales over $500.0 million each calendar year, and 60% of any upfront, milestone, reimbursement or other revenue (net of costs of goods sold, as defined, and territory-specific research and development expense reimbursement) Valeant receives from sublicensees outside the U.S.
 
The RELISTOR License Agreement may be terminated by either party upon an uncured material breach or specified bankruptcy events. In addition, Valeant may terminate the RELISTOR License Agreement for unresolved safety or efficacy issues or at its discretion upon specified prior notice at any time, subject to our one-time right to postpone such termination for a specified period of time if we have not successfully transitioned the development and commercialization of the drug despite good faith and diligent efforts. See Risk Factors.

We have licensed to Valeant our exclusive rights to develop and commercialize methylnaltrexone, the active ingredient of RELISTOR, which we in-licensed from the University of Chicago (“UC”). Our agreement with UC provides for an exclusive license to intellectual property in exchange for development and potential commercialization obligations, low single-digit royalties on commercial sales of resulting products and single-digit percentages of milestone and sublicensing revenues, and shared patent policing responsibilities. Under the UC agreement, as amended in connection with our RELISTOR collaborations, all of our royalty payment obligations in the U.S. expired at the end of 2017 and will expire at the end of 2018 outside the U.S. on the approved indications. 
 
Valeant has also entered into license and distribution agreements to expand its sales channels outside of the U.S. for RELISTOR. In January 2016, Valeant entered into a distribution agreement with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, also known as Sobi, for RELISTOR in Western Europe, Russia and Greece. In 2016, we recognized license revenue of $720 thousand for our share of the upfront payment Valeant received from Lupin Limited pursuant to a distribution agreement for RELISTOR in Canada.
 
Patents and Proprietary Technology

Protection of our intellectual property rights is important to our business. We seek U.S. patent protection for many of our inventions, and generally file patent applications in Canada, Japan, European countries that are party to the European Patent Convention, and other countries on a selective basis in order to protect inventions we consider to be important to the development of business in those areas. Generally, patents issued in the U.S. are effective for either (i) 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date, if the application was filed on or after June 8, 1995, or (ii) the longer of 17 years from the date of issue or 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date, if the application was filed prior to that date.
 
In certain instances, the U.S. patent term can be extended up to a maximum of five years to recapture a portion of the term during which FDA regulatory review was being conducted. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law, although most countries provide for patent terms of 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date and allow patent extensions similar to those permitted in the U.S.
 
Patents may not enable us to preclude competitors from commercializing drugs in direct competition with our products, and consequently may not provide us with any meaningful competitive advantage. See Risk Factors. We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position in our product areas. We require our employees, consultants and corporate partners who have access to our proprietary information to sign confidentiality agreements.
 
Information with respect to our current patent portfolio is set forth below.
 
The original patents surrounding the AZEDRA program were licensed from the University of Western Ontario (“UWO”). The patent family directed to processes for making polymer precursors, as well as processes for making the final product, expire in 2018 in the U.S. and Canada. Other licensed patent families from UWO relate to alternative approaches for preparing AZEDRA, which if implemented, would expire in 2024 worldwide. We have pending applications worldwide directed to manufacturing improvements and the resulting compositions which, if issued, would expire in 2035.
 
Owned and in-licensed patents relating to 1404 have expiration ranges of 2020 to 2029; we view as most significant the composition-of-matter patent on the compound, as well as technetium-99 labeled forms, which expire in 2029 worldwide. Patent applications directed to methods of use are pending worldwide, which if issued would expire in 2034.
 
The PyL patent family was licensed from Johns Hopkins University. Patent protection for the composition-of-matter patents on the compound, radiolabeled forms of the compound, as well as methods of use, expire in 2030 in the U.S. Corresponding patent family members are pending or issued worldwide, all expiring in 2029.
 
Company-owned patents relating to 1095 have expiration ranges of 2027 to 2031 in the U.S. We view as most significant the composition-of-matter patent on this compound, as well as radiolabeled forms, which expires in 2027 in the U.S., as well as Europe. Additional U.S. patents are directed to stable compositions and radiolabeling processes which expire in 2030 and 2031, respectively.
We own patents relating to automated detection of bone cancer metastases. The patents on this technology expire in 2028.
 
The intellectual property directed to PSMA antibody comprises co-owned and in-licensed patents. Composition-of-matter patents have expirations of 2022 and 2023 in the U.S. Corresponding foreign counterpart patents will expire 2022. We view all of these patents as significant.

With regard to our RELISTOR-related intellectual property, the composition-of-matter patent for the active ingredient of RELISTOR, methylnaltrexone, has expired. UC, as well as we and our collaborators, have extended the methylnaltrexone patent estate with additional patents and pending patent applications covering various inventions relating to the product. Valeant has listed in the FDA Orange Book eight U.S. patents relating to subcutaneous RELISTOR, which have expiration dates ranging from 2017 to 2030, and eight U.S. patents relating to RELISTOR tablet, which have expiration dates ranging from 2017 to 2031. Four Canadian patents (expiring in 2024 and 2029) have been listed with Health Canada relating to subcutaneous RELISTOR. 
 
We are aware of intellectual property rights held by third parties that relate to products or technologies we are developing. For example, we are aware of others investigating and developing technologies, imaging agents and drug candidates directed toward PSMA or related compounds as well as in the case of methylnaltrexone other peripheral opioid antagonists, and of patents and applications held or filed by others in those areas. The validity of issued patents, patentability of claimed inventions in pending applications and applicability of any of them to our programs are uncertain and subject to change, and patent rights asserted against us could adversely affect our ability to commercialize or collaborate with others on specific products.
 
Research, development, and commercialization of a biopharmaceutical product often require choosing between alternative development and optimization routes at various stages in the development process. Preferred routes depend upon current – and may be affected by subsequent – discoveries and test results and cannot be identified with certainty at the outset. There are numerous third-party patents in fields in which we work, and we may need to obtain license under patents of others in order to pursue a preferred development route of one or more of our product candidates. The need to obtain a license would decrease the ultimate value and profitability of an affected product. If we cannot negotiate such a license, we might have to pursue a less desirable development route or terminate the entire program altogether.
Government Regulation
 
We and our product candidates are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and comparable authorities in other countries. Pharmaceutical regulation currently is a topic of substantial interest in lawmaking and regulatory bodies in the U.S. and internationally, and numerous proposals exist for changes in FDA and non-U.S. regulation of pre-clinical and clinical testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, marketing, export, advertising, promotion and other aspects of biologics, small molecule drugs and medical devices, many of which, if adopted, could significantly alter our business and the current regulatory structure described below. See Risk Factors.
 
FDA Regulation
 
FDA approval, which involves review of scientific, clinical and commercial data, manufacturing processes and facilities, is required before a product candidate may be marketed in the U.S. This process is costly, time consuming and subject to unanticipated delays, and a drug candidate may fail to progress at any point.
 
None of our product candidates other than RELISTOR has received marketing approval from the FDA or any other regulatory authority. The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be approved for marketing in the U.S. generally involves:
 

● | pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to and favorable review by the FDA of an investigational new drug application before clinical trials may begin; 
● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended indication (animal and other nonclinical studies also are typically conducted during each phase of human clinical trials);
● | submission to the FDA of a marketing application; and 
● | FDA review of the marketing application in order to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and effective for its intended uses. 

Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and animal studies to gain preliminary information about a compound’s pharmacology and toxicology and to identify safety problems that would preclude testing in humans. Since product candidates must generally be manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”), pre-clinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA good laboratory practices regulations. Pre-clinical testing is preceded by initial research related to specific molecular targets, synthesis of new chemical entities, assay development and screening for identification and optimization of lead compound(s).

Results of pre-clinical tests are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND which must become effective before clinical trials may commence. The IND submission must include, among other things, a description of the sponsor’s investigational plan; protocols for each planned study; chemistry, manufacturing and control information; pharmacology and toxicology information and a summary of previous human experience with the investigational drug. Unless the FDA objects to, makes comments or raises questions concerning an IND, it becomes effective 30 days following submission, and initial clinical studies may begin. Companies often obtain affirmative FDA approval, however, before beginning such studies. 
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or to individuals under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice requirements under protocols submitted to the FDA that detail, among other things, the objectives of the study, parameters used to monitor safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each clinical study must be conducted under the auspices of an Institutional Review Board, which considers, among other things, ethical factors, safety of human subjects, possible liability of the institution and informed consent disclosure which must be made to participants in the trial.
 
Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap. During Phase 1, when the drug is initially administered to human subjects, the product is tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. Phase 2 involves studies in a limited population to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product for specific, targeted indications, determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
 
When a product candidate is found in Phase 2 evaluation to have an effect and an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 trials are undertaken in order to further evaluate clinical efficacy and test for safety within an expanded population. Safety studies are conducted in accordance with the FDA’s International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines. Phase 2 results do not guarantee a similar outcome in Phase 3 trials. The FDA may suspend clinical trials at any point in this process if it concludes that clinical subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 
An NDA is an application to the FDA to market a new drug. A Biologic License Application (“BLA”) is an application to market a biological product. The new drug or biological product may not be marketed in the U.S. until the FDA has approved the NDA or issued a biologic license. The NDA must contain, among other things, information on chemistry, manufacturing and controls; non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology; human pharmacokinetics and bioavailability; and clinical data. The BLA must contain, among other things, data derived from nonclinical laboratory and clinical studies which demonstrate that the product meets prescribed standards of safety, purity and potency, and a full description of manufacturing methods. Supplemental NDAs (“sNDAs”) are submitted to obtain regulatory approval for additional indications for a previously approved drug, and are reviewed by the FDA in a similar manner.
 
The results of the pre-clinical studies and clinical studies, the chemistry and manufacturing data, and the proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA. The FDA may refuse to accept the application for filing if certain administrative and content criteria are not satisfied, and even after accepting the application for review, the FDA may require additional testing or information before approval of the application, in either case based upon changes in applicable law or FDA policy during the period of product development and FDA regulatory review. The applicant’s analysis of the results of clinical studies is subject to review and interpretation by the FDA, which may differ from the applicant’s analysis, and in any event, the FDA must deny an NDA or BLA if applicable regulatory requirements are not ultimately satisfied. If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may be made subject to various conditions, including post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety of the product, or may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed. Product approvals may also be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 
Orphan Drug, Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy Designations, and Priority Review
 
Other FDA regulations and policies relating to drug approval have implications for certain of our current or future product candidates, particularly AZEDRA. Designation as an Orphan Drug is available under U.S., E.U., and other laws for drug candidates intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, and which if approved are granted a period of market exclusivity, subject to various conditions. Orphan Drug designation does not shorten or otherwise convey any advantage in the regulatory approval process. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an Orphan Drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the U.S. AZEDRA is designated as an Orphan Drug. 
 
In the U.S., Orphan Drug designation entitles a party to certain financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to Orphan Drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity.

In cases where the extent and scope of patent protection for a product is limited, the exclusivity period resulting from Orphan Drug designation may be important in helping products maintain a competitive position. Even if a product obtains Orphan Drug exclusivity, however, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties may be approved for the same condition. Even after an Orphan Drug is approved, the FDA may subsequently approve the same drug with the same active moiety for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.
 
The FDA is also authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These mechanisms for expedited review include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation. AZEDRA has received both fast track and breakthrough therapy designations.
 
The FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
In 2012, as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Improvement Act, a new regulatory scheme was established allowing expedited review of products designated as “breakthrough therapies.” A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
Finally, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
 
Both before and after approval is obtained, a product, its manufacturer and the sponsor of the marketing application for the product are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight. Violations of existing or newly-adopted regulatory requirements at any stage, including the pre-clinical and clinical testing process, the approval process, or thereafter, may result in various adverse consequences, including FDA delay in approving or refusal to approve a product, withdrawal of an approved product from the market or the imposition of criminal penalties against the manufacturer or sponsor. Later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or sponsor, including withdrawal of the product from the market. 
 
Regulation Outside the U.S.

Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a pharmaceutical product by comparable government regulatory authorities abroad must be obtained prior to marketing the product there. The approval procedure varies from country to country, and the time required may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements for regulatory approval by governmental agencies in other countries prior to commercialization of products there can be rigorous, costly and uncertain, and approvals may not be granted on a timely basis or at all.

In E.U. countries, Canada, Australia, and Japan, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the U.S. Regulatory approval in Japan requires that clinical trials of new drugs be conducted in Japanese patients. Depending on the type of drug for which approval is sought, there are currently two potential tracks for marketing approval in E.U. countries: mutual recognition and the centralized procedure. These review mechanisms may ultimately lead to approval in all E.U. countries, but each method grants all participating countries some decision-making authority in product approval. The centralized procedure, which is mandatory for biotechnology derived products, results in a recommendation in all member states, while the E.U. mutual recognition process involves country-by-country approval.
 
In other countries, regulatory requirements may require additional pre-clinical or clinical testing regardless of whether FDA or European approval has been obtained. This is the case in Japan, where trials are required to involve patient populations which we and our other collaborators have not examined in detail. If a product is manufactured in the U.S., it is also subject to FDA and other U.S. export provisions. In most countries outside the U.S., coverage, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required, which may affect the profitability of the affected product.
 
Other Regulation
 
In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA, we are also subject to regulation under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act, Environmental Protection Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and various other current and potential future U.S. federal, state or local regulations. In addition, our research is dependent on maintenance of licenses from various authorities permitting the acquisition, use and storage of quantities of radioactive isotopes that are critical for its manufacture and testing of research products. Biopharmaceutical research and development generally involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, viruses, and various radioactive compounds. Even strict compliance with safety procedures for storing, handling, using and disposing of such materials prescribed by applicable regulations cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contaminations or injury from these materials, which may result in liability for resulting legal and regulatory violations as well as damages. 
Manufacturing
 
Under the RELISTOR License Agreement, Valeant is responsible for the manufacture and supply, at its expense, of all active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) and finished and packaged products for its RELISTOR commercialization efforts, including contracting with contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) for supply of RELISTOR API and subcutaneous and oral finished drug product. 
 
As to our other product candidates, the manufacture of biopharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals is relatively complex and requires significant capital expenditures. As part of our ongoing efforts to manage our development costs and timely execute on our development plans, we rely on third parties for clinical manufacturing. We have engaged third-party CMOs to manufacture API and finished drug products for clinical trial supplies of all of our product candidates, including AZEDRA, 1404, PyL, and 1095. We are in the final stages of establishing manufacturing capacity that we believe will be sufficient to deliver commercial supplies of AZEDRA. We have partnered with third-parties to produce clinical trial supplies of current clinical-stage product candidates, and may in the future undertake such efforts with respect to other assets and programs. As a result, we depend significantly on the availability of high quality CMO services. If we are unable to arrange for satisfactory CMO services, we would need to undertake such responsibilities on our own, resulting in our having to incur additional expenses and potentially delaying the development of our product candidates. See Risk Factors.
 
Commercial Organization
 
We plan to commercialize AZEDRA in the U.S. ourselves, if regulatory approval is obtained, and to seek strategic partnerships to commercialize AZEDRA in other countries. We are building a small commercial organization for our U.S. efforts in preparation of the potential AZEDRA launch.

Competition
 
Competition in the biopharmaceutical industry is intense and characterized by ongoing research and development and technological change. We face competition from many for-profit companies and major universities and research institutions in the U.S. and abroad. We face competition from companies marketing existing products or developing new products for diseases targeted by our technologies. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources, experience in conducting pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals for their products, operating experience, research and development and marketing capabilities and production capabilities than we do. Our products and product candidates under development may not compete successfully with existing products or products under development by other companies, universities and other institutions. Drug manufacturers that are first in the market with a therapeutic for a specific indication generally obtain and maintain a significant competitive advantage over later entrants and therefore, the speed with which industry participants move to develop products, complete clinical trials, approve processes and commercialize products is an important competitive factor.
 
RELISTOR was the first FDA-approved product for any indication involving OIC. We are, however, aware of other approved and marketed products, as well as candidates in pre-clinical or clinical development, that target the side effects of opioid pain therapy. Our principal competitors in the field of OIC include Nektar Therapeutics, in collaboration with AstraZeneca PLC; Cubist Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc.; Mallinckrodt plc, in collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited; Shionogi & Co., in collaboration with Purdue Pharma L.P.; and Mundipharma International Limited. Other prescription, as well as over-the-counter, laxatives are also used as first line for OIC. 
 
As to our oncology pipeline, radiation and surgery are two traditional forms of treatment for prostate cancer. If the disease spreads, hormone (androgen) suppression therapy is often used to slow the cancer’s progression, but this form of treatment can eventually become ineffective. We are aware of several competitors who are developing or have received approval for treatments for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Our principal competitors in the field of mCRPC include Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Janssen Biotech, Inc.; Pfizer, Inc. in collaboration with Astellas Pharma US, Inc.; and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. Our principal competitors in the field of PSMA-targeted imaging agents include Aytu Bioscience Inc., Blue Earth Diagnostic, Inc. and Novartis AG.
 
There are currently no approved anticancer treatments in the U.S. for malignant, recurrent, and/or unresectable pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. 
 
A significant amount of research in the biopharmaceutical field is carried out at academic and government institutions. An element of our research and development strategy has been to in-license technology and product candidates from academic and government institutions. These institutions are sensitive to the commercial value of their findings and pursue patent protection and negotiate licensing arrangements to collect royalties for use of technology they develop. They may also market competitive commercial products on their own or in collaboration with competitors and compete with us in recruiting highly qualified scientific personnel, which may result in increased costs or decreased availability of technology or product candidates from these institutions to other industry participants.
 
Competition with respect to our technologies and products is based on, among other things, product efficacy, safety, reliability, method of administration, availability, price and clinical benefit relative to cost; timing and scope of regulatory approval; sales, marketing and manufacturing capabilities; collaborator capabilities; insurance and other reimbursement coverage; and patent protection. Competitive position in our industry also depends on a participant’s ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes, and secure sufficient capital resources for the typically substantial period between technological conception and commercial sales.
 
Product Liability
 
The testing, manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates and products involves an inherent risk of product liability attributable to unwanted and potentially serious health effects. To the extent we elect to test, manufacture or market product candidates and products independently, we bear the risk of product liability directly. We maintain product liability insurance coverage in amounts and pursuant to terms and conditions customary for our industry, scale, and the nature of our activities. Where local statutory requirements exceed the limits of our existing insurance or local policies of insurance are required, we maintain additional clinical trial liability insurance to meet these requirements. This insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations. The availability and cost of maintaining insurance may change over time.
Human Resources
 
At December 31, 2017, we had 64 full-time employees, 12 of whom hold Ph.D./PharmD degrees and 3 of whom hold M.D. degrees. At that date, 43 employees were engaged in research and development, medical, regulatory affairs, and manufacturing related activities and 21 were engaged in finance, legal, administration, commercial, and business development. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. None of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
