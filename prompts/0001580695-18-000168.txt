ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
------------------------------------+---------

Company History
 
We were incorporated on April 19, 2004, and for much or our history were engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. We shifted our focus during 2014 and are now an intellectual property company that owns patented and unpatented intellectual property. On August 28, 2014, we changed our name to MV Portfolios, Inc.
The MVP Acquisition 
 
During 2014, we acquired 8 issued and 11 pending patents. The patents disclose systems and methods for providing video drive-by data to enable a street level view of a neighborhood surrounding a geographic location. The systems include, generally, a video and data server farm incorporating at least one video storage server that stores video image files containing video driver-by data corresponding to a geographic location, a data base server that processes a data query received from a user over the internet and an image processing server.
 
On February 7, 2014, we entered into a securities exchange agreement (the “Securities Exchange Agreement”) with MVP Portfolio, LLC (“MVP”), MV Patents, LLC (“MV PAT”), and the other members of MVP (MV PAT and such other members, the “Members”). Pursuant to the terms of the Securities Exchange Agreement, the Members sold all of their membership interests in MVP to us in exchange for 9,385,000 shares (the “MVP Exchange Shares”) of our post-Reverse Split (defined below) common stock to be issued following completion of the Reverse Split. As a result of the MVP Acquisition, we acquired the business of MVP, that is, patent licensing and assertion of rights under patents against parties believed to be selling goods or services that rely upon MVP’s patented technology.
 
For a detailed discussion of the MVP Acquisition and the related transactions, reference is made to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 10, 2014, as amended.
 
For financial reporting purposes, the MVP Acquisition is being accounted for as a “reverse merger” rather than a business combination, because the managing member of MV PAT, the majority member of MVP, effectively controlled the Company immediately following the closing of the MVP Acquisition. As such, MVP is deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction and, consequently, the transaction is being treated as a reverse acquisition of the Company by MVP. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that will be reflected in the Company’s ongoing financial statements will be those of MVP. For periods prior to the formation of MVP (July 26, 2013), MV PAT would be deemed the accounting acquirer.
 
The parties have taken all actions with respect to the Securities Exchange intending that it be treated as a tax-free exchange under Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. It is expected that the $625,000 in cash consideration paid to MV PAT will be treated as taxable income to MV PAT.
 
Description of MVP’s Business
 
MV Portfolios, Inc. (“MVP”) is in the business of productizing inventions. MVP employees and consultants have actively contacted University Offices of Technology Licensing to review their inventory of existing patents and provisional filings available for license. If a patent or patent application appears to have commercial value once productized, MVP will invest to complete a more robust search for prior art. Once the prior art process in completed, MVP will contract with the University or patent owner to obtain an option for exclusive rights for a 6 to 12 month period. Once an option right is established, MVP will research the market and develop a business plan for angel investors.
 
During the 2016 and 2017 fiscal years, MVP primarily focused on supporting LocatorX, Inc. (“LocatorX”) and its mission of productizing the Solid-state Miniature Atomic Clock invented at the University of Oxford.
 
In September 2016, MVPI created a new subsidiary (1st Rescue, Inc.) focused on the patent pending method and apparatus for location tracking of emergency events and delivering instant Tele-MedKits via drones.
 
MVP management also explored other patentable inventions for productization that may be complementary to LocatorX and 1stRescue.
 
MVP management made minimal investments of time and funds to support the Visual Real Estate, Inc. portfolios of patents.
 
MVP provides a variety of operational services to its subsidiaries for its early stage subsidiaries. MVP has intercompany transfer agreements for services provided as well as intercompany loans.

LocatorX, Inc. 
 
MVPI currently has a non-controlling interest in LocatorX. MVPI currently owns 10,000,000 shares of voting common stock, representing 15% of the issued and outstanding voting common and preferred stock on a fully diluted basis. As of June 30, 2017, MVPI currently has advances of $549,619 to LocatorX. The advances have an interest rate of 6% with no due date (payable on demand by LocatorX). Pursuant to the agreement entered into between LocatorX and MVPI in connection with the advances, MVPI has secured and provided financing and equity for the capitalization of the LocatorX for start-up operations.
 
Following a series of transactions and capital contributions that occurred up to and including June 30, 2017, MVPI no longer held a controlling financial interest in its previously consolidated affiliate, LocatorX, Inc. Accordingly, the results of operations of LocatorX, Inc. were consolidated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements up to June 30, 2017. The Company held an 87% equity interest in LocatorX, Inc. at June 30, 2016. The Company accounts for this retained interest under the cost method for investments.
 
Mr. Meadow has voting control of LocatorX, Inc. via Series A Preferred Stock and is the chief executive officer of LocatorX, Inc. and MV Portfolios, Inc.
 
LocatorX is developing and licensing a suite of innovative, secure location tracking technologies to solve fundamental problems in logistics for indoor tracking where GPS does not work. The company was formed when it exclusively licensed a molecular patent for a Solid-state Miniature Atomic Clock, or SMAC, based on work at the nanomaterials lab at the University of Oxford. Conventional atomic clocks are used in GPS satellites to precisely measure distance. Once fully developed, LocatorX believes its SMAC, which is based on a man-made molecule, will enable precise indoor self location determination by listening to existing terrestrial radio towers. To differentiate from GPS, LocatorX’s technologies will be marketed under the GRL brand. A Global Resource Locator.
 
Concurrently, LocatorX is developing a suite of App & Cloud software tools to enable future strategic licensing partners to easily implement our patented Global Resource Locator (GRL) technologies. These involve proprietary Definable Blockchain logs in Bluetooth chips for product labels, Cassandra based cloud based transaction processing, Android / iOS App Software Development Kits for secure communication to encrypted Bluetooth chips as well as 2D barcodes on product packaging. LocatorX believes manufacturers will be able to implement its technologies in their products and packaging to provide new and valuable data to users while at the same time minimizing the brand damaging impact of counterfeit goods. According to GS1.org the cost of counterfeiting is between $1,220 billion to $1,770 billion per year. If LocatorX is able to successfully develop its technology, it anticipates its first licensees will be major manufacturers who are currently subject to high volumes of counterfeit products and software companies who develop products in several markets including packaging, logistics and consumer marketing.
 
LocatorX believes it can build a brand that consumers and corporations can trust across multiple industries and product offerings by incorporating hardware based encryption and Blockchain event log tracking into its patent license agreements. With the installed base of cell towers for billions of smartphones, LocatorX believes its SMAC technology will enable “self-location” anywhere in the world. GRL enabled products will know when they are within an owner’s geo-fence, obeying accordingly in terms of what data is transmitted or not. GRL enabled products will include on-chip Blockchain logging of all “transactions” from creation and packaging through delivery. Once fully developed, LocatorX believes this will provide a guarantee of product authenticity and quality that is automatic, transparent, informative, and trustworthy.
 
1st Rescue Business
 
1st Rescue, Inc. business plan is developing software and leveraging existing drone hardware to rapidly deliver Tele-MedKits from fire stations to emergency events. Sudden Cardiac Arrest is the number one life-threatening emergency event in the world, and accelerating the delivery of a Tele-MedKit with an Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) to residential locations will save many lives. Only an AED can restart a heart. CPR only adds a few minutes of survival time, and an AED is required to shock the heart into pumping on its own. When a heart stops pumping, the medical rule of thumb is that each 1 minute delay increases risk of death by 10%. First responders traveling by ambulance take an average 8.5 minutes to arrive at a victim’s location.
 
If 1stRescue is able to develop its software, 1stRescue anticipates it will contract with large strategic licensing partners who currently provide Computer Aided Dispatch systems to 911 Emergency Command Centers. 1stRescue plans to a software company with some custom designed hardware. Our software is expected to include first responder apps; geospatial, video, biotelemetry servers; and cloud services.
 
If 1stRescue is able to develop its software, 1st Rescue drones are expected to be manufactured, marketed, installed, and supported by our drone manufacturing partners, which would take responsibility for installing and maintaining flight operations. The company is evaluating proven industrial cargo drone manufacturers who would use one of their slightly modified existing production units to lease or sell their drones to the municipalities. The Tele-MedKits would be manufactured and supported by a medical device systems integration partner who will provide essential global logistics support.
 
Other Business
 
On November 20, 2014, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Flexine, Inc., to explore productization potential from a patent from Harvard University for a novel material that may be used to create a unique variable focus lens for SmartPhone cameras. The Company had since discovered competitive technologies that obtained significant venture capital funding and decided to not exercise its option to license the Harvard patent.

Competition
 
We expect to encounter significant competition in our new lines of business from others seeking to commercialize, acquire, license and develop their intellectual property assets. Most of our competitors have much longer operating histories, and significantly greater financial and human resources, than we do. Entities such as Document Security Systems, Inc., Vringo, Inc., VirnetX Holding Corp., Acacia Research Corporation, Allied Security Trust, Altitude Capital Partners, Augme Technologies Inc., Intellectual Ventures, Ocean Tomo, RPX Corporation, Rembrandt IP Management and others presently market themselves as being in the business of creating, acquiring, licensing or leveraging the value of intellectual property assets. We expect others to enter the market. In addition, competitors may seek to acquire the same or similar patents and technologies that we may seek to acquire, making it more difficult for us to realize the value of our assets which may be the result of the inability or unwillingness of third parties to also grant licenses to parties without the cooperation of the owners of other infringed rights.
Research and Development Expenditures
 
We have incurred no research and development expenditures over the last fiscal year and do not anticipate significant future research and development expenditures.
 
Employees
 
We currently have three employees, our Chief Executive Officer, William D. Meadow, our Chief Financial Officer, Shea Ralph, and an Executive Administrator and one consultant.
 
Offices
 
Our principal offices are located at 10752 Deerwood Park Blvd. Suite 100 Jacksonville FL 32256, phone (904)-903-4504. Our website address is www.mvportfolios.com. The information on or accessible through our website is not part of this report.
Intellectual Property and Patent Rights
 
We actively reach out to targeted universities to identify patented and patentable technologies to commercialize. We are focused on productizing innovations where the patent protection is strong. We invest in the portfolio to create additional IP including complementary patents and software with the goal of creating recurring revenue businesses.
 
Our largest portfolio is owned by our subsidiary LocatorX which is commercializing innovative location tracking technologies using “pharmaceutical grade” molecular patents of the Solid-state Miniature Atomic Clock. We have invested in the IP portfolio to create Global Resource Locator chips and secure asset tracking software and cloud services.
