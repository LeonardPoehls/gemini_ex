Luby’s, Inc. (formerly, Luby’s Cafeterias, Inc.) was founded in 1947 in San Antonio, Texas. The Company was originally incorporated in Texas in 1959, with nine cafeterias in various locations, under the name Cafeterias, Inc. It became a publicly held corporation in 1973, and became listed on the NYSE in 1982.
Luby’s, Inc. was reincorporated in Delaware on December 31, 1991 and was restructured into a holding company on February 1, 1997, at which time all of the operating assets were transferred to Luby’s Restaurants Limited Partnership, a Texas limited partnership composed of two wholly owned, indirect subsidiaries. On July 9, 2010, Luby’s Restaurants Limited Partnership was converted into LFR. All restaurant operations are conducted by LFR.

On July 26, 2010, we, through our subsidiary, LFR, completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Fuddruckers, Inc., Magic Brands, LLC and certain of their affiliates (collectively, “Fuddruckers”) for approximately $63.1 million in cash. LFR also assumed certain of Fuddruckers’ obligations, real estate leases and contracts. Upon the completion of the acquisition, LFR became the owner and operator of 56 Fuddruckers locations and three Koo Koo Roo Chicken Bistro locations with franchisees operating an additional 130 Fuddruckers locations.

On December 6, 2012, we completed the acquisition of all of the Membership Units of Paradise Restaurant Group, LLC and certain of their affiliates, collectively known as Cheeseburger in Paradise, for approximately $10.3 million in cash plus customary working capital adjustments. We assumed certain of Cheeseburger in Paradise obligations, real estate leases and contracts and became the owners of 23 full service Cheeseburger in Paradise restaurants located in 14 states.

On August 27, 2014, the Company completed an internal restructuring of certain affiliates of the Luby’s Cafeteria business, whereby these companies were merged with and into LFR, as the successor. The principal purpose of these events was to simplify the Luby’s corporate structure. Following these events, the Company’s restaurant operations continue to be conducted by LFR and Paradise Cheeseburger, LLC. Our operating restaurant locations remain unchanged by these events.

Luby’s Cafeteria Operations

At Luby’s Cafeterias, our mission is to serve our guests convenient, great tasting meals in a friendly environment that makes everyone feel welcome and at home. We do things The Luby’s Way, which means we cook in small batches from scratch using real food, real ingredients prepared fresh daily, and our employees and our company get involved and support the fabric of our local communities. We buy local produce as much as possible. We promise to breathe life into the experience of dining out and make every meal meaningful. We were founded in San Antonio, Texas in 1947.

Our cafeteria food delivery model allows customers to select freshly-prepared items from our serving line including entrées, vegetables, salads, desserts, breads and beverages before transporting their selected items on serving trays to a table or booth of their choice in the dining area. Each restaurant offers 15 to 22 entrées, 12 to 14 vegetable dishes, 8 to 10 salads, and 10 to 12 varieties of desserts daily.

Luby’s Cafeteria’s product offerings are home-style made-from-scratch favorites priced to appeal to a broad range of customers, including those customers that focus on fast wholesome choices, quality, variety, and affordability. We have had particular success among families with children, shoppers, travelers, seniors, and business people looking for a quick, freshly prepared meal at a fair price. All of our restaurants sell food-to-go orders which comprise approximately 13% of our Luby's Cafeteria restaurant sales.

Menus are reviewed periodically and new offerings and seasonal food preferences are regularly incorporated. Each restaurant is operated as a separate unit under the control of a general manager who has responsibility for day-to-day operations, including food production and personnel employment and supervision. Restaurants generally have a staff led by a general manager, an associate manager and assistant managers. We grant authority to our restaurant managers to direct the daily operations of their stores and, in turn, we compensate them on the basis of their performance. Each general manager is supervised by an area leader. Each area leader is responsible for approximately 7 to 10 units, depending on the area supervised.

In fiscal 2018, we closed four Luby's Cafeterias. The number of Luby’s Cafeterias was 84 at fiscal year-end 2018.

Fuddruckers

At Fuddruckers, our mission is to serve the World’s Greatest Hamburgers® using only 100% fresh, never frozen, all American premium beef, buns baked daily in our kitchens, and the freshest, highest quality ingredients on our “you top it” produce bar. With a focus on excellent food, attentive guest service and an inviting atmosphere, we are committed to making every guest happy, one burger at a time! Fuddruckers restaurants feature casual, welcoming dining areas where Americana-themed décor is featured. Fuddruckers was founded in San Antonio, Texas in 1980.

While Fuddruckers’ signature burgers and fries account for the majority of its restaurant sales, its menu also includes exotic burgers, such as buffalo and elk, chicken breast sandwiches, hot dogs, a variety of salads, chicken tenders, hand breaded onion rings, soft drinks, handmade milkshakes, and bakery items. A variety of over 100 carbonated soft drinks including our own unique Sweet Cherry Cream Soda, which is exclusively offered at Fuddruckers restaurants, along with other varieties such as Powerade®, and flavored waters are offered through Coke Freestyle® self-service dispensers. Additionally, beer and wine are served and, generally, account for less than 2% of restaurant sales. Food-to-go sales comprise approximately 8% of Fuddruckers restaurant sales.

Restaurants generally have one general manager with two or three assistant managers and a number of full-time and part-time associates working in overlapping shifts. Since Fuddruckers generally utilizes a self-service concept, similar to fast casual, it typically does not employ waiters or waitresses. Fuddruckers restaurant operations are currently divided into a total of ten geographic areas, each supervised by an area leader. On average, each area leader supervises five to nine restaurants.

In fiscal 2018, we closed 11 Company-owned Fuddruckers restaurants. The number of Fuddruckers restaurants was 60 at fiscal year-end 2018.

Cheeseburger in Paradise

Cheeseburger in Paradise is known for its inviting beach-party atmosphere, its big, juicy burgers, salads, coastal fare, and other tasty and unique items. Cheeseburger in Paradise is a full-service island-themed restaurant and bar developed in collaboration with legendary entertainer Jimmy Buffet based on one of his most popular songs. The restaurants also feature a unique tropical-themed island bar with many televisions and tasty “boat drinks.” As of our fiscal year-end 2018, we operated two of the original Cheeseburger in Paradise locations.
Culinary Contract Services

Our CCS segment consists of a business line servicing long-term acute care hospitals, acute care medical centers, ambulatory surgical centers, retail grocery stores, behavioral hospitals, sports stadiums, senior living facilities, government, and business and industry clients. The healthcare accounts are full service and typically include in-room delivery, catering, vending, coffee service, and retail dining. Our mission is to re-define the contract food industry by providing tasty and healthy menus with customized solutions for healthcare, senior living, business and industry and higher education facilities. We seek to provide the quality of a restaurant dining experience in an institutional setting. At fiscal year-end 2018, we had contracts with 11 long-term acute care hospitals, seven acute care hospitals, three business and industry clients, three sport stadiums, one governmental facility, one medical office building, one senior living facility, and one freestanding coffee venue located inside an office building. We have the unique ability to deliver quality services that include facility design and procurement as well as nutrition and branded food services to our clients. 
Franchising

Fuddruckers offers franchises in markets where it deems expansion to be advantageous to the development of the Fuddruckers concept and system of restaurants. A standard franchise agreement generally has an initial term of 20 years. Franchise agreements typically grant franchisees an exclusive territorial license to operate a single restaurant within a specified area, usually a four-mile radius surrounding the franchised restaurant. Luby’s management will continue developing its relationships with our franchisees over the coming years and beyond.

Franchisees bear all direct costs involved in the development, construction and operation of their restaurants. In exchange for a franchise fee, we provide franchise assistance in the following areas: site selection, prototypical architectural plans, interior and exterior design and layout, training, marketing and sales techniques, assistance by a Fuddruckers “opening team” at the time a franchised restaurant opens, and operations and accounting guidelines set forth in various policies and procedures manuals.

9

All franchisees are required to operate their restaurants in accordance with Fuddruckers standards and specifications, including controls over menu items, food quality and preparation. We require the successful completion of our training program by a minimum of three managers for each franchised restaurant. In addition, franchised restaurants are evaluated regularly for compliance with franchise agreements, including standards and specifications through the use of periodic, unannounced on-site inspections, and standards evaluation reports.

The number of franchised restaurants was 105 at fiscal year-end 2018 and 113 at fiscal year-end 2017.

For additional information regarding our business segments, please read Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Strategic Focus
Our strategic focus is to generate consistent and sustainable same-store sales growth and improved store level profit. We want our company’s performance to make it a leader wherever it operates and in its sector of our industry. We strive to provide attractive returns on shareholder capital. From an operating standpoint, we support this strategic focus through the following: 

1. | Consistently successful execution: Every day, with every guest, at every restaurant we operate.


2. | Growing our human capital: Our team members are the most critical factor in ensuring our Company’s success. Our relentless focus as a company must be inspiring and developing our team members to delight our guests. 


3. | Raising awareness of our brand: Our restaurants provide guests in our local communities with memories of family, friends, childhood, a great date, a memorable birthday, or a significant accomplishment. The most reliable ways to grow and sustain our business is to perpetuate word of mouth and remain involved in the community. We must share our story with our guests in our restaurants. This allows new guests to learn our brand story and also reaffirms it with legacy and loyal guests. Loyal guests spread and preach the word about our brand. Our most loyal guests typically agree to be in our E-club so we can communicate with them and reward them.


4. | Improving restaurant appearances: We recognize the importance of remodeling our legacy restaurants to remain relevant and appealing to keep loyal guests coming back and draw in new guests.


5. | Effective cost management: We evaluate each area of our business to assess that we are spending and investing at appropriate levels. This includes restaurant operating costs and corporate overhead costs. Within our restaurants, we seek opportunities with our food and supplies purchasing, menu offerings, labor productivity, and contracts with restaurant service providers to maintain an appropriate restaurant level cost structure. Within our corporate overhead, we seek opportunities to leverage technology and efficient work processes to maintain a stream-lined corporate overhead. 

We remain focused on the key drivers of our businesses to achieve operational excellence of our brands and to efficiently manage costs to grow profitability and enhance shareholder value.

The success of our business depends on the continued ability to use existing trademarks, service marks, and other components of our brands in order to increase brand awareness and further develop branded products.
