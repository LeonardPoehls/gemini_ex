Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
Endurance Specialty Holdings Ltd. ("Endurance Holdings") is a holding company headquartered in Bermuda. Through our operating subsidiaries based in Bermuda, the United States and the United Kingdom, we underwrite property and casualty insurance and reinsurance on a global basis. We focus on the underwriting of specialty lines of insurance and reinsurance, which require dedicated, specialized underwriting skills and resources in order to be profitably underwritten. Our operations are organized into two business segments – Insurance and Reinsurance.
We began operations in December 2001 after Endurance Specialty Insurance Ltd. completed a private placement of $1.2 billion of its equity securities. Endurance Holdings was incorporated in Bermuda in June 2002. On March 5, 2003, Endurance Holdings completed the initial public offering of its ordinary shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "ENH". On July 31, 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of Montpelier Re Holdings Ltd. ("Montpelier"), a Bermuda based provider of global property and casualty reinsurance and insurance products. As part of the acquisition, we acquired Montpelier's Lloyd's of London operations, including Syndicate 5151 ("Syndicate 5151") and its managing agent, Endurance at Lloyd's Limited ("Endurance at Lloyd's"). Also as part of the acquisition, we acquired Montpelier's collateralized reinsurance and third party asset management operations, operating under the name "Blue Capital", which includes Blue Capital Management Ltd. ("BCML"), a wholly-owned subsidiary that provides investment and insurance management services to the Blue Capital vehicles through business written in Blue Water Re Ltd. ("Blue Water Re") and Blue Water Re II Ltd. ("Blue Water Re II"), wholly-owned special purpose insurers. 
On October 5, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger Agreement") for the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding ordinary shares of the Company by Sompo for $93.00 per share in cash (the "Merger"). The Merger has been approved by each company's Board of Directors and the Company's ordinary and preferred shareholders at a special general meeting. The Merger is expected to close as soon as practicable following the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including, but not limited to, regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance that the Merger will occur. 
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the aggregate consideration for the Merger will be approximately $6,304.0 million in cash. The purchase will be financed by Sompo from existing sources of liquidity and supplementary facilities. If the Merger is terminated under certain circumstances, the Company is obligated to pay Sompo a cash termination fee of $204.9 million together with Sompo's expenses related to the Merger up to $15.8 million. The Company is contractually obligated to pay investment banking fees upon the closing of the Merger. 
Endurance Holdings' nine wholly-owned operating subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 are as follows:

• | Endurance Specialty Insurance Ltd. ("Endurance Bermuda"), domiciled in Bermuda with branch offices in Switzerland and Singapore;


• | Blue Capital Management Ltd. ("BCML"), domiciled in Bermuda, and manager of Blue Water Re and Blue Water Re II, also domiciled in Bermuda;

BUSINESS STRATEGY
Our goal is to generate superior value and long-term return on capital for our shareholders as a leading globally diversified specialty insurance and reinsurance company. We believe the substantial investments we have made to increase the scale of the Company, expand our global underwriting talent and product capabilities, improve our risk management, coupled with our ongoing expense discipline and risk management focus, uniquely positions us to achieve this goal.
The key strategies we employ are:

• | Create and continually refine a portfolio of specialty lines of business focused on profitability. We participate in specific specialty lines of insurance and reinsurance that we believe have the potential to offer the highest risk-adjusted return on capital and in which we can establish a competitive advantage through our specialized teams of expert underwriters. We underwrite our business with a focus on its underlying profitability and are committed to expanding or contracting our businesses based upon the opportunities presented in the markets in which we participate.


• | Develop and maintain deep relationships with clients and distribution partners, while utilizing specialized levels of expertise and analysis in our underwriting. Our management team and underwriters have extensive industry experience, long standing market relationships, and are specialists in the business lines in which they operate. We supplement our underwriters' knowledge and experience through the utilization of catastrophe modeling and dynamic financial analysis techniques that provide a quantitative basis for the management of our risk aggregation and correlation.


• | Employ strong risk management practices, including the purchase of reinsurance and retrocessional protection. Our enterprise risk management framework includes sophisticated modeling technology and a detailed internal control structure that we use to manage the underwriting, investment and operational risks across the Company in order to maximize risk adjusted returns on capital. We also purchase reinsurance and retrocessional protection in order to manage our exposure to large individual risk losses and portfolio loss accumulations, to ensure our businesses are of sufficient size to be considered a lead market for their products and to reduce the overall potential for volatility.


• | Enhance shareholder value by managing a portfolio of investments designed to generate net investment income and book value growth. We manage our investment portfolio within a risk adjusted, total return framework. We focus on implementing a portfolio management strategy designed to generate investment income and increase book value by outperforming the financial markets on a risk adjusted basis while ensuring that we have adequate liquidity to satisfy the needs of our clients, regulators, rating agencies and shareholders.


• | Proactively manage our capital base. We proactively manage our capital by allocating resources to underwriting and investment opportunities that we believe will offer the highest risk-adjusted return. We will return capital to our shareholders when the demand for our products declines and when we believe a return of capital would be beneficial to our shareholders. The primary focus of our capital management activities is to optimize our risk adjusted return on equity while ensuring we maintain sufficient levels of risk based capital and financial flexibility as required by our clients, regulators and rating agencies.

DISTRIBUTION
Our business is obtained either directly by the Company or through the use of intermediaries, including independent agents and insurance and reinsurance brokers around the world. The brokerage distribution channel provides us with access to an efficient, variable cost, and global distribution system without the significant time and expense that would be incurred in creating wholly-owned distribution networks.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. was the largest single broker in both our Insurance and Reinsurance segments. A breakdown of our distribution by broker and by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is provided in the tables below:

CLAIMS MANAGEMENT
Claims are managed by our experienced, technical claims teams working closely with each of our operating subsidiaries. Our claims staff reviews and responds to initial loss reports, administers claims databases, identifies and handles coverage issues, determines whether further investigation is required and where appropriate, retains outside claims counsel, establishes case reserves, approves claims for payment, manages salvage and subrogation and notifies reinsurers. In addition, our claims staff conducts audits of our significant clients throughout the year, evaluating claims handling abilities, reserve philosophies, loss notification processes and the overall quality of our clients' performance.
Upon receipt, claims notices are recorded by the claims staff within our underwriting, financial and claims systems. When we are notified of insured losses or discover potential losses as part of our claims audits, claims personnel record a case reserve as appropriate for the estimated amount of the exposure at that time. The estimate reflects the judgment of our claims personnel based on general reserving practices, the experience and knowledge of such personnel regarding the nature of the specific claim and, where appropriate, advice of outside counsel. Reserves are also established to provide for the estimated expense of settling claims, including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process.
RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSES
We are required by applicable laws and regulations and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") to establish reserves for losses and loss expenses that arise from our business. These reserves are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and loss expenses for insured or reinsured claims that have been incurred at or before the balance sheet date, whether already known to us or not yet reported. It is our policy to establish these losses and loss expense reserves after evaluating all information known to us as of the valuation date.
We use statistical and actuarial methods to make a reasonable estimate of ultimate expected losses and loss expenses. The period of time from the reporting of a loss to us and the settlement of our liability may be many years. During this period, additional facts and trends may be revealed. As these factors become apparent, estimated reserves will be adjusted, sometimes 
8

requiring an increase or decrease in our overall reserves, and at other times requiring a reallocation of incurred but not reported reserves to specific case reserves.
Reserves for losses and loss expenses are based in part upon the estimation of losses resulting from catastrophic events. Estimation of losses from catastrophic events is inherently difficult because of the infrequency and severity of large catastrophes. Therefore, we utilize commercially available models, historical reinsurance industry property catastrophe claims experience and other data and estimates provided by our clients to supplement our own historical claims experience for purposes of evaluating future trends and providing an estimate of ultimate claims costs on large catastrophes.
To assist us in establishing appropriate reserves for losses and loss expenses, we analyze a significant amount of insurance industry information with respect to the pricing environment, loss trends, and loss settlement patterns. In combination with our individual pricing analyses, this industry information is used to guide our loss and loss expense estimates. These estimates are reviewed regularly, and adjustments, if any, are recorded in earnings in the periods in which they are determined.
While management believes it has made a reasonable estimate of ultimate losses, there can be no assurance that our future losses and loss expenses will not exceed our current total reserves. For a description of the Company's current reserves, please refer to Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Reserve for Losses and Loss Expenses" and Note 6, "Reserve for losses and loss expenses" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company.
ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT
We have established processes and controls to monitor and manage our risk exposures. Our enterprise risk management ("ERM") activities are led by our Chief Risk Officer and Group Actuary and are critical to the organization's sustained profitability and financial integrity. The goals of our ERM framework that drive our corporate risk management strategy are as follows:

• | identify, assess, measure, monitor and manage the risks that threaten us and our solvency;


• | optimize our risk based capital position;


• | maximize our risk adjusted returns on capital;


• | manage underwriting, investment and operational volatility; and


• | clearly communicate our approach to our employees and external constituencies.

Our ERM framework is rooted in our risk appetite and a system of governance with responsibilities for identifying, managing, monitoring and taking risk. Our risk appetite, as authorized by our Board of Directors, represents the risk that we are willing to accept. We employ a system of quantitative risk limits of our key risks both on an aggregate and stand-alone basis to provide transparency and understanding of our risk profile. To support our governance we use documented risk policies which articulate roles and responsibilities for risk management throughout the organization, including assigning key risks from our risk register and associated controls to our various governance committees.
On a group basis, we monitor our:-

• | Capital position relative to internal requirements, as measured by our economic capital model, and the requirements of our regulators and rating agencies;


• | Underwriting risk exposure relative to limits for loss arising from catastrophic natural peril and man made events;


• | Reserve risk through our exposure to medium and long tailed lines of business;


• | Investment risk, through a system of limits incorporating exposure to asset class, credit rating, duration and currency;


• | Liquidity, by stressing cash outflow scenarios relative to available cash and cash equivalents and other forms of liquidity; and


• | Counterparty exposure nominally and to loss scenarios for ceded reinsurance and for non-reinsurance counterparties.

The following sections more specifically address our method and procedures for addressing and managing our primary risk exposure areas of underwriting, catastrophe, loss reserving, investment, counterparty and operational risks.

Underwriting Risk Management
Internal underwriting controls are established by our Chief Risk Officer and Group Actuary and the Management Risk Committee, which includes our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Executive Officers of Global Insurance and Global Reinsurance. Underwriting authority is delegated to the managers of our lines of business in each business segment and to underwriters in accordance with corporate risk tolerances, prudent practice and underwriting capabilities. Detailed letters of authority are issued to each of our underwriters. These letters of authority reference our operating guidelines and a description of the analytic process to be followed. The letters of authority include, as appropriate, referral requirements specific to each line of business, terms, conditions, risk exposures, transactional situations, limits and premium capacity. Our pricing guidelines are communicated to all business units and each individual underwriter and are stated in terms of maximum combined ratio targets and minimum returns on risk based capital, by line of business, with exceptions permitted only upon approval of senior management as noted in the guidelines.
Our pricing guidelines are regularly reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Executive Officers of Global Insurance and Global Reinsurance, and Chief Risk Officer and Group Actuary in order to ensure the guidelines reflect changes in market conditions, interest rates, capital requirements and market-expected returns. In addition, oversight of underwriting risk management is provided by our Board of Directors and its Risk Committee. For a further discussion on the role of our Board of Directors in the Company's risk management, see "Role of the Board of Directors in Risk Management" below.
We have a disciplined approach to underwriting and risk management that relies heavily upon the collective underwriting expertise of our management and staff. This expertise is in turn guided by the following underwriting principles:

• | we will underwrite and accept only those risks we know and understand;


• | we establish pricing parameters, set our own independent pricing and conduct a risk review on risks we accept; and


• | we generally accept those risks that are expected to earn a return on capital commensurate with the risk they present.

Before we review any natural catastrophe exposed insurance or reinsurance proposal, we consider the appropriateness of the client, including the quality of its management and its risk management strategy. In addition, we prefer those proposals that include significant information on the nature of the perils to be underwritten and detailed aggregate information as to the location or locations of the risks covered. We further request information on the client's loss history for the perils being insured or reinsured, together with relevant underwriting considerations. If a proposal meets the preceding underwriting criteria, we then evaluate the proposal in terms of its risk/reward profile to assess the adequacy of the proposed pricing and its potential impact on our overall return on capital as well as our corporate risk objectives and tolerances.
We have fully integrated our internal pricing actuarial staff into the underwriting and decision making process. We use in-depth actuarial and risk analyses to evaluate contracts prior to authorization. In addition to internal actuaries and risk professionals, we make use of outside consultants as necessary to develop appropriate analyses for pricing.
Separate from our natural catastrophe exposed businesses, we underwrite and accept property, casualty and specialty insurance and reinsurance business. We perform actuarial and risk analysis on these businesses using commercial data and models. As with our natural catastrophe exposed businesses, we seek to identify those casualty and specialty exposures that are most likely to be simultaneously influenced by significant events. These exposures are then jointly tracked to ensure that we do not develop an excessive accumulation of exposure to that particular type of event.
In addition to the above technical and analytical practices, our underwriters use a variety of tools, including specific contract terms, to manage our exposure to loss. These include occurrence limits, aggregate limits, reinstatement provisions and loss ratio caps. Additionally, our underwriters use appropriate exclusions and terms and conditions to further eliminate particular risks or exposures that our underwriting team deems to be outside of the intent of the coverage we are willing to offer. Our Bermuda underwriting location provides us with a particular advantage for certain lines of business because there are no regulatory limitations upon our use of coverage restrictions in insurance policies.
In our crop insurance business, we have invested in an experienced team of professionals who have developed proprietary tools to manage risk, pricing and exposure in this business. These proprietary tools are constructed from databases that involve a comprehensive set of historical profit and loss experience data developed at a crop, farm, county and state level of detail. We further analyze this data based on current and forecasted crop growing conditions, agriculture commodity prices and market conditions in an effort to produce attractive returns.
In certain cases, the insurance and reinsurance risks written and assumed by the Company are partially reinsured with third party reinsurers. The amount of reinsurance protection varies by segment and line of business based on a number of factors, including market conditions. The benefits of reinsuring our risks include reducing exposure on individual risks, improving the balance of the Company's portfolio, protecting against catastrophic risks, maintaining acceptable capital ratios 
10

and enabling the writing of additional business. Reinsurance ceded does not legally discharge the Company from its liabilities to the original policyholder in respect of the risk being reinsured. For more information on the Company's reinsurance ceded, please see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Ceded Reinsurance" and Note 7, "Reinsurance" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company.
Catastrophe Risk Management
To achieve our catastrophe risk management objectives, we utilize a variety of proprietary and commercially available tools to quantify and monitor the various risks we accept.
Our catastrophe modeling tools, which include both proprietary and licensed software, use exposure data provided by our insureds and ceding company clients to simulate catastrophic losses. We take an active role in the evaluation of a commercial catastrophe model, providing feedback to the modeling company to improve the effectiveness of their model. We use modeling not just for the underwriting of individual transactions but also to optimize the total return and manage the aggregate risk of our underwriting portfolio. We have specific requirements as to the quality and levels of detailed exposure data to be provided by our clients and have an expressed preference for data at the zip code or postal code level or finer. Data provided at more summary levels, such as counties or Catastrophe Risk Evaluation and Standardizing Target Accumulations (CRESTA) zones, is surcharged for increased uncertainty, where appropriate. We decline business in which we believe the data provided is insufficient to make an appropriate analysis.
Data output from the software described above is incorporated in our proprietary models. Our proprietary systems include those for modeling a variety of insurance and reinsurance risks including those associated with property, catastrophe, agriculture, and other specialty risks, various casualty and specialty pricing models, as well as our proprietary portfolio risk management and capital allocation models. These systems allow us to monitor our pricing and risks on a contract by contract basis in our segments and business lines.
Data output from both our licensed and proprietary software models is used to estimate the amount of premium that is required to pay the long-term expected losses under the proposed contracts. The data output is also used to estimate correlation between both new business and our existing portfolio. The degree of correlation is used to estimate the incremental capital required to support our participation on each proposed risk, allowing us to calculate a return on consumed capital. Finally, the data output is used to monitor and control our cumulative exposure to individual perils across all of our businesses.
Our pricing of catastrophe reinsurance contracts is based on a combination of modeled loss estimates, actual ceding company loss history, charges for potential unmodeled exposures, fixed and variable expense estimates and profit requirements. The profit requirements are based on incremental capital usage estimates described above and on our required return on consumed capital.
Loss Reserving Risk Management
Establishing reserves for losses and loss expenses, in particular reserves for the Company's long-tail lines of business, constitutes a significant risk for the Company. Loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead are estimates of what the Company expects the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost. To the extent the Company determines that losses and loss expenses are estimated to exceed the loss reserves recorded in our financial statements, the Company will be required to increase its reserve for losses and loss expenses, which in turn could cause a material reduction in the Company's profitability and capital.
The Company manages the risk inherent in estimating the Company's reserves for losses and loss expenses in a variety of ways. First, the Company underwrites a balanced and diversified portfolio of business, which reduces the Company's susceptibility to reserving errors that may be associated with any one line or type of business. Second, where loss development uncertainty exists, the Company may use purchased reinsurance to reduce the Company's exposure to such loss development uncertainty. Finally, in the Reinsurance segment, the Company conducts active, regular audits of its ceding company clients with the intent of quickly and thoroughly identifying losses assumed by the Company.
The Company’s reserving process also serves to mitigate the risk associated with the Company's loss and loss expense reserve estimates. The Company seeks to base its loss reserve estimates upon actuarial and statistical projections derived from the most recently available data, as well as current information on future trends in claims severity and frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. The Company continually refines both its loss reserve estimates and the means by which its loss reserve estimates are derived, continually integrating developing loss experience, reported claims and claims settlements.

Investment Risk Management
Investment risk encompasses the risk of loss in the Company's investment portfolio potentially caused by the adverse impact on its invested assets from fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads, foreign currency rates, inflation and other market changes.
The Company manages its investment risks through both a system of limits and a strategy to optimize expected risk and reward. To ensure diversification of the Company's investment portfolio and to avoid excessive aggregation of risks, limits on asset types, economic sector exposure, industry exposure and individual security exposure are placed on the Company's investment portfolio and monitored on an ongoing basis. The Company manages its interest rate risk through an asset liability management strategy that involves the selection of investments with appropriate characteristics, such as duration, yield, currency and liquidity that are tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our liabilities and the anticipated interest rate environment. The Company manages foreign currency risk by seeking to match the Company's liabilities under insurance and reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with assets, such as cash and investments or currency options and forwards, that are denominated in such currencies. In order to limit the Company's exposure to credit risk, the Company's Investment Policy is to invest primarily in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit exposure to any one issuer. The Company's Investment Policy sets limits for individual credit exposures based on credit rating. The Company manages equity risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio and limiting the overall size of its investment in equities.
The Company uses a number of capital-at-risk models, which include scenario based analysis, value-at-risk ("VaR") and credit impairment calculations to evaluate its investment portfolio risk. Additionally, the Company's capital-at-risk models also include the measures of risk capital applied by Standard & Poor's ("S&P") and A.M. Best Company ("A.M. Best") in their risk based capital assessments of the Company. Scenario-based analytics are used in order to stress test the portfolio for expected changes in specific market scenarios. VaR is a probabilistic method of measuring the potential loss in portfolio value over a given time period and for a given distribution of historical returns. Portfolio risk, as measured by VaR, is affected by four primary risk factors: asset concentration, asset volatility, asset correlation and systematic risk. The Company adjusts its investment risk scenarios for a variety of extremes as well as expected outcomes. Management continuously evaluates the applicability and relevance of the models used and makes adjustments as necessary to reflect actual market conditions and performance over time.
Counterparty Risk Management
Counterparty risk encompasses risk that a counterparty will not uphold its contractual obligations. The Company’s counterparty risk arises mainly from external ceded reinsurance, and the reinsurer’s ability to pay liabilities due. 
The Company mitigates this risk through the management’s Ceded Reinsurance Committee, which is responsible for ensuring that the Company’s underwriting strategy is properly balanced with the Company’s risk tolerance strategy. This is achieved through the determination, at a group level and in conjunction with group risk management, of all underwriting limits and tolerances, which are then promulgated down to the individual entities. 
The purchase of ceded reinsurance is coordinated by the Ceded Reinsurance Officer who works with the business and various functional areas to determine coverage needs, develop an appropriate reinsurance structure and build the submission to present to market. All draft contracts undergo a legal review. The reinsurance also undergoes a risk transfer analysis based on final terms and conditions. All purchases are made through a pre-approved counterparty panel with the constituents selected on the basis of their financial strength rating and other background criteria. In the event of credit downgrades, approved counterparties are removed from the panel. The ceded reinsurance function formally advises the claims and finance functions of all in-force ceded reinsurance treaties to ensure that appropriate recoveries are obtained and reinsurance cessions are properly recorded.
Operational Risk Management
Operational risk represents the risk of loss as a result of inadequate or failed internal processes, system failures, human error or external events. Operational risks include, for example, employee or third party fraud, business interruptions, inaccurate processing of transactions, information technology failures, the loss of key employees without appropriate successors, and non-compliance with reporting obligations.
The Company seeks to mitigate operational risks through ongoing training and the application of strong process controls throughout its business. Key process controls include underwriting letters of authority, underwriting referral protocols, claims procedures guidelines, financial reporting controls and procedures, information technology procedures, succession planning, disaster recovery planning and business continuity planning. The Company's internal audit department tests the Company's policies and various process controls on a regular basis.
12

The use by the Company of the services of unaffiliated third parties exposes the Company to heightened operational risks, including the risk of information technology and physical security breaches, fraud, non-compliance with laws, regulations or internal guidelines and inadequate service to its clients. The Company mitigates the operational risk posed by the use of third party vendors by verifying, among other items, a potential third party vendor’s financial stability, ability to provide ongoing service, business continuity planning and its business reputation as well as monitoring any significant third party relationships.
Role of the Board of Directors in Risk Management
The Company's Board of Directors administers its risk oversight of the Company through quarterly meetings of its Risk Committee with members of senior management, including representatives from the risk management, actuarial, claims, finance, internal audit, investment, legal and underwriting functions within the organization. The Risk Committee's members review with senior management the Company's enterprise risk management framework and risk register as well as related policies, processes and procedures and reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities.
The Risk Committee reviews with management and monitors the Company's risk tolerances as well as the methods utilized by the Company to assess, quantify, monitor and manage these risks. The Risk Committee also evaluates the Company's business plans, projections and performance relative to the level of risk associated with such plans, projections and performance. The Risk Committee reviews and approves on a periodic basis:

• | the Company’s framework for the assessment and management of risk, including the definition of applicable categories of risk, standards in relation to each category of risk and the appropriate risk tolerances;


• | the policies and guidelines governing the Company's framework for the assessment and management of risk; and


• | the level of risk assumed by the Company in its underwriting, investment and operational activities, including the methods by which such risk is measured.

INVESTMENTS
We follow an investment strategy designed to protect book value and generate appropriate risk adjusted returns to grow book value, while providing sufficient liquidity to meet our operating cash needs. The investment portfolio is designed to diversify risks, including interest rate, credit, structure and equity risks. Our investment portfolio is managed by our Chief Investment Officer and a team of investment professionals. Our investment team is experienced in direct portfolio management, asset allocation, managing external investment manager relationships and risk management. Our investment team uses specialized analytical tools to evaluate risk and opportunity in investments to facilitate a risk managed, opportunity oriented approach to investing consistent with the requirements of our Investment Policy. We utilize external portfolio managers to oversee most of the day-to-day activities of our investment portfolio, and our investment professionals actively monitor our investment managers' performance and compliance with our Investment Policy and with the specific investment guidelines applicable to each investment manager. We use quoted values and other data provided by nationally recognized third-party pricing sources as inputs to our process for determining the value of our investment portfolio that is carried at fair value in our financial statements. 
Our Investment Policy establishes authority for our investment activities and specifies risk tolerances and minimum criteria on the overall credit quality and liquidity characteristics of the portfolio. This includes limitations on the size of certain holdings as well as restrictions on purchasing certain types of securities or investing in certain industries. Our investment managers may be instructed to invest some of the investment portfolio in currencies other than U.S. dollars based upon the business we have written, the currency in which our loss reserves are denominated or regulatory requirements.
Our Investment Policy incorporates a traditional policy limit approach to each type of risk, thus setting a maximum amount of capital that may be exposed at any one time to particular types of securities and investment vehicles. We develop and maintain an investment risk profile, including the establishment of risk limits, which is reviewed and revised by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors based on market conditions and our developing needs and includes estimates of the maximum and expected levels of investment risk relative to shareholders' equity that will be taken over a 12 month period. In determining our investment decisions, we consider the impact of various catastrophic events on our invested assets, particularly those to which our insurance and reinsurance portfolio may also be exposed, in order to protect our financial position. In addition, as part of our risk management processes, we maintain a watch list of securities that management considers to be at risk due to industry and/or issuer specific issues or securities potentially subject to future impairments. These securities are subjected to further internal analysis to evaluate their underlying structures, credit characteristics and overall industry and security specific fundamentals until they are sold, mature or it is deemed that further review is no longer necessary.

FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS
Financial strength ratings have become an increasingly important factor in evaluating the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies. Endurance Holdings and certain of its operating subsidiaries maintain a financial strength rating at A.M. Best of "A" (Excellent), an S&P rating of "A" (Strong) and a Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating of "A2". All three ratings agencies conducted reviews of Endurance Holdings during 2016. Syndicate 5151 (which is managed by Endurance at Lloyd's), as is the case with all Lloyd's syndicates, benefits from the Lloyd's single market rating. Lloyd's currently maintains a financial strength rating at A.M. Best of "A" (Excellent), an S&P rating of "A+" (Strong) and a Fitch Ratings Ltd. ("Fitch") rating of "AA-" (Very Strong). 
The objective of S&P's, A.M. Best's, Moody's and Fitch's rating systems is to provide an opinion of an insurer's or reinsurer's financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to its policyholders and debt holders. These ratings reflect S&P's, A.M. Best's and Moody's opinions of our capitalization, performance and management, and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold the Company’s securities. These ratings may be changed, suspended, or withdrawn at the discretion of S&P, A.M. Best, Moody's and Fitch.
S&P maintains a letter rating system ranging from "AAA" (Extremely Strong) to "R" (Under Regulatory Supervision). The rating "A" (Strong) by S&P is the sixth highest of twenty-one rating levels. Publications of S&P indicate that the "A" rating is assigned to those companies that, in S&P's opinion, have demonstrated strong financial security characteristics, but are somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than are insurers with higher ratings.
A.M. Best maintains a letter scale rating system ranging from "A++" (Superior) to "F" (In Liquidation). The rating "A" (Excellent) by A.M. Best is the third highest of 16 rating levels. Publications of A.M. Best indicate that the "A" rating is assigned to those companies that, in A.M. Best's opinion, have demonstrated an excellent ability to meet their obligations to policyholders.
Moody's maintains a letter rating system ranging from "Aaa" (highest quality, subject to the lowest level of credit risk) to "C" (lowest rated, typically in default, with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest). Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 to each generic rating classification from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category. The rating "A2" by Moody's is the sixth highest of twenty-one rating levels. Publications of Moody's indicate that the "A" rating is assigned to those companies that, in Moody's opinion, are judged to be upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk.
Fitch maintains a letter rating system ranging from "AAA" (highest credit quality companies, reliable and stable) to "NR" (not publicly rated). The rating "AA-" (Very Strong) by Fitch is the fourth highest of the 24 rating levels. Publications of Fitch indicate that the "AA-" rating is assigned to those companies that, in Fitch's opinion, have very low default risk, strong capacity for payment of financial commitments and are not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events. 
COMPETITION
The insurance and reinsurance industries are mature and highly competitive. Insurance and reinsurance companies compete on the basis of many factors, including premium charges, general reputation and perceived financial strength, the terms and conditions of the products offered, ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payments, reputation and experience in the particular risk to be underwritten, the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized, capacity and coverages offered and various other factors. These factors can effect transactions at the individual market participant level and in the aggregate across the insurance and reinsurance industry more generally. In addition, background economic conditions and variations in the insurance and reinsurance buying practices of insureds and ceding companies, by participant and in the aggregate, contribute to cyclical movements in rates, terms and conditions and may impact industry aggregate financial results.
We compete in the Bermuda, U.S., London and international insurance and reinsurance markets directly with numerous other parties, including established global insurance and reinsurance companies, start-up insurance and reinsurance entities, as well as potential capital markets and securitization structures aimed at managing catastrophe and other risks. Many of these entities have significantly larger amounts of capital and more employees than we maintain and have established long-term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry, which can be a significant competitive advantage.

REGULATORY MATTERS
General
The business of insurance and reinsurance is regulated in most countries, although the degree and type of regulation varies significantly from one jurisdiction to another. Reinsurers are generally subject to less direct regulation than primary insurers. Endurance Bermuda, Blue Capital Re, Blue Water Re and Blue Water Re II are regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority ("BMA"). Endurance Assurance, Endurance American, Endurance American Specialty, Endurance Risk Solutions and ARMtech are regulated by either Delaware or Texas insurance departments based on their state of domicile. Endurance U.K. and Endurance at Lloyd's are regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority ("PRA"), the Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA"), and in the case of Endurance at Lloyd's, by Lloyd's. 
Bermuda
The Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda and its related rules and regulations, as amended (the "Bermuda Insurance Act") regulates the insurance and reinsurance business of the following entities:
•Endurance Bermuda - Class 4 insurer;
•Blue Capital Re - Class 3A insurer;
•Blue Water Re - special purpose insurer; and
•Blue Water Re II - special purpose insurer. 
The Bermuda Insurance Act provides that no person may carry on any insurance business in or from within Bermuda unless registered as an insurer by the BMA under the Bermuda Insurance Act. References to insurance or insurance business in this summary are deemed to include references to reinsurance and reinsurance business. The BMA, in deciding whether to grant registration, has broad discretion to act as it thinks fit in the public interest. The BMA is required by the Bermuda Insurance Act to determine whether the applicant is a fit and proper body to be engaged in the insurance business and, in particular, whether it has, or has available to it, adequate knowledge and expertise. The continued registration of an applicant as an insurer is subject to it complying with the terms of its registration and such other conditions as the BMA may impose from time to time.
The Bermuda Insurance Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements on Bermuda insurance companies and grants the BMA powers to supervise, investigate, require information and the production of documents and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. Certain significant aspects of the Bermuda insurance regulatory framework are set forth below.
The BMA has enacted various legislative and regulatory amendments to the Bermuda Insurance Act to aid in Bermuda's achievement of regulatory equivalence with that of the European Commission's Solvency II framework in relation to commercial insurance entities. Bermuda has been awarded full equivalence for commercial insurers under Europe's Solvency II regime applicable to insurance companies, which came into effect on January 1, 2016. The Insurance Amendment Act 2015 (No. 2) ("Act No. 2") and the Insurance Amendment Act 2015 (No. 3) ("Act No. 3") were proposed during 2015 as part of the BMA's objective of receiving Solvency II equivalency. Act No. 2 and Act No. 3 were approved by the Bermuda Parliament with the majority of the changes becoming operative on January 1, 2016. Act No. 2 and Act No. 3 materially amend the Bermuda Insurance Act including to: (i) require certain classes of insurers (including the Company) to maintain their head offices in Bermuda; (ii) require insurers to notify the BMA of any reduction or disposal of shares taking a shareholder controller below 10%, 20%, 33% or 50%; (iii) permit certain classes of insurers to submit condensed audited GAAP financial statements; and (iv) establish the minimum criteria of matters of material significance whereby the approved auditor is required to provide written notice to the BMA of those matters that would impact the BMA's discharge of its functions under the Bermuda Insurance Act. The Act No. 3 also materially amends the Insurance Returns and Solvency Regulations 1980 to include the items and the content of the documents to be submitted as part of the required statutory financial returns for insurers carrying on special purpose business. The Insurance (Prudential Standards) (Class 4 and Class 3B Solvency Requirement) Amendment Rules 2015 and Insurance (Prudential Standards) (Class 3A Solvency Requirement) Amendment Rules 2015, effective as of January 1, 2016, expand the prudential standards of the Bermuda Insurance Act to include the requirements of insurers and insurance groups to meet regulatory capital and reporting requirements on a statutory economic capital and surplus basis. Further amendments to the Bermuda Insurance Act provide that all insurers are now required to implement corporate 
15

governance policies and processes as the BMA considers appropriate given the nature, size, complexity and risk profile of the insurer, and all insurers, on an annual basis, are now required to deliver a declaration to the BMA confirming whether or not they meet the minimum criteria for registration.
BCML is licensed as an insurance manager and agent under the Bermuda Insurance Act and is also licensed to carry on investment business under the Investment Business Act 2003, as amended. 
Classification of Insurers
The Bermuda Insurance Act distinguishes between insurers carrying on long-term business, insurers carrying on general business and insurers carrying on special purpose business. There are six classifications of insurers carrying on general business, ranging from Class 1 insurers (pure captives) to Class 4 insurers (very large commercial underwriters), with Class 4 insurers being subject to the strictest regulation. There is only one classification of special purpose insurer. The Endurance Holdings entities licensed in Bermuda are not licensed to carry on long-term business. Endurance Bermuda as a Class 4 insurer must (i) at the time of its application for registration, or before it carries on insurance business, have a total statutory capital and surplus of not less than $100.0 million and (ii) intend to carry on general insurance business, including excess liability business or property catastrophe reinsurance business. Class 4 insurers are required to maintain fully paid-up share capital of $1.0 million. Blue Capital Re as a Class 3A insurer must maintain fully paid-up capital of $120,000. Generally, Class 3A insurers must (i) intend to carry on general insurance business in circumstances where (a) 50% or more of the net premiums written or (b) 50% or more of the loss and loss exchange provisions, represent unrelated business; and (ii) its total net premiums written from unrelated business are less than $50.0 million. The total annual net premiums from unrelated business written by Blue Capital Re may, in the future, exceed $50.0 million, the maximum amount of total net premiums currently permitted by a Class 3A insurer. However, Blue Capital Re has obtained a waiver from the BMA so that it may remain a Class 3A insurer at all times, even if it writes more than $50.0 million in total annual net premiums from unrelated business. Blue Water Re and Blue Water Re II as special purpose insurers, must fully collateralize the insurance and reinsurance contracts they each write and all parties to these agreements must be sophisticated. Blue Water Re must notify the BMA of each reinsurance contract it writes and Blue Water Re II is only permitted to write business with Endurance Bermuda.
Cancellation of Insurer's Registration
An insurer's registration may be canceled by the BMA on certain grounds specified in the Bermuda Insurance Act, including failure of the insurer to comply with its obligations under the Bermuda Insurance Act or if, in the opinion of the BMA, the insurer has not been carrying on business in accordance with sound insurance principles.
Principal Representative, Head and Principal Office
Every registered insurer or reinsurer is required to maintain a principal office in Bermuda and to appoint and maintain a principal representative in Bermuda, subject to certain prescribed requirements under the Bermuda Insurance Act. Further, any registered insurer that is a Class 3A insurer or above is required to maintain a head office in Bermuda and direct and manage its insurance business from Bermuda. The recent amendments to the Bermuda Insurance Act provide that in considering whether an insurer satisfies the requirements of having its head office in Bermuda, the BMA may consider (a) where the underwriting, risk management and operational decision making occurs; (b) whether the presence of senior executives who are responsible for, and involved in, the decision making are located in Bermuda; and (c) where meetings of the board of directors occur. The BMA will also consider (a) the location where management meets to effect policy decisions; (b) the residence of the officers, insurance managers or employees; and (c) the residence of one or more directors in Bermuda. 
For the purpose of the Bermuda Insurance Act, Endurance Bermuda, Blue Capital Re, Blue Water Re and Blue Water Re II's principal office is the Company's executive offices at Waterloo House, 100 Pitts Bay Road, Pembroke HM 08, Bermuda. Michael J. McGuire has been appointed by the Board of Directors as Endurance Bermuda's principal representative and has been approved by the BMA. BCML has been appointed and approved as the principal representative for Blue Capital Re, Blue Water Re and Blue Water Re II. The principal representative has statutory reporting duties under the Bermuda Insurance Act for certain reportable events, such as threatened insolvency or non-compliance with the Bermuda Insurance Act or with a condition or restriction imposed on an insurer.
Where there has been a significant loss that is reasonably likely to cause Endurance Bermuda and/or Blue Capital Re to fail to comply with its enhanced capital requirement (as described in more detail below), the principal representative must furnish the BMA with a capital and solvency return reflecting an enhanced capital requirement prepared using post-loss data. The principal representative must provide this within forty-five days of notifying the BMA of the loss.
16

In addition, where a notification has been made to the BMA regarding a material change to an insurer's business or structure (as described in more detail below), the principal representative has thirty days from the date of such notification to provide to the BMA unaudited interim statutory financial statements in relation to such period if so requested by the BMA, together with a general business solvency certificate in respect of those statements.
Independent Approved Auditor
Every registered insurer must appoint an independent auditor who will audit and report annually on the statutory financial statements and the statutory financial return of the insurer, both of which, in the case of Endurance Bermuda, are required to be filed annually with the BMA. Each of Blue Capital Re, Blue Water Re and Blue Water Re II has obtained a waiver under the Bermuda Insurance Act and is not required to file audited statutory financial statements and statutory financial returns annually with the BMA; however, Blue Capital Re, Blue Water Re and Blue Water Re II are each required to file annual audited GAAP financial statements with the BMA. Endurance Bermuda, Blue Capital Re, Blue Water Re and Blue Water Re II's independent auditor must be approved by the BMA and may be the same person or firm that audits Endurance Holdings' consolidated financial statements and reports for presentation to its shareholders. Ernst & Young Ltd., the independent auditor of Endurance Bermuda, Blue Capital Re, Blue Water Re and Blue Water Re II, has been approved by the BMA.
Loss Reserve Specialist and Group Actuary
As a registered Class 4 insurer, Endurance Bermuda is required to appoint and maintain a loss reserve specialist who is required to submit an opinion with Endurance Bermuda’s statutory financial return in respect of Endurance Bermuda’s losses and loss expenses provisions. The loss reserve specialist, who will normally be a qualified property and casualty actuary, must be approved by the BMA. Jeffrey Dollinger, Chief Reserving Actuary for the Company, has been appointed by the Board of Directors and has been approved by the BMA to act as Endurance Bermuda's loss reserve specialist.
Blue Capital Re, Blue Water Re and Blue Water Re II are not currently required to obtain an opinion form a loss reserve specialist in respect of their stand-alone loss and loss expenses provisions.
Endurance Bermuda, as the Designated Insurer for the Group (see further below), is required to ensure that the Group appoints an actuary approved by the BMA to provide an opinion as to the adequacy of the Group's insurance reserves as reported in its group statutory financial statements. Mr. Dollinger has also been approved by the BMA to act as the Approved Group Actuary for the Group.
Group Supervision
The BMA may, in respect of an insurance group, determine whether it is appropriate for it to act as its group supervisor. An insurance group is defined as a group of companies that conducts exclusively, or mainly, insurance business. The BMA may make such determination where it ascertains that (i) the group is headed by a "specified insurer", which is a Class 3A, Class 3B or Class 4 general business insurer or a Class C, Class D or Class E long-term insurer or another class of insurer designated by order of the BMA; (ii) where the insurance group is not headed by a specified insurer, where it is headed by a parent company which is incorporated in Bermuda; or (iii) where the parent company of the group is not a Bermuda company, in circumstances where the BMA is satisfied that the insurance group is directed and managed from Bermuda or the insurer with the largest balance sheet total is a specified insurer.
Where the BMA determines that it should act as the group supervisor, it shall designate a specified insurer that is a member of the insurance group to be the designated insurer (the "Designated Insurer") and it shall give to the Designated Insurer and other competent authorities written notice of its intention to act as group supervisor. Endurance Bermuda has been notified by the BMA that the Company's group of insurance and reinsurance companies (the "Group") is subject to group supervision by the BMA, and that Endurance Bermuda is the Designated Insurer in respect of the Group for purposes of the Bermuda Insurance Act.
Pursuant to its powers under the Bermuda Insurance Act as group supervisor, the BMA maintains a register of particulars for the Group detailing, among other things, the names and addresses of the Designated Insurer; each member company of the Group falling within the scope of group supervision; the principal representative of the Group in Bermuda; other competent authorities supervising other member companies of the Group; and the Group's auditors. The BMA and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority signed a memorandum of understanding in January 2017 (the "MoU") under which each authority agrees to provide mutual assistance and the exchange of information to ensure optimal supervision for insurance and reinsurance groups with international activities in the European Union and Bermuda. The BMA may share information about the Group with the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority if a request is made pursuant to the terms set out in the MoU.
17

The specific duties of the Designated Insurer include reporting obligations, the establishment of key Group functions, and notification to the BMA of material changes, certain specified events generally related to impairment to the Group financial condition or breaches by the Group, the appointment of auditors and actuaries and duties related to the financial condition of the Group.
In addition, the BMA has issued insurance group supervision rules in respect of the assessment of the financial situation and solvency, the system of governance and risk management, supervisory reporting and disclosures, the capital and solvency reporting requirements and capital requirements.
Annual Statutory and GAAP Financial Statements
Endurance Bermuda, as a Class 4 insurer, must prepare and file with the BMA annual statutory financial statements as prescribed by the Bermuda Insurance Act. The Designated Insurer on behalf of the Group must prepare and file with the BMA annual group statutory financial statements. The Bermuda Insurance Act prescribes rules for the preparation and substance of these statutory financial statements (which include, in statutory form, a balance sheet, an income statement, a statement of capital and surplus and notes thereto). The insurer or group is required to give detailed information and analyses regarding premiums, claims, reinsurance and investments.
Endurance Bermuda, as a Class 4 insurer, and the Designated Insurer on behalf of the Group are also required to prepare and file with the BMA audited annual financial statements and audited annual group financial statements respectively, prepared in accordance with GAAP or International Financial Reporting Standards.
Blue Capital Re, Blue Water Re and Blue Water Re II are each required to file annual audited GAAP financial statements with the BMA, as the requirement to file audited statutory financial statements and statutory financial returns annually with the BMA has been waived by the BMA.
Annual Statutory Financial Return
Endurance Bermuda, as a Class 4 insurer, is required to file with the BMA an annual statutory financial return. The statutory financial return for a Class 4 insurer includes, among other matters, a report of the approved independent auditor on the statutory financial statements of the insurer, solvency certificates, the statutory financial statements, the opinion of the loss reserve specialist and a schedule of reinsurance ceded. The solvency certificates must be signed by the principal representative and at least two directors of the insurer certifying that the minimum solvency margin and the minimum liquidity ratio have been met and must further certify whether the insurer has complied with the conditions attached to its certificate of registration. The statutory financial statements and the statutory financial return do not form part of the public records maintained by the BMA.
The Designated Insurer on behalf of the Group is required to file with the BMA an annual group statutory financial return. The group statutory financial return includes, among other matters, a group solvency certificate, particulars of ceded reinsurance, a list of non-insurance financial regulated entities owned by the Group, the opinion of the Group actuary and particulars of qualifying members as defined within the Group Supervision Rules. The group statutory financial return is not subject to independent audit.
Bermuda Insurer Capital Requirements
As a Class 4 insurer, Endurance Bermuda is required to maintain available statutory capital adequacy and surplus at a level equal to or in excess of its enhanced capital requirement ("ECR"), which is established by reference to either the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement model ("BSCR") or an approved internal capital model. An insurer may file an application under the Bermuda Insurance Act to have its ECR requirements waived. Blue Capital Re has obtained such a waiver from the BMA. Blue Water Re and Blue Water Re II, as special purpose insurers, are not subject to the ECR requirements.
The BSCR provides a risk-based capital model as a tool to assist the BMA both in measuring risk and in determining appropriate levels of capitalization. The BSCR employs a standard mathematical model that correlates the risk underwritten by Bermuda insurers and reinsurers to the capital that is dedicated to their business. The framework that has been developed applies a standard measurement format to the risk associated with an insurer's or reinsurer's assets, liabilities and premiums, including a formula to take account of catastrophe risk exposure. Where an insurer or reinsurer believes that its own internal model for measuring risk and determining appropriate levels of capital better reflects the inherent risk of its business, it may apply to the BMA for approval to use its internal capital model in substitution for the BSCR model. The BMA may approve an insurer's or reinsurer's internal model, provided certain conditions have been established, and may revoke approval of an internal model in the event that the conditions are no longer met or where it feels that the revocation is appropriate. The BMA 
18

reviews the internal model regularly to confirm that the model continues to meet the conditions. Endurance Bermuda utilizes the BMA's standard BSCR model for calculating its capital requirements.
While not specifically incorporated into the Bermuda Insurance Act, the BMA has established a target capital level for Class 4 insurers equal to 120% of their ECR ("TCL"). While a Class 4 insurer is not currently required to maintain its statutory capital and surplus at this level, the TCL serves as an early warning sign for the BMA, and failure to maintain statutory capital at least equal to the TCL will likely result in increased regulatory oversight by the BMA. Endurance Bermuda's capital level exceeded the TCL level as of December 31, 2016. The Bermuda Insurance Act also provides that the value of the statutory assets of a Class 4 insurer must exceed the value of its statutory liabilities by an amount greater than its prescribed minimum margin of solvency ("MSM"). The MSM that must be maintained at all times by a Class 4 insurer, such as Endurance Bermuda, with respect to its general business is the greater of: (a) $100.0 million; (b) 50% of net premiums written (with a credit for reinsurance ceded not exceeding 25% of gross premiums written); and (c) 15% of net loss and loss expense provisions and other general business insurance reserves.
In relation to the Group, the Designated Insurer must ensure that the value of the Group's assets exceeds the amount of the Group's liabilities by the aggregate MSM of each qualifying member of the Group. The Group is also required to maintain available group capital and surplus equal to the Group's ECR.
In order to demonstrate compliance with required capital levels, Endurance Bermuda and the Designated Insurer on behalf of the Group are each required to prepare and file a capital and solvency return, which sets out the calculation of applicable capital, as well as the risk management practices and other information used to calculate applicable capital.
The BMA requires Endurance Bermuda, as a Class 4 insurer, and the Group, as a Bermuda insurance group, to perform an assessment of their own risk and solvency requirements, referred to as a Commercial Insurer's Solvency Self Assessment ("CISSA") and the Group Solvency Self Assessment ("GSSA"). The CISSA and the GSSA provide the BMA with an entity's or group's (as applicable) view of the capital resources required to achieve its business objectives and to assess the insurer or insurance group’s governance, risk management and controls surrounding this process. In addition, Class 4 insurers and insurance groups are required to prepare and file with the BMA a catastrophe risk return, which assesses an insurer's reliance on vendor models in assessing catastrophe exposure.
Restrictions on Dividends, Distributions and Reduction of Capital
Under the Bermuda Insurance Act, Endurance Bermuda and Blue Capital Re are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus, as shown on its previous financial year statutory balance sheet, unless at least seven days before payment of the dividends it files with the BMA an affidavit signed by at least two directors and by the insurer's principal representative in Bermuda that the declaration of such dividend has not caused the insurer to fail to meet its relevant margins. In addition, Endurance Bermuda and Blue Capital Re are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during any financial year if they are in breach of their ECR, solvency margins or liquidity ratios (as described in more detail below) or if the declaration of such dividend would cause a breach.
Furthermore, under the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda, as amended (the "Bermuda Companies Act"), Bermuda domiciled companies may only declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution from contributed surplus, if the company has no reasonable grounds for believing that it is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due, or if the realizable value of its assets would be less than its liabilities.
Endurance Bermuda as a Class 4 insurer must obtain the BMA's prior approval before reducing its total statutory capital, as shown on its previous financial year statutory balance sheet, by 15% or more and any application for such approval must include an affidavit signed by at least two directors and by the insurer's principal representative in Bermuda stating that the proposed reduction of capital will not cause the insurer to fail to meet its relevant margins.
Minimum Liquidity Ratio
The Bermuda Insurance Act provides for a minimum liquidity ratio for general business insurers, like Endurance Bermuda and Blue Capital Re. An insurer engaged in general insurance business is required to maintain the value of its relevant assets at not less than 75% of the amount of its relevant liabilities. Relevant assets include, but are not limited to, cash and time deposits, quoted investments, unquoted bonds and debentures, first liens on real estate, investment income due and accrued, accounts and premiums receivable, reinsurance balances receivable and funds held by ceding reinsurers. There are certain categories of assets which, unless specifically permitted by the BMA, do not automatically qualify as relevant assets, such as unquoted equity securities, investments in and advances to affiliates and real estate and collateral loans. The relevant liabilities are total general business insurance reserves and total other liabilities less deferred income tax and sundry liabilities (by interpretation, those not specifically defined), letters of credit and guarantees.

Supervision, Investigation and Intervention
The BMA may appoint an inspector with extensive powers to investigate and report on the affairs of Endurance Bermuda, Blue Capital Re, Blue Water Re, Blue Water Re II or the Group if the BMA believes that such an investigation is in the best interests of its policyholders or persons who may become policyholders. Such an inspector also has the power to investigate the business of any person who is or at any relevant time was a member of the Group of which the person under investigation is a part or a partnership of which the person under investigation is part. In order to verify or supplement information otherwise provided to the BMA, the BMA may direct a company to produce documents or information relating to matters connected with its business. In addition, the BMA has the power to require the production of documents from any person who appears to be in possession of such documents. Further, the BMA has the power, in respect of a person registered under the Bermuda Insurance Act, to appoint a professional person to prepare a report on any aspect of any matter about which the BMA has required or could require information. If it appears to the BMA to be desirable in the interests of the clients of a person registered under the Bermuda Insurance Act, the BMA may also exercise these powers in relation to any company which is or has at any relevant time been (a) a parent company, subsidiary company or related company of that registered person; (b) a subsidiary company of a parent company of that registered person, (c) a parent company of a subsidiary company of that registered person; or (d) a company in the case of which a shareholder controller of that registered person, either alone or with any associate or associates, holds 50 percent or more of the shares or is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise, of more than 50 percent of the voting power at a general meeting.
If it appears to the BMA that there is a significant risk of a company becoming insolvent, or that a company is in breach of the Bermuda Insurance Act or any conditions imposed upon its registration, the BMA may, among other things, direct the company (i) not to effect further contracts of insurance, or any contract of insurance of a specified description; (ii) to limit the aggregate of the premiums to be written by it during a specified period beginning not earlier than 28 days after the direction is given; (iii) not to vary any contract of insurance in force when the direction is given, if the effect of the variation would be to increase the liabilities of the insurer; (iv) not to make any investment of a specified class; (v) before the expiration of a specified period (or such longer period as the BMA may allow) to realize any existing investment of a specified class; (vi) not to declare or pay any dividends or any other distributions, or to restrict the making of such payments to such extent as the BMA thinks fit; (vii) not to enter into any specified transaction with any specified person or persons of a specified class; (viii) to provide such written particulars relating to the financial circumstances of the insurer as the BMA thinks fit; (ix) to obtain the opinion of a loss reserve specialist with respect to general business, or an actuarial opinion with respect to long-term business, and to submit it to the BMA within a specified time; (x) to remove a controller or officer; and (xi) to maintain in, or transfer to and keep in the custody of, a specified bank, assets of the insurer of such value and description as the BMA may direct.
Disclosure of Information
In addition to powers under the Bermuda Insurance Act to investigate the affairs of an insurer, the BMA may require certain information from an insurer (or certain other persons) to be produced to them. Further, the BMA has the power to assist other regulatory authorities, including foreign insurance regulatory authorities, with their investigations involving insurance and reinsurance companies in Bermuda but subject to restrictions. For example, the BMA must be satisfied that the assistance being requested is in connection with the discharge of regulatory responsibilities of the foreign regulatory authority. Further, the BMA must consider whether cooperation is in the public interest. The grounds for disclosure are limited and the Bermuda Insurance Act provides sanctions for breach of the statutory duty of confidentiality.
The Insurance Code of Conduct
The BMA has implemented the Insurance Code of Conduct, which establishes duties, requirements and compliance standards to be adhered to by all insurers registered under the Bermuda Insurance Act, including procedure and sound principles to be observed by insurers. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Insurance Code of Conduct will be a factor taken into account by the BMA in determining whether an insurer is conducting its business in a sound and prudent manner as prescribed by the Bermuda Insurance Act and could result in the BMA exercising its powers of intervention as well as being a factor in calculating the operational risk charge applicable to that insurer's risk based capital model. Endurance Bermuda, Blue Capital Re, Blue Water Re and Blue Water Re II are each subject to the Insurance Code of Conduct and are required to file annually a statutory declaration confirming its compliance with the Insurance Code of Conduct.
20

The Insurance Manager Code of Conduct
In 2016, the BMA implemented the Insurance Manager Code of Conduct, which establishes duties, requirements and compliance standards to be adhered to by all insurance managers registered under the Bermuda Insurance Act, including the procedure and sound principles to be observed by insurance managers. Insurance managers were required to implement the Insurance Manager Code of Conduct into their operations by December 31, 2016. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Insurance Manager Code of Conduct will be taken into account by the BMA in assessing whether the insurance manager has satisfied its requirement under the minimum criteria for registration to conduct its business in a prudent manner. However, the BMA takes a proportionate approach to compliance, taking into consideration the nature, scale and complexity of an insurance managers' business. BCML is subject to the Insurance Manager Code of Conduct and will be required to file annually prior to June 30 an annual return, and a statutory declaration confirming its compliance with the Insurance Manager Code of Conduct. 
Notifications to the BMA
The BMA maintains supervision over the controllers of all registered insurers in Bermuda. A controller includes (i) the managing director of the registered insurer or its parent company; (ii) the chief executive of the registered insurer or of its parent company; (iii) a shareholder controller; and (iv) any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the registered insurer or of its parent company are accustomed to act, including any person who holds, or is entitled to exercise, 10% or more of the voting shares or voting power or is able to exercise a significant influence over the management of the insurer.
The definition of "shareholder controller" is set out in the Bermuda Insurance Act but generally refers to (i) a person who holds 10% or more of the shares carrying rights to vote at a shareholders' meeting of the registered insurer or its parent company, or (ii) a person who is entitled to exercise 10% or more of the voting power at any shareholders' meeting of such registered insurer or its parent company, or (iii) a person who is able to exercise significant influence over the management of the registered insurer or its parent company by virtue of its shareholding or its entitlement to exercise, or control the exercise of, the voting power at any shareholders' meeting.
Where an insurer's shares or its parent company's shares are traded on any stock exchange recognized by the BMA, then any shareholder must notify the BMA within 45 days of becoming or ceasing to be a 10 percent, 20 percent, 33 percent, or 50 percent shareholder controller of such insurer. The notice has to be given within 45 days of the shareholder becoming aware of the relevant facts. These provisions are applicable to us and our shareholders although we are unlikely to ever trigger the shareholder controller provisions in respect of U.S. shareholders due to the limitation on voting provisions in Endurance Bermuda’s bye-laws.
Endurance Bermuda is also required to notify the BMA in writing in the event any person has become or ceased to be an officer of Endurance Bermuda. For these purposes, an "officer" is defined as being a director, chief executive or senior executive performing duties of underwriting, actuarial, risk management, compliance, internal audit, finance or investment matters. Failure to give a required notice is an offence under the Bermuda Insurance Act.
No insurer, or designated insurer, in respect of the group of which it is a member, may effect or allow another member of the group to effect a material change unless notice in writing of the material change has been served on the BMA and the BMA has not before the end of thirty days from the date of service of the notice notified it in writing that it has objected to the effecting of the material change. A "material change" includes (i) an acquisition or transfer of insurance business being part of a scheme falling within, or any transaction relating to a scheme of arrangement under, section 25 of the Bermuda Insurance Act or section 99 of the Bermuda Companies Act, (ii) an amalgamation with or acquisition of another firm, (iii) engaging in unrelated business that is retail business, (iv) an acquisition of controlling interest in an undertaking that is engaged in non-insurance business that offers services and products to persons who are not affiliates of the insurer; (v) outsourcing all or substantially all of the functions of actuarial, risk management, compliance or internal audit; (vi) outsourcing of all or a material part of an insurer's underwriting activity; (vii) the transfer other than by way of reinsurance of all or substantially all of a line of business; (viii) expansion into a material new line of business; (ix) the sale of an insurer; and (x) outsourcing of an officer role. Failure to give such notice constitutes an offence under the Bermuda Insurance Act. It is possible to appeal a notice of objection served by the BMA.

Bermuda Guidance Notes
The BMA has issued Guidance Notes on the application of the Bermuda Insurance Act in respect of the duties, requirements and standards to be complied with by persons registered under the Bermuda Insurance Act or otherwise regulated under it and the procedures and sound principles to be observed by such persons and by auditors, principal representatives and loss reserve specialists. The BMA continues to issue Guidance Notes through its web site at www.bma.bm. These provide guidance on, among other things, the roles of the principal representative, approved auditor, and approved actuary and corporate governance for Bermuda insurers and insurance groups. The BMA has stated that the Guidance Notes should be understood as reflecting the minimum standard that the BMA expects insurers such as Endurance Bermuda and other relevant parties to observe at all times.
Winding-up
The BMA may present a petition for the winding-up of an insurer on the ground that the insurer (a) is unable to pay its debts within the meaning of Sections 161 and 162 of the Bermuda Companies Act, (b) has failed to satisfy an obligation to which it is or was subject by virtue of the Bermuda Insurance Act, or (c) has failed to satisfy the obligation imposed upon it by Section 15 as to the preparation of accounts or to produce or file statutory financial statements in accordance with Section 17 (save where the appropriate waivers have been obtained), and that the BMA is unable to ascertain the insurer’s financial position. In addition, if it appears to the BMA that it is expedient in the public interest that an insurer should be wound up, it may present a petition for it to be so wound up if a court thinks it just and equitable for it to be so wound up.
Certain Other Bermuda Law Considerations
Endurance Holdings, Endurance Bermuda, BCRH, Blue Capital Re, Blue Capital Re ILS, Blue Water Re, Blue Water Re II and BCML each are required to comply with the provisions of the Bermuda Companies Act regulating the payment of dividends and making of distributions from contributed surplus. Each company is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend, or making a distribution out of contributed surplus, if there are reasonable grounds for believing that: (a) the company is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due; or (b) the realizable value of the company’s assets would thereby be less than its liabilities.
Although Endurance Holdings, Endurance Bermuda, BCRH, Blue Capital Re, Blue Capital Re ILS, Blue Water Re, Blue Water Re II and BCML are incorporated in Bermuda, they are classified as a non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes by the BMA. Pursuant to their non-resident status, each of these companies may engage in transactions in currencies other than Bermuda dollars and there are no restrictions on its ability to transfer funds (other than funds denominated in Bermuda dollars) in and out of Bermuda or, in the case of Endurance Holdings and BCRH, to pay dividends to United States residents who are holders of its ordinary shares.
Under Bermuda law, exempted companies are companies formed for the purpose of conducting business outside Bermuda from a principal place of business in Bermuda. As "exempted" companies, Endurance Holdings, Endurance Bermuda, BCRH, Blue Capital Re, Blue Capital Re ILS, Blue Water Re, Blue Water Re II and BCML may not, without the express authorization of the Bermuda legislature or under a license or consent granted by the Bermuda Minister of Economic Development, participate in certain business transactions, including: (1) the acquisition or holding of land in Bermuda (recent changes to the law enable exempted companies to purchase land in Bermuda outright for commercial and residential purposes, subject to obtaining ministerial consent and certain other conditions); (2) the taking of mortgages on land in Bermuda to secure an amount in excess of $50,000; (3) to acquire any bonds or debentures secured on any land in Bermuda except bonds or debentures issued by the Government of Bermuda or a public authority or (4) the carrying on of business of any kind for which it is not licensed in Bermuda, except in certain limited circumstances such as doing business with another exempted undertaking in furtherance of Endurance Holdings' business carried on outside Bermuda. Endurance Bermuda, Blue Capital Re, Blue Water Re and Blue Water Re II as licensed insurers in Bermuda, may carry on activities from Bermuda that are related to and in support of its insurance and reinsurance business. While an insurer is permitted to reinsure risks undertaken by any company incorporated in Bermuda and permitted to engage in the insurance and reinsurance business, generally it is not permitted without a special license granted by the Minister of Economic Development to insure Bermuda domestic risks or risks of persons of, in or based in Bermuda.
Securities may be offered or sold in Bermuda only in compliance with the provisions of the Investment Business Act 2003, and the Exchange Control Act 1972, and related regulations of Bermuda which regulate the sale of securities in Bermuda. In addition, specific permission is required from the BMA, pursuant to the provisions of the Exchange Control Act 1972 and related regulations, for all issuances and transfers of securities of Bermuda companies, other than in cases where the BMA has granted a general permission. The BMA, in its policy dated June 1, 2005, provides that where any equity securities, which would include our ordinary and preferred shares, of a Bermuda company are listed on an appointed stock exchange (the New York Stock Exchange is deemed to be an appointed stock exchange under Bermuda law), general permission is given for the 
22

issue and subsequent transfer of any securities of a company from and/or to a non-resident, for as long as any equity securities of the company remain so listed. The ordinary and preferred shares of Endurance Holdings are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the shares of BCRH are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Bermuda Stock Exchange, and the shares of BCGR are listed on the Specialist Fund Market of the London Stock Exchange and on the Bermuda Stock Exchange.
Notwithstanding the above general permission, the BMA has granted us permission to, subject to our ordinary or voting shares being listed on an appointed stock exchange, issue, grant, create, sell and transfer any of our shares, stock, bonds, notes (other than promissory notes), debentures, debenture stock, units under a unit trust scheme, shares in an oil royalty, options, warrants, coupons, rights and depository receipts (collectively, the "Securities") to and among persons who are either resident or non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes, whether or not the Securities (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, our ordinary or voting shares) are listed on an appointed stock exchange.
The Minister of Finance, under Bermuda's Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966, as amended, has given us a written assurance that if any legislation is enacted in Bermuda that would impose tax on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then the imposition of any such tax will not be applicable to us or any of our operations or our shares, debentures or other obligations until March 31, 2035. It is possible that after March 31, 2035 we may be subject to Bermuda taxes.
The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 2016 became operative in Bermuda on March 28, 2016 and permits third parties, who are expressly identified in a contract but not specifically party to such contract, to be entitled to enforce and benefit from the terms of the contract, subject to certain requirements. The Bermuda legislation closely resembles the existing UK rights of third parties legislation. 
Bermuda Work Permit Considerations
Generally, under Bermuda law, non-Bermudians (other than spouses of Bermudians and individuals holding permanent resident's certificates or working resident's certificates) may not engage in any gainful occupation in Bermuda without the appropriate governmental standard work permit.
Standard work permits can be obtained for a one-, two-, three-, four- or five-year period. Ten year permits are also available but these are generally only applicable where a company meets various criteria, including at least 10 Bermudian staff, development programs for Bermudians, entry level position and equal pay between Bermudians and non-Bermudians. Recent changes to the law now enable an employer to apply for an exemption from the requirement to hold a work permit in respect of its senior executives. Certain senior executives are also now eligible to apply for a permanent resident certificate. Where a standard work permit is being applied for, it is a requirement that the job must be advertised for three days (within an eight-day period) in a local Bermuda newspaper.
U.K. Regulation
General
In the U.K., parts of the Endurance business are subject to regulation by the Prudential Regulation Authority ("PRA") and the Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA"). The PRA oversees and is responsible for the micro-prudential regulation of banks, insurers and some investment firms. The FCA, which is a separate entity, is responsible for the conduct of business regulation in relation to all authorized firms and the prudential regulation of firms not regulated by the PRA as well as the majority of the market regulatory functions previously conducted by the Financial Services Authority. In addition, the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee is responsible for the macro-prudential regulation of the entire financial services sector. Under this regulatory structure Endurance U.K. and Endurance at Lloyd's are supervised by both the FCA and the PRA. Endurance Global Weather Risk Advisers Ltd ("EGWRAL") is regulated by only the FCA. In addition, the Council of Lloyd's is responsible under the Lloyd's Act 1982 for the management and supervision of Lloyd's, including its members, syndicates and managing agents, and has rule-making and enforcement powers. The Council of Lloyd's may discharge some of its functions directly by making decisions and issuing resolutions, requirements, rules and byelaws. Other decisions are delegated to the Lloyd's Franchise Board and associated committees. The PRA and FCA, when relevant, coordinate with each other and Lloyd's over its use of enforcement powers. Endurance Corporate Capital Limited ("ECCL") and Endurance at Lloyd's are subject to regulation by Lloyd's.
23

Supervision
The PRA's approach to supervision of insurance companies is forward looking and judgment based. In taking a forward looking approach, the PRA looks at the current risks faced by a firm, and also possible future risks that may impact on the safety and soundness of a firm's business. By using quantitative and qualitative analysis, the PRA uses its risk assessment framework to form a judgment about the level and type of supervision required for a firm based on how great a risk the firm poses to the stability of the United Kingdom financial system.
The FCA's supervisory focus is on good market conduct and consumer protection, and it also takes a risk-based approach to supervision. The FCA makes judgments and takes action based on the risks posed by firms to the FCA meeting its objectives. There are three elements to the FCA's supervision framework:

• | the firm systematic framework, which is designed to assess a firm's conduct risk by reference to the firm's business model and an assessment of how it embeds fair treatment of customers and ensures market integrity in its conduct of business;


• | event-driven work to enable the FCA to respond quickly to identified risks in the market; and


• | issues and product focused work to enable the FCA to deal promptly with emerging issues that might put customers at risk.

Endurance U.K.
Insurance business in the United Kingdom is divided between two main categories: long-term insurance (which is primarily investment-related and life insurance) and general insurance. These two categories are both further divided into "classes" of business. Under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 as amended ("FSMA"), effecting or carrying out contracts of insurance, within a class of general or long-term insurance, by way of business in the United Kingdom, constitutes a regulated activity requiring individual authorization. An authorized insurance company must have permission for each class of insurance business it intends to write.
Endurance U.K. is authorized to effect and carry out in the United Kingdom contracts of insurance in all classes of general insurance (limited in the case of credit and surety to reinsurance only) except legal expenses and assistance business. On January 14, 2005, as a result of the implementation by the United Kingdom Government of the Insurance Mediation Directive (2002/92/EC), various additional activities, which had previously been unregulated, fell within the scope of United Kingdom regulation.
Accordingly, Endurance U.K. is authorized to conduct the following additional regulated activities: arranging (bringing about) deals in investments and making arrangements with a view to transactions in investments. In both cases, these activities are restricted to non-investment insurance contracts. Endurance U.K. is also authorized to accept deposits (limited to accepting deposits in the course of carrying on insurance business for which it holds permission).
As an authorized insurer in the United Kingdom, Endurance U.K. is able to operate throughout the European Union, subject to certain additional regulatory requirements. An insurance company with authorization to write insurance business in the United Kingdom can seek consent from the PRA to allow it to provide cross-border services in other member states of the E.U. As an alternative, PRA consent may be obtained to establish a branch office within another member state, which may require compliance with certain additional local regulatory requirements in respect of the branch.
As an authorized insurer, the insurance and reinsurance businesses of Endurance U.K. are subject to close supervision by the PRA and the FCA. There are a number of specific requirements for governance and risk management, including in respect of senior management arrangements and systems and controls, which place a strong emphasis on risk identification and management in relation to the prudential regulation of insurance and reinsurance business in the United Kingdom.
Syndicate 5151, ECCL and Endurance at Lloyd's
ECCL, Syndicate 5151's corporate underwriting member at Lloyd's, provides 100% of the stamp capacity of Syndicate 5151. Stamp capacity is a measure of the amount of premium a syndicate is authorized to write by Lloyd's. Syndicate 5151's stamp capacity for 2017 is £370.0 million compared to £220.0 million for 2016. 
As a corporate underwriting member of Lloyd's, ECCL is bound by the rules of Lloyd's, which are prescribed by byelaws and requirements made by the Council of Lloyd's under powers conferred by the Lloyd's Act 1982. These rules, among other matters, prescribe ECCL's membership subscription, the level of its contribution to the Lloyd's New Central Fund and the 
24

assets it must deposit with Lloyd's in support of its underwriting. The Council of Lloyd's has broad powers to sanction breaches of its rules, including the power to restrict or prohibit a member's participation in Lloyd's syndicates.
Under the U.K. regulatory regime, Endurance at Lloyd's, as a managing agent regulated by the PRA and FCA, in addition to Lloyd's, is required, among other matters, to adopt internal systems and controls appropriate to the risks of their business, obtain regulatory approval for those members of staff responsible for performing certain controlled functions and calculate the level of capital required to support the underwriting of the syndicates that it manages. It is also subject to minimum solvency tests and is required to conduct its business according to eleven core regulatory principles, to which all firms regulated by the PRA and FCA are subject. Each corporate or individual member of Lloyd's is required to deposit cash, securities or letters of credit (or a combination of these assets) with Lloyd's to support its participation on Lloyd's syndicates. These assets are known as a member's "Funds at Lloyd's." Funds at Lloyd's requirements are calculated according to a minimum capital resources requirement, which is assessed at the syndicate level by Lloyd's and at the level of the Lloyd's market as a whole by the PRA. This requirement is similar in effect to a required solvency margin. Endurance Bermuda holds cash and securities in trust of $323.6 million at December 31, 2016 and $276.8 million at December 31, 2015 on behalf of ECCL in support of its participation in Syndicate 5151.
The Council of Lloyd's also supervises the companies or partnerships authorized by managing agents to enter into contracts of insurance on behalf of Lloyd's syndicates ("Coverholders"), including those of Endurance at Lloyd's, as part of its statutory role in managing and supervising the Lloyd's market. This supervision is carried out through the approval process and through Lloyd's ongoing supervision of Coverholders. Local regulators may require Lloyd's to demonstrate that it has control over, and responsibility for, the business carried out by Coverholders under the terms of Lloyd's authorization in that jurisdiction. Nonetheless, the primary responsibility for the oversight of Coverholders and binding authorities on a day-to-day basis rests with Lloyd's managing agents, such as Endurance at Lloyd's. 
At the syndicate level, managing agents are required to calculate the capital resources requirement of the members of each syndicate they manage in accordance with the Solvency II framework (as described in more detail below), replacing the Individual Capital Adequacy ("ICA") regime under Solvency I. Lloyd's requires that each syndicate calculate a Solvency II Solvency Capital Requirement ("SCR"). In the case of Syndicate 5151, this utilized ECCL's own internal model equivalent to the Solvency II principles. Both the SCR and former ICA requirement evaluate the risks faced by the syndicate, including insurance risk, operational risk, market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and group risk, and assess the amount of capital that syndicate members should hold against those risks.
Lloyd's reviews each syndicate's SCR annually and may challenge it. In order to ensure that Lloyd's aggregate capital is maintained at a high enough level to support its overall security rating, Lloyd's adds an uplift to each member's overall capital resources requirement produced by the ICA or SCR. The aggregate amount is known as a syndicate's Economic Capital Assessment, which is used by Lloyd's to determine the syndicate's required Funds at Lloyd's.
At market level, Lloyd's is required to demonstrate to the PRA that each member's capital resources requirement is met by that member's capital resources made available to Lloyd's, which for this purpose comprises its Funds at Lloyd's and its share of member capital held at syndicate level. Any deficits must be covered by the Lloyd's New Central Fund, which is itself subject to review by the PRA for the purposes of the capital adequacy of the market as a whole. The Council of Lloyd's has wide discretionary powers to regulate members' underwriting at Lloyd's. It may, for instance, vary the amount of a member's Funds at Lloyd's requirement (or alter the ways in which those funds may be invested). The exercise of any of these powers may reduce the amount of premium which a member is allowed to accept for its account in an underwriting year and/or increase a member's costs of doing business at Lloyd's. As a consequence, the member's ability to achieve an anticipated return on capital during that year may be compromised.
Each syndicate is required to submit a business plan to Lloyd's on an annual basis, which is subject to the review and approval of the Lloyd's Franchise Board. The Franchise Board is the managing agents' principal interface with the Council of Lloyd's. The main goal of the Franchise Board is to seek to create and maintain a commercial environment at Lloyd's in which underwriting risk is prudently managed while providing maximum long-term returns to capital providers.
Lloyd's syndicates are treated as "annual ventures" and members' participation on syndicates may change from underwriting year to underwriting year. Ordinarily, a syndicate will accept business over the course of one calendar year (an underwriting year of account), which will remain open for a further two calendar years before being closed by means of "reinsurance to close". An underwriting year may be reinsured to close by the next underwriting year of the same syndicate or by an underwriting year of a different syndicate. Prior to 2005, the London market operated according to a three-year accounting cycle so that members were not able to distribute profits made in an underwriting year until it had been reinsured to close, usually at the end of three years. Since then, provided that certain solvency requirements are met, underwriting profits may be distributed in part before the year has been reinsured to close. Once an underwriting year has been reinsured to close, 
25

Lloyd's will release the Funds at Lloyd's provided that they are not required to support open underwriting years or to meet a loss made on the closed underwriting year. If reinsurance to close cannot be obtained at the end of an underwriting year's third open year (either at all, or on terms that the managing agent considers to be acceptable on behalf of the members participating on that underwriting year), then the managing agent must determine that the underwriting year will remain open. If the managing agent determines to keep the underwriting year open, then the underwriting year of account will be considered to be in run-off, and the Funds at Lloyd's of the participating members will continue to be held by Lloyd's to support their continuing liabilities unless the members can demonstrate that their Funds at Lloyd's are in excess of the amount required to be held in relation to that year.
The reinsurance to close of an underwriting year does not discharge participating members from the insurance liabilities they incurred during that year. Rather, it provides them with a full indemnity from the members participating in the reinsuring underwriting year in respect of those liabilities. Therefore, even after all the underwriting years in which a member has participated have been reinsured to close, the member is required to stay in existence and to remain a non-underwriting member of Lloyd's. Accordingly, although Lloyd's will release members' Funds at Lloyd's, there nevertheless continues to be an administrative and financial burden for corporate members between the time of the reinsurance to close of the underwriting years on which they participated and the time that their insurance obligations are entirely extinguished. This includes the completion of financial accounts in accordance with the U.K. Companies Act 2006 and the submission of an annual compliance declaration to Lloyd's.
Underwriting losses incurred by a syndicate during an underwriting year must be paid according to the links in the Lloyd's chain of security. Claims must be funded first from the member's (or members') premiums trust fund(s) (which are held under the control of the syndicate's managing agent), second from a cash call made to the syndicate's member(s) and third from the member's (or members') Funds at Lloyd's. In the event that any member is unable to pay its debts owed to policyholders from these assets, such debts may be paid by the Lloyd's New Central Fund.
Syndicate 5151's contribution to the Lloyd's New Central Fund, which is available to satisfy claims if a member of Lloyd's is unable to meet its obligation to policyholders and is funded annually by members, was determined by Lloyd's to be 0.35% of Syndicate 5151's written premiums with respect to 2016 (2015 - 0.5%). In addition, the Council of Lloyd's has the power to call on members to make an additional contribution to the New Central Fund of up to 3% for 2016 (2015 - 3%) of their underwriting capacity each year should it decide that such additional contributions are necessary.
Lloyd's also imposes other charges on its members and the syndicates on which they participate, including an annual subscription charge of 0.45% (2015 - 0.5%) of written premiums and an overseas business charge, levied as a percentage of gross international premiums (defined as business outside the U.K. and the Channel Islands), with the percentage depending on the type of business written. Lloyd's also has the power to impose additional charges under Lloyd's Powers of Charging Byelaw.
Solvency Requirements
The solvency requirements applicable to insurance companies domiciled in the EU are primarily derived from the requirements of the Solvency II Directive. The Directive introducing Solvency II came into force on January 6, 2010 and Member States were required to transpose the new regime by March 31, 2015. The Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EC) has been subsequently amended (by the Second Solvency II Quick Fix Directive (2013/58/EU) and the Omnibus II Directive (2014/51/EU)) and references to Solvency II here are to the Directive as amended. The Solvency II regime came into effect and firms are required to operate subject to it with effect from January 1, 2016. 
The objective of Solvency II is to establish a solvency system that is better matched to the true risks of insurers, enabling supervisors to protect policyholders' interests as effectively as possible and in accordance with common principles across the EU. It specifies a range of capital requirements, such as the minimum capital requirement ("MCR") and the SCR. Additionally, it establishes governance and risk management requirements, including but not limited to the following, an own risk and solvency assessment, a supervisory review process, disclosure and reporting requirements, and the regular supervisory report. 
Solvency II is broadly structured according to three "pillars", which group the Solvency II requirements into three main areas that cover different aspects of the regime (and is in this respect similar to the Basel II Capital Accord). The Pillars are broadly: 
•Pillar 1: financial requirements;
•Pillar 2: governance and risk-management requirements, and supervisory review; and
•Pillar 3: disclosure and reporting requirements.
26

In terms of Pillar 1, Solvency II, sets out a number of capital requirements, such as an own funds requirement (including prescribing the type and nature of capital which is eligible to meet these capital requirements). It also specifies the obligation to have an MCR (i.e., the minimum amount of capital needed to be held by a firm and that is also part of the PRA's General Prudential Sourcebook) and the SCR (the risk based level of capital required to be held by a firm). Pillar 1 further sets out the various requirements in how a firm's capital is to be assessed, including the application of the standard and internal models and the manner in which assets and liabilities are to be valued. Significant elements of the Solvency II regime are similar in effect to the prior regime that operated in the U.K., pursuant to the Prudential Sourcebooks.
Under Pillar 2, firms must develop and embed systems to identify, measure and proactively manage risks. In particular, it sets out the own risk and solvency assessment ("ORSA"), which broadly requires a firm to assess (in a proportionate manner) all of the current and possible future risks it has within its business to determine the level of capital (own funds) needed to mitigate these risks. 
Pillar 3 sets out a number of requirements on firms in relation to public disclosure and regulatory reporting. For example, firms are required to publish an annual report that sets out their solvency and financial condition. This is the firm's solvency and financial condition report ("SFCR") and must, inter alia, include information on the firm's capital management, its systems of governance and a description of each category of risk the firm is exposed to. The rationale behind this and the other disclosure and reporting requirements, set out in Pillar 3 is to ensure market discipline and provide supervisors with information required to carry out their functions. 
The legislation implementing the final version of the Solvency II Directive has now replaced the solvency requirements described in the first three paragraphs of this section with effect from January 1, 2016. The PRA has an ongoing program of work including the approval of internal and standard models and the determination of the SCR and MCR applicable for each authorized insurer. Detailed implementation and the publication of replacement sourcebooks continue. Endurance U.K. has agreed its regulatory capital requirements under Solvency II with the PRA and continues to cooperate fully with the PRA in connection with the introduction of the Solvency II regime.
Restrictions on Dividend Payments
U.K. company law prohibits each of Endurance U.K., ECCL, EGWRAL and Endurance at Lloyd's from declaring a dividend to its shareholders unless it has "profits available for distribution". The determination of whether a company has profits available for distribution is based on its accumulated realized profits less its accumulated realized losses. While the United Kingdom insurance regulatory laws impose no statutory restrictions on a general insurer's ability to declare a dividend, the PRA strictly controls the maintenance of each insurance company's solvency margin within its jurisdiction. The PRA's rules require notification to the PRA of any proposed or actual payment of a dividend. Any such payment or proposal could result in regulatory intervention. In addition, the PRA requires authorized insurance companies to notify the PRA in advance of any significant dividend payment.
Reporting Requirements
U.K. insurance companies must prepare their financial statements under the Companies Act 2006 (as amended), which requires the filing with Companies House of audited financial statements and related reports. In addition, U.K. insurance companies are required to prepare and submit annual returns to the PRA, together with audited annual financial statements. The PRA uses the annual return to assist it in monitoring the solvency of an insurance company. The directors of an insurance company are required to sign a certificate to be submitted with the annual return, which includes a statement that the directors are satisfied that the company has complied in all material respects with certain parts of the PRA Handbook, in particular, the parts dealing with systems and controls and principles for businesses.
Supervision of Management
The PRA and the FCA closely supervise the management of insurance companies through the approved persons regime, by which any appointment of persons to perform certain specified "controlled functions" within a regulated entity must be approved by the regulators. Both regulators have responsibility for applications under the approved persons regime and the list of controlled functions has been split between the regulators. Which regulator has responsibility for approving an application will depend on the controlled function position. Following their authorization, there are codes of practice issued by the PRA and FCA with which approved persons are expected to comply. A new senior managers regime has been put into place, pursuant to which the senior management of Endurance U.K. and Endurance at Lloyd's are regulated. While the new regime has some impact on the governance of these entities, it is not currently considered that it will materially change the overall level of supervision.
27

Change of Control
The FSMA regulates the acquisition of control of any U.K. insurance company authorized under the FSMA. Any company or individual that (together with any person acting in concert with it or him) directly or indirectly acquires 10% or more of the shares in a U.K. authorized insurance company or its parent company, or is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of 10% or more of the voting power in such authorized insurance company or its parent company, would be considered to have acquired control of the authorized insurance company for the purposes of the relevant legislation, as would a person who had significant influence over the management of such authorized insurance company or its parent company by virtue of his shareholding or voting power in either company. A purchaser of 10% or more of the ordinary shares would therefore be considered to have acquired control of Endurance U.K. A slightly different threshold applies to EGWRAL because it only distributes insurance products. A new controller must seek consent from the FCA before acquiring 20% of the shares in EGWRAL or a parent.
Under FSMA, any person proposing to acquire control over a U.K. authorized insurance company must give prior notification to the PRA (or the FCA, if the company is only a distributor) of their intention to do so together with certain prescribed information and obtain the prior approval of the PRA or FCA, as applicable, to the change of control. Where a notification is made to the PRA, the PRA is required to consult with the FCA and the FCA may require the PRA to reject the application or impose conditions if the FCA has concerns about money laundering or terrorist financing. The PRA (or the FCA, if the company is only a distributor) has 60 working days to make a decision following its acknowledgment of the complete application. The duration of this period may be stopped by the PRA (or the FCA, if the company is only a distributor) once, to request further information, for a maximum of 20 days (30 days for non-EU applicants). Although the regulators may make further information requests, this does not "stop the clock", meaning that the regulators have a maximum of 80 working days to consider a complete application from an EU applicant (90 for a non-EU applicant). The regulators may only object to a particular acquisition on the basis of certain specified "assessment criteria" relating to the reputation and financial soundness of the acquirer, the reputation and experience of those who will direct the regulated business, compliance with prudential requirements and any suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing. In addition to these requirements, the relevant firm itself is obliged to notify its regulator(s) if it is aware of the proposed acquisition, and may be subject to regulatory enforcement action if it fails to do so.
Intervention and Enforcement
The PRA and the FCA have extensive powers to intervene in the affairs of an authorized person, culminating in the ultimate sanction of the removal of authorization to carry on a regulated activity. The FSMA imposes statutory obligations on the PRA and the FCA to monitor compliance with the requirements imposed by the FSMA, and to enforce the provisions of the FSMA related rules made by the PRA and FCA. The PRA and the FCA have the power, among other things, to enforce and take disciplinary measures in respect of breaches of rules made by them. The FCA also has the power to prosecute criminal offences arising under the FSMA, and to prosecute insider dealing under Part V of the Criminal Justice Act of 1993, and breaches of money laundering regulations. The FCA's stated policy is to pursue criminal prosecution in all appropriate cases.
Passporting
European Union directives and treaties allow Endurance U.K. to conduct business in European Union states other than the United Kingdom in compliance with the scope of its U.K. permissions without the necessity of additional licensing or authorization in other European Union jurisdictions. This ability to operate in other jurisdictions of the European Union on the basis of home state authorization and supervision is sometimes referred to as passporting. Insurers may operate outside their home member state either on a services basis or on an establishment basis. Operating on a services basis means that a company can conduct permitted business in the host state without having a physical presence there, while operating on an establishment basis means that the company has a branch or physical presence in the host state.
In both cases, the prudential regulation of the company remains the responsibility of its home state regulator, and not of local regulatory authorities, although the company nonetheless may have to comply with certain local rules reserved to the "host state" (the state into which the services are being provided or in which the branch is being established). In addition to European Union member states, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein (members of the broader European Economic Area) are jurisdictions in which this passporting framework applies.
U.S. Regulation
The Company's U.S. operating subsidiaries are domiciled in the State of Delaware, with the exception of American Agri-Business, which is domiciled in the State of Texas. In addition, one of the Company's U.S. operating subsidiaries, Endurance Risk Solutions, is commercially domiciled in the State of California.
28

Much of state insurance regulation follows model statutes or regulations developed or amended by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") that is comprised of the insurance commissioners of each U.S. jurisdiction. The NAIC re-examines and amends existing model laws and regulations (including holding company regulations) as it deems appropriate in addition to determining whether new ones are needed.
NAIC model laws and regulations are merely recommended laws and regulations relating to the regulation of insurance in the U.S. that become effective only when enacted into law or promulgated as a regulation in a state, often with state-specific changes. Some model laws and regulations have been enacted in very few states and some model laws and regulations have been enacted in all states in some form or another.
Insurance Holding Company Regulation of Endurance Holdings
Endurance Holdings, Endurance U.S. Holdings Corp. and the Company's U.S. operating subsidiaries are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the States of Delaware, Texas and California, the states in which the Company's U.S. operating subsidiaries are organized and domiciled or commercially domiciled. These laws generally require, among other things, each insurance company directly or indirectly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance regulator in the insurance company's state of domicile and state, if any, in which it is commercially domiciled and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system. Generally, all material transactions among companies in the holding company system involving the Company's U.S. operating subsidiaries, including sales, loans, reinsurance agreements, service agreements, dividend payments and certain transactions within the insurance holding company system must be fair and, if material or of a specified category, require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by the insurance regulator of the state in which the involved U.S. operating subsidiary is domiciled and commercially domiciled.
The NAIC, as part of its solvency modernization initiative, has engaged in a concerted effort to strengthen the ability of U.S. state insurance regulators to monitor U.S. insurance holding company groups. The NAIC’s solvency modernization initiative, among other things, aims to expand the authority and focus of state insurance regulators to encompass U.S. insurance holding company systems at the group level. The holding company reform efforts at the NAIC culminated in December 2010 in the adoption of significant amendments to the NAIC's Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (the "Model Holding Company Act") and its Insurance Holding Company System Model Regulation (the "Model Holding Company Regulation"). Among other things, the revised Model Holding Company Act and Model Holding Company Regulation explicitly address "enterprise" risk – the risk that an activity, circumstance, event or series of events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that, if not remedied promptly, is likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole – and require annual reporting of potential enterprise risk as well as access to information to allow the state insurance regulator to assess such risk. In addition, the Model Holding Company Act amendments include a requirement to the effect that any person divesting control over an insurer must provide 30 days' notice to the regulator and the insurer (with an exception for cases where a Form A is being filed). The amendments direct the domestic state insurance regulator to determine those instances in which a divesting person will be required to file for and obtain approval of the transaction.
In June 2011, Texas became one of the first states to adopt the principal components of the amended Model Holding Company Act. The related amendments to the Texas insurance holding company act depart somewhat from the Model Holding Company Act in including a phase-in of the enterprise risk annual reporting requirement based on the volume of total direct or assumed annual premiums written by the insurer during the preceding 12-month period. Ultimate controlling persons of insurers with direct written and assumed premiums of more than $1 billion but less than $5 billion during the preceding 12-month period were required to file their first enterprise risk report with the first annual registration statement that became due after January 1, 2014. In 2016, the Texas Department of Insurance amended its insurance regulations that address the information to be provided in connection with the proposed acquisition of control of a Texas domestic insurance company. The amendments were adopted to maintain the confidentiality of enterprise risk information that is not required by the acquisition statutes as part of the acquisition process.
In January 2013, California adopted the principal components of the amended Model Holding Company Act. Under the California amendments, the enterprise risk report is to be filed with the lead state commissioner, when applicable, of the insurance holding company system as determined by the procedures within the Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by the NAIC, and if the California Commissioner of Insurance is not the lead state commissioner of the insurance holding company system, a copy is required to be provided to the California Commissioner of Insurance if the insurance holding company system has an insurer domiciled in the State of California. The first annual enterprise risk report was required to be filed with the insurer's first registration statement filed after July 1, 2013.
29

In August 2014, Delaware adopted the principal components of the amended Model Holding Company Act. Under the Delaware amendments, the ultimate controlling person of insurers subject to registration is required to file an annual enterprise risk report with the lead state commissioner, when applicable, of the insurance holding company system as determined by the procedures within the Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by the NAIC. The first enterprise risk report was required 60 days following the effective date of the Delaware amendments. 
In December 2014, the NAIC adopted additional revisions to the Model Holding Company Act, updating the model to clarify the group-wide supervisor for a defined class of internationally active insurance groups. The revisions also outline the process for determining the lead state for domestic insurance groups, outline the activities the commissioner may engage in as group-wide supervisor and extend confidentiality protections to cover information received in the course of group-wide supervision. The 2014 revisions to the Model Holding Company Act have been adopted in Delaware and California.
In 2012, the NAIC adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ("ORSA") Model Act (the "ORSA Model Act"), which requires domestic insurers to maintain a risk management framework and establishes a legal requirement for domestic insurers to conduct an ORSA in accordance with the NAIC's ORSA Guidance Manual. The ORSA Model Act provides that domestic insurers, or their insurance group, must regularly conduct an ORSA consistent with a process comparable to the ORSA Guidance Manual process. The ORSA Model Act also provides that, no more than once a year, an insurer's domiciliary regulator may request that an insurer submit an ORSA summary report, or any combination of reports that together contain the information described in the ORSA Guidance Manual, with respect to the insurer and/or the insurance group of which it is a member. If and when the ORSA Model Act is adopted by a particular state, the ORSA Model Act would impose more extensive filing requirements on parents and other affiliates of domestic insurers. Effective January 1, 2015, each of California and Delaware adopted the ORSA Model Act. In May 2015, Texas adopted its version of the ORSA Model Act, which became effective immediately. In 2015, the Company filed an ORSA with the Delaware Department of Insurance as an insurance group including Endurance Assurance, Endurance American, Endurance American Specialty, Endurance Risk Solutions and American Agri-Business, all of its U.S. operating insurance companies. 
Additionally, in response to the growing threat of cyber-attacks in the insurance industry, certain jurisdictions have begun to consider new cybersecurity measures, including the adoption of cybersecurity regulations which, among other things, would require insurance companies to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program and implement and maintain cybersecurity policies and procedures. Notably, the NAIC has begun, over the past year, to draft a new Insurance Data Security Model Law (the "Cyber Model Law"), the drafting process for which is still on-going.
Changes of Control
Before a person can acquire control of a U.S. domestic insurer (or reinsurer), prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the insurer (or reinsurer) is domiciled and, when applicable, commercially domiciled, or the acquiror must make a disclaimer of control filing with the insurance department of such state(s) and obtain approval thereon. Prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer (or reinsurer), the domiciliary (or commercial domiciliary) state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the proposed acquiror, the integrity and management of the acquiror's board of directors and executive officers, the acquiror's plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control.
Generally, state insurance statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing, ten percent or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer. This statutory presumption of control may be rebutted by a showing that control does not exist in fact. The state regulators, however, may find that "control" exists in circumstances in which a person owns or controls less than ten percent of voting securities. Because a person acquiring ten percent or more of Endurance Holdings' ordinary shares would indirectly acquire the same percentage of common stock of Endurance Holdings' U.S. operating subsidiaries, the U.S. insurance change of control laws would likely apply to such a transaction. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of Endurance Holdings, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of the shareholders of Endurance Holdings might consider to be desirable.
In addition, many state insurance laws require prior notification of state insurance regulators of a change in control of a non-domiciliary insurance company doing business in that state. While these pre-notification statutes do not authorize the state insurance regulators to disapprove the change in control, they authorize regulatory action in the affected state if particular conditions exist such as undue market concentration. Any future transactions that would constitute a change in control of our insurance subsidiaries may require prior notification in those states that have adopted pre-acquisition notification laws.
30

The Model Holding Company Act amendments adopted by Texas alter the method by which a person can "disclaim" control over an insurer where a presumption of control exists. Historically under the Model Holding Company Act, a disclaimer of control was considered effective when filed; no affirmative approval from the state insurance regulator was required, and the regulator could disapprove a disclaimer only upon a notice and hearing. Under the amendments to the Model Holding Company Act adopted in Texas, a disclaimer is deemed effective after 60 days unless disallowed prior to that time, and disallowance does not require a notice or hearing. The Texas amendments expressly provide, however, that the Texas Commissioner of Insurance (the "Texas Commissioner") may disallow a disclaimer at any time if the Texas Commissioner determines that the disclaimer is incomplete or inaccurate or is no longer accurate.
Under the 2011 amendments to the Texas insurance holding company act, a "divesting person" must have the "divestiture" approved by the Texas Commissioner. Unlike the Model Holding Company Act amendments, which require the confidential notice of proposed divestiture at least 30 days prior to the cessation of control, the Texas amendments require a divesting person to file a notice of its proposed divestiture with the Texas Commissioner at least 60 days before the cessation of control. In considering whether to approve or deny the divestiture, the Texas Commissioner will consider whether it may jeopardize financial stability of the insurer or prejudice the interest of the insurer’s policyholders or other claimants.
Similar to the Model Holding Company Act amendments, under the amendments adopted in California and Delaware, any controlling person of a domestic (or commercially domiciled) insurer must file a confidential notice of proposed divestiture at least 30 days prior to the cessation of control. The California and Delaware amendments provide that the California Commissioner of Insurance (the "California Commissioner") and the Delaware Commissioner of Insurance, respectively, will determine those instances in which the party or parties seeking to divest a controlling interest in an insurer will be required to file for and obtain approval of the transaction. Under the California amendments, the California Commissioner may disallow a disclaimer at any time if the California Commissioner determines that the disclaimer is incomplete or inaccurate. Under the amendments to the Model Holding Company Act adopted in Delaware, a disclaimer is deemed effective after 30 days unless disallowed prior to that time, and, in the event of disallowance, the disclaiming party may request a hearing.
State Insurance Regulation of the Company's U.S. Operating Subsidiaries
State insurance authorities have broad regulatory powers with respect to various aspects of the business of the Company's U.S. operating subsidiaries including: licensing to transact business, admittance of assets to statutory surplus, regulating unfair trade and claims practices, establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards (including risk-based capital standards), establishing credit for reinsurance requirements, approval of policy forms and dates, and regulating investments, dividends and transactions between an insurer and its affiliates. With respect to direct insurance business, states may also regulate rates and forms used by insurers admitted to transact business within a given state jurisdiction and the marketplace conduct of such insurers. With respect to reinsurance, other than bulk reinsurance arrangements, the terms and conditions of reinsurance agreements between unaffiliated parties generally are not subject to regulation by any U.S. state insurance department with respect to rates or policy terms.
State insurance laws and regulations require each of the Company's U.S. operating subsidiaries to file financial statements with insurance departments everywhere it is licensed, authorized or accredited to conduct insurance business and the operations of the Company's U.S. operating subsidiaries are subject to examination by those departments at any time. The Company's U.S. operating subsidiaries prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by these departments. State insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the books and records, financial reporting, policy filings and market conduct of insurance companies domiciled or authorized to transact business in their states, generally once every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC. State and federal insurance and securities regulatory authorities and other state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general also occasionally make inquiries and conduct examinations or investigations regarding the compliance of our companies, as well as other companies in our industry, with insurance, securities and other laws.
In general, such state regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than shareholders. Under Delaware, Texas and California insurance laws, the Company's U.S. operating subsidiaries may only pay dividends to their respective parent companies out of earned surplus. In Delaware, Texas and California, earned surplus is defined as an amount equal to the unassigned funds of an insurer as set forth in the most recent annual statement of the insurer submitted to the applicable state insurance regulator, including all or part of the surplus arising from unrealized capital gains or revaluation of assets.
In addition, the Company's U.S. operating subsidiaries may not, without the approval or non-disapproval of the applicable domestic (or commercially domestic) state insurance regulator, declare or pay any dividend (referred to as an extraordinary dividend), together with all dividends declared or distributed by it within the preceding twelve months, if the dividend exceeds the greater of:
31


1. | ten percent of its policyholders surplus as of the 31st day of December of the preceding year; or


2. | the statutory net income (under Texas and California insurance laws), not including realized capital gains (under Delaware insurance laws) for the 12-month period ending, for the preceding calendar year (the 31st day of December next preceding).

Any dividend paid by any one of the Company's U.S. operating subsidiaries must first be paid to its immediate parent company. If the parent company is also an insurer, as is the case with Endurance American, Endurance American Specialty and Endurance Risk Solutions, the parent company or companies must also meet their own dividend eligibility requirements set forth above in order to pass along any dividends received from subsidiary insurance companies.
The dividend limitations imposed by Delaware, Texas and California insurance laws are based on the statutory financial results of the Company’s U.S. operating subsidiaries determined by using statutory accounting practices which differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The significant differences relate to deferred acquisition expenses, deferred income taxes, required investment reserves, reserve calculation assumptions and surplus notes. At December 31, 2016, of the Company's U.S. operating subsidiaries, only American Agri-Business Insurance Company ("American Agri-Business") had earned surplus, and therefore, only American Agri-Business could declare or distribute dividends in 2017 without prior regulatory approval.
Developments at the Federal Level
The U.S. federal government's oversight of the insurance industry was expanded under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"). Prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act in July 2010, the U.S. federal government's regulation of the insurance industry was essentially limited to certain insurance products, such as flood insurance, multi-peril crop insurance and reinsurance of losses from terrorism. As part of the overall federal financial regulatory reform package contained in the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress has legislated reforms in the reinsurance and surplus lines sectors.
Under reinsurance credit rules established under the Dodd-Frank Act, a U.S. ceding insurer need not satisfy the reinsurance credit rules of any nondomestic state if the following two conditions are met: 1) the ceding insurer's domestic state is NAIC-accredited or has financial solvency requirements substantially similar to the requirements necessary for NAIC accreditation, and 2) the ceding insurer's domestic state recognizes credit for reinsurance for its ceded risk.
The Dodd-Frank Act also established the Federal Insurance Office (the "FIO") in the U.S. Department of the Treasury and vested the FIO with the authority to monitor all aspects of the insurance sector, monitor the extent to which traditionally underserved communities and consumers have access to affordable non-health insurance products, and to represent the United States on prudential aspects of international insurance matters, including at the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (the "IAIS"). In addition, the FIO serves as an advisory member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, assists the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury with administration of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, and advises the Secretary of the U. S. Department of the Treasury on important national and international insurance matters. In addition, the FIO has the ability to recommend to the Financial Stability Oversight Council the designation of an insurer as "systemically significant" and therefore subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company.
In limited circumstances, the FIO can declare a state insurance law or regulation "preempted," but this can be done only after extensive consultation with state insurance regulators, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and key insurance industry players (in trade associations representing insurers and intermediaries). Additionally, the FIO must publish a notice regarding the basis for the preemption in the Federal Register, allowing a reasonable opportunity for comments. The FIO cannot preempt state antitrust laws governing rate making, underwriting, sales practices or coverage requirements. No later than September 30th of each year, the FIO must submit an annual report to Congress explaining any use of the preemption authority during the prior year.
In addition, a number of federal laws affect and apply to the insurance industry, including various privacy laws and the economic and trade sanctions implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. OFAC maintains and enforces economic sanctions against certain foreign countries and groups and prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in certain transactions with certain persons or entities. OFAC has imposed civil penalties on persons, including insurance and reinsurance companies, arising from violations of its economic sanctions program.
32

On December 12, 2013, the FIO submitted a report to Congress as required under the Dodd-Frank Act on improving U.S. insurance regulation (the "Modernization Report"). The Modernization Report concludes that the federal government should continue its involvement in insurance regulation, emphasizing the need for improved uniformity and efficiency in the U.S. insurance regulatory system, but that the current "hybrid" state and federal regulatory system should remain in place. The Modernization Report also recommends certain steps that should be taken to modernize and improve the U.S. insurance regulatory system through a combination of actions to be taken by the state and federal governments. Many of the recommendations in the Modernization Report are subject to NAIC initiatives. As the FIO does not have regulatory authority, the recommendations in its report could be viewed as advisory in nature. Most suggestions for U.S. federal standards and involvement in insurance regulation would require U.S. Congressional action. In its 2016 Annual Report on the Insurance Industry released on September 30, 2016, the FIO continued to highlight perceived shortcomings in the state-based insurance regulatory system, advocate for improved uniformity across a number of insurance regulatory issues and recommend increased federal involvement in certain areas of insurance regulation.
On November 20, 2015, the FIO and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced their intention to exercise their authority under the Dodd-Frank Act to negotiate a "covered agreement" with the European Union. After a number of private negotiating sessions, on January 13, 2017, the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative notified Congress that they had completed negotiations with the European Union for the covered agreement, which addressed reinsurance, insurance group supervision and the exchange of information between insurance supervisors. Significantly for state insurance regulation, the covered agreement contemplates that in the U.S. it will be implemented by the states by incorporating its standards into state law, with the FIO authorized to preempt offending state law if the law of a particular state is not amended to incorporate such standards and disadvantages a European Union insurer.
With respect to reinsurance, under the covered agreement, both the U.S. and the European Union agreed that their supervisory authorities will not impose reinsurance collateral requirements or "local presence" requirements on a reinsurer domiciled in (or with a head office in) the other's territory that are less favorable than collateral or local presence requirements applied to a domestic reinsurer. However, the collateral or local presence provisions apply only if the insurer or reinsurer satisfies certain conditions and standards, including among others, minimum capital and risk-based capital, confirmation of financial condition by the reinsurer's domestic regulator and claims payment standards. As discussed above, if implemented, the covered agreement could preempt the credit for reinsurance laws in jurisdictions that have not amended their credit for reinsurance laws to allow reduced collateral requirements for certified reinsurers.
As for group supervision, the covered agreement seeks to clarify that U.S. and European Union insurers operating in a jurisdiction that is a party to the covered agreement will be subject to worldwide prudential insurance group oversight only by the supervisors in their home jurisdiction.
It is unclear whether the U.S. Congress or the Trump administration will support the covered agreement (although Congress does not have the ability to veto the covered agreement, it retains the authority to enact legislation that could block the covered agreement from taking effect). In addition, the European Council and the European Parliament must each adopt decisions approving the covered agreement before it can become effective.
Any additional regulations established as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act or actions in response to the Modernization Report could increase costs or compliance or lead to disciplinary action. In addition, legislation has been introduced from time to time that, if enacted, could result in the federal government assuming a more direct role in the regulation of the insurance industry, including federal licensing in addition to or in lieu of state licensing and requiring reinsurance for natural catastrophes. We are unable to predict whether any legislation will be enacted or any regulations will be adopted, or the effect any such developments could have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Risk-Based Capital Regulations
The insurance laws of Delaware and Texas require that insurers report their risk-based capital (“RBC”) based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. The formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer, including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk and business risk. The state insurance departments of Delaware and Texas use the formula only as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possibly inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank insurers generally. Insurance laws impose broad confidentiality requirements on those engaged in the insurance business (including insurers, agents, brokers and others) and on the state insurance departments as to the use and publication of RBC data. The insurance departments of Delaware and Texas have explicit regulatory authority to require various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital does not exceed certain RBC levels.

IRIS Tests
The NAIC has developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System ("IRIS") to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of U.S. insurance companies and identifying companies requiring special attention or action. For IRIS ratio purposes, our U.S. operating subsidiaries submit data to the NAIC on an annual basis. The NAIC analyzes this data using prescribed financial data ratios. A ratio falling outside the prescribed "usual range" is not considered a failing result. Rather, unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. In many cases, it is not unusual for financially sound companies to have one or more ratios that fall outside the usual range.
Regulators typically investigate or monitor an insurance company if its IRIS ratios fall outside the prescribed usual range for four or more of the ratios, but each state has the right to inquire about any ratios falling outside the usual range. The inquiries made by state insurance regulators into an insurance company's IRIS ratios can take various forms.
Statutory Accounting Practices
Statutory accounting practices, or "SAP," are a basis of accounting developed to assist U.S. insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies. It is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer's surplus to policyholders. Accordingly, statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer’s domiciliary state.
U.S. GAAP concerns an insurer's solvency, but it also concerns other financial measurements, such as income and cash flows. Accordingly, U.S. GAAP gives more consideration to appropriate matching of revenue and expenses and accounting for management's stewardship of assets than does SAP. As a direct result, different assets and liabilities and different amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP as opposed to SAP.
Statutory accounting practices established by the NAIC and adopted, in part, by the Delaware and Texas insurance regulators, determine, among other things, the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of Endurance Holdings' U.S. insurance company subsidiaries and thus determine, in part, the amount of funds they have available to pay dividends to their respective parent companies.
Effective with the annual reporting period ended December 31, 2010, the NAIC adopted revisions to the Annual Financial Reporting, or the Model Audit Rule, related to auditor independence, corporate governance and internal control over financial reporting. The adopted revisions required that we file reports with state insurance regulators regarding our assessment of internal control over financial reporting.
Insurance Guaranty Associations
Each state has insurance guaranty association laws that require insurance companies doing business in the state to participate in various types of guaranty associations or other similar arrangements. The laws are designed to protect policyholders from losses under insurance policies issued by insurance companies that become impaired or insolvent. Typically, these associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on member insurers on the basis of the member insurer’s proportionate share of the business in the relevant jurisdiction in the lines of business in which the impaired or insolvent insurer is engaged. Some jurisdictions permit members insurers to recover assessments that they paid through full or partial premium tax offsets, usually over a period of years.
International Developments
The IAIS has proposed a common framework for the supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups ("IAIGs"), which is scheduled to be effective in 2019. Under the proposed framework, IAIGs would be supervised on a group-wide basis across national boundaries and each IAIG would be required to conduct its own risk and solvency assessment to monitor and manage its overall solvency. The IAIS is also developing a risk-based global Insurance Capital Standard ("ICS"), which would apply to IAIGs. In addition, the Financial Stability Board is pursuing enhanced group supervisory and capital requirements for Global Systemically Important Insurers ("G-SIIs"). Finally, Insurance Core Principles ("ICPs"), another set of supervisory requirements under development by the IAIS, would apply to all insurers and insurance groups, regardless of size or systemic importance. These frameworks may influence applicable capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate in the future, potentially leading to an increase in our capital requirements.
Additionally, on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which a majority voted for the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union. As a result of this vote, negotiations are expected to commence to determine the terms of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, as well as its relationship with the European Union going forward (“Brexit”). Brexit has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global stock markets and

currency exchange rates, which could increase the volatility of, or reduce, the Company’s results in particular periods or over time. Higher levels of political and market turmoil could persist until some clarity emerges around the United Kingdom’s exit process from the European Union and the impact of Brexit on the economies of the other European countries. The geopolitical impacts of Brexit are unknown and may adversely affect long-term European and global economic growth and forecasts, which could adversely impact the demand for the Company’s products. Brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and differing laws and regulations between the United Kingdom and the European Union. These uncertainties could affect the operations, strategic position or results of brokers, insurers or reinsurers with whom the Company does business. Any of these potential effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Operations of Endurance U.K. and Endurance Bermuda
Endurance U.K. and Endurance Bermuda are not admitted to do business in any state in the United States. Insurance laws of each state of the United States and of many other countries generally restrict or prohibit the sale of insurance and reinsurance within their jurisdictions by non-admitted alien insurers and reinsurers such as Endurance U.K. and Endurance Bermuda.
In addition to the regulatory requirements imposed by the jurisdictions in which they are licensed, reinsurers' business operations are affected by regulatory requirements in various states of the United States governing "credit for reinsurance" that are imposed on ceding companies in these states. In general, a ceding company that obtains reinsurance from a reinsurer that is licensed, accredited or approved by the state of domicile of the ceding company is permitted to reflect in the ceding company's statutory financial statements a credit in an aggregate amount equal to the liability for unearned premiums (which are that portion of written premiums which applies to the remaining portion of the policy period) and loss reserves and loss expense reserves ceded to the reinsurer. In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, only a ceding company's state of domicile can dictate credit for reinsurance requirements. Other states in which a ceding company is licensed are no longer able to impose their own credit for reinsurance laws on ceding companies domiciled in other states.
As stated above, Endurance U.K. and Endurance Bermuda are not licensed, accredited or approved in any state in the United States. The great majority of states, however, permit a credit to statutory surplus resulting from reinsurance obtained from a non-licensed or non-accredited reinsurer to be offset to the extent that the reinsurer provides a letter of credit or other acceptable security arrangement. A few states do not allow credit for reinsurance ceded to non-licensed or non-accredited reinsurers except in certain limited circumstances and others impose additional requirements that make it difficult to become accredited.
Effective January 1, 2015, the NAIC placed Bermuda, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Ireland and Switzerland on the NAIC List of Qualified Jurisdictions. These designations are part of continuing efforts to implement a "certified reinsurer" concept that allows highly rated reinsurers, domiciled in qualified jurisdictions, to take advantage of reduced reinsurance collateral requirements under the NAIC's revised Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Regulations (the "Certified Reinsurer Provisions"). Reinsurers, including Endurance U.K. and Endurance Bermuda, domiciled in any of the seven jurisdictions are eligible to apply to be certified for reduced reinsurance collateral requirements in those U.S. states that have adopted the revised Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Regulations. Thirty-five U.S. states have adopted the revised Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Regulations or some variation thereof. As a result, a non-U.S. reinsurer that has qualified as a certified reinsurer in one of these states is still obligated to post 100% collateral with respect to business assumed from U.S. ceding companies domiciled in the remaining fifteen U.S. jurisdictions. Importantly, the covered agreement with the European Union discussed below, if implemented, could preempt the credit for reinsurance laws in these fifteen remaining jurisdictions with respect to business assumed from an insurer domiciled in any U.S. state.
In 2008, prior to the adoption of Certified Reinsurer Provisions in the NAIC Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Regulations, the Florida insurance regulator adopted similar regulations permitting lower collateral requirements for "eligible" non-U.S.-based reinsurers engaged in the property and casualty insurance business that meet specified standards. Endurance Bermuda was granted eligible reinsurer status by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation in 2012, thereby permitting Florida domiciled ceding companies to take 100% credit in their financial statements for reinsurance provided by Endurance Bermuda. In 2015, Endurance Bermuda established multi-beneficiary reinsurance trusts ("Reinsurance Trusts") domiciled in Delaware as a means of providing statutory credit to Endurance Bermuda's cedants, including those cedants that were clients of Montpelier and had previously obtained statutory credit through Montpelier's Reinsurance Trusts established in New York. In November 2015, the New York Department of Financial Services approved the transfer to the Endurance Bermuda Reinsurance Trusts of all assets in excess of the statutory required minimum amounts held in the Montpelier Reinsurance Trusts. 
Beginning in 2015, Endurance Bermuda applied for certified reinsurer status in certain states that adopted the Certified Reinsurer Provisions. In certain states that have not yet adopted the Certified Reinsurer Provisions or require additional qualifications, Endurance Bermuda has applied for or obtained the requisite qualification necessary to use the Reinsurance 
35

Trusts as a means to allow cedants to take full credit in their financial statements for the reinsurance provided by Endurance Bermuda. 
We do not believe that Endurance U.K. and Endurance Bermuda are in violation of insurance laws of any jurisdiction in the United States or in any other applicable jurisdiction. There can be no assurance however, that inquiries or challenges to Endurance U.K.'s or Endurance Bermuda's insurance or reinsurance activities will not be raised in the future.
Registered Investment Advisor
As a result in a change in its business plans, during 2015, BCML voluntarily terminated its status as a registered investment advisor under the Investment Act of 1940.
Switzerland
In 2008, Endurance Bermuda established a branch in Zurich, Switzerland named Endurance Specialty Insurance Ltd. Pembroke (Bermuda) Zurich Branch. In 2015, Endurance U.K. established a branch in Zurich named Endurance Worldwide Insurance Limited, London, Zurich Branch. Swiss law does not impose additional regulation upon a Swiss branch of a foreign reinsurer.
Singapore
Endurance Specialty Insurance Ltd. Singapore Branch (the "Singapore Branch") is registered under the Singapore Insurance Act as a general insurer as a branch of Endurance Bermuda in Singapore to transact general reinsurance domestically and internationally. The Singapore Branch is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore pursuant to the Insurance Act. The Singapore Branch is also registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority ("ACRA") as a foreign company in Singapore and is regulated under the Companies Act. The Singapore Branch has received approval under a tax incentive scheme set out in the Income Tax Act (and the relevant regulations) which provides for a concessionary corporate tax rate of 10% to be applied on its income from underwriting offshore risks for a period of 10 years from April 2010 to March 2020. During 2015, the Monetary Authority of Singapore conducted an inspection of the Singapore Branch with no material findings reported.
