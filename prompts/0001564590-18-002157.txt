ITEM 1. Business and Properties 
Overview
 We are a growth‑oriented partnership formed by Landmark Dividend LLC (“Landmark” or “Sponsor”) to acquire, own and manage a portfolio of real property interests and infrastructure assets that are leased to companies in the wireless communication, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation industries. In addition, the Partnership owns certain interests in receivables associated with similar assets. The Partnership is a limited partnership organized in the State of Delaware and has been publicly traded since its initial public offering (“IPO”) on November 19, 2014. Our common units are listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol "LMRK". On July 31, 2017, the Partnership completed changes to its organizational structure by transferring substantially all of its assets to a subsidiary, Landmark Infrastructure Inc., a Delaware corporation (“REIT Subsidiary”), which is intended to qualify as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). We intend to continue to own and operate substantially all of our assets through the REIT Subsidiary. These changes are designed to simplify tax reporting for unitholders and intended to broaden the Partnership’s investor base by substantially eliminating unrelated business taxable income allocated by the Partnership to tax-exempt investors, including individuals investing through tax-deferred accounts such as an individual retirement account.
 Our real property interests underlie our tenants’ infrastructure assets, which include freestanding cellular towers and rooftop wireless sites, billboards, wind turbines and solar arrays. These assets are essential to the operations and profitability of our tenants. We seek to acquire real property interests subject to triple net or effectively triple net lease arrangements containing contractual rent increase clauses, or “rent escalators,” which we believe provide us with stable, predictable and growing cash flow.
 Our real property interests consist of a diversified portfolio of long‑term and perpetual easements, tenant lease assignments and fee simple properties located primarily in the United States. These real property interests entitle us to receive rental payments from leases on our 2,239 tenant sites. Approximately 83% of our leased tenant sites are leased to large, publicly traded companies (or their affiliates) that have a national footprint and for our renewable power generation segment includes tenants with power purchase agreements with subsidiaries or affiliates of high credit rated utilities or high quality offtakers. These tenants, which we refer to as our “Tier 1” tenants, are comprised of AT&T Mobility, Sprint, T‑Mobile and Verizon in the wireless carrier industry, American Tower, Crown Castle and SBA Communications in the cellular tower industry, Outfront Media, Clear Channel Outdoor and Lamar Advertising in the outdoor advertising industry and Southern California Edison, Duke Energy and Pacific Gas and Electric in the renewable power generation industry.
 We believe the terms of our tenant lease arrangements provide us with stable, predictable and growing cash flow that will support growing distributions to our unitholders. Substantially all of our tenant lease arrangements are triple net or effectively triple net, meaning that our tenants or the underlying property owners are contractually responsible for property‑level operating expenses, including maintenance capital expenditures, property taxes and insurance. Over 93% of our tenant leases have contractual rent escalators, and some of our tenant leases contain revenue‑sharing provisions in addition to the base monthly or annual rental payments. In addition, we believe the physical infrastructure assets at our tenant sites are essential to the ongoing operations and profitability of our tenants. When combined with the challenges and costs of relocating these infrastructure assets and the key strategic locations of our real property interests, we expect continued high tenant retention and occupancy rates. As of December 31, 2017, we had a 96% occupancy rate, with 2,157 of our 2,239 total available tenant sites leased.
 We benefit significantly from our relationship with Landmark, our sponsor. Landmark, a private company formed in 2010, is one of the largest acquirers of real property interests underlying the operationally essential infrastructure assets in the wireless communication, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation industries. Our initial assets and liabilities were contributed to us from two private investment funds sponsored, managed and controlled by Landmark. As of December 31, 2017, Landmark controlled approximately 700 additional tenant sites through the Remaining Landmark Funds. The Remaining Landmark Funds have granted us a right of first offer on real property interests that they currently own or acquire in the future before selling or transferring those assets to any third party. We refer to these real property interests as the “right of first offer assets.” During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership completed the acquisition of 2, 386 and 401 tenant sites subject to our right of first offer, respectively. See further discussion of the acquisitions in notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information. We believe Landmark’s asset acquisition and management platform will benefit us by providing us with drop‑down acquisition opportunities from Landmark’s substantial and growing acquisition pipeline, as well as the capability to make direct acquisitions from third parties. Please read “Our Relationship with Landmark” and “Infrastructure Development”.
 We conduct business through three reportable business segments: Wireless Communication, Outdoor Advertising and Renewable Power Generation. Our reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. They are commonly managed, as all of these businesses require similar marketing and business strategies. We evaluate our segments based on revenue because substantially all of our tenant lease arrangements are triple net or effectively triple net. We believe this measure provides investors with relevant and useful information because it is presented on an unlevered basis. See Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information on our business segments.

Our Portfolio of Real Property Interests
 Our portfolio of property interests consists primarily of (i) long‑term and perpetual easements combined with lease assignment contracts (which we refer to as our “lease assignments)” (ii) lease assignments without easements and (iii) properties we own in fee simple. In connection with each real property interest, we have also acquired the rights to receive payment under pre‑existing ground leases from property owners, which we refer to as our “tenant leases.” Under our easements, property owners have granted us the right to use and lease the space occupied by our tenants, and when we have not been granted easements, we have acquired economic rights under lease assignments that are substantially similar to the economic rights granted under our easements, including the right to re‑lease the same space if the tenant lease expires or terminates.
 The table below provides an overview of our portfolio of real property interests as of December 31, 2017.

(1) | “Available Tenant Sites” means the number of individual sites that could be leased. For example, if we have an easement on a single rooftop, on which three different tenants can lease space from us, this would be counted as three “tenant sites,” and all three tenant sites would be at a single infrastructure location with the same address.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Assumes the exercise of all remaining renewal options of tenant leases. Assuming no exercise of renewal options, the average remaining lease terms for our wireless communication, outdoor advertising, renewable power generation and total portfolios as of December 31, 2017 were 3.8, 8.8, 18.0 and 5.3 years, respectively.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(4) | Occupancy and average monthly effective rent per tenant site are shown only on an aggregate portfolio basis by industry.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | Represents total monthly revenue excluding the impact of amortization of above and below market lease intangibles divided by the number of leased tenant sites.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(6) | Represents GAAP rental revenue recognized under existing tenant leases for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Excludes interest income on receivables.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(7) | Fee simple ownership and perpetual easements are shown as having a term of 99 years for purposes of calculating the average remaining term.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(8) | Reflects “springing lease agreements” whereby the cancellation or nonrenewal of a tenant lease entitles us to enter into a new ground lease with the property owner (up to the full property interest term) and a replacement tenant lease. The remaining lease assignment term is, therefore, equal to or longer than the remaining lease term. Also represents properties for which the “springing lease” feature has been exercised and has been replaced by a lease for the remaining lease term.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(9) | Excluding perpetual ownership rights, the average remaining property interest term on our tenant sites is approximately 66 years.

Our real property interests underlie a diverse range of tenant structures. We evaluate assets based on a variety of attributes, including, but not limited to, the marketability of the underlying title, the stability of the rental cash flow stream and opportunity for rent increases, tenant quality, the desirability of the structure’s geographic location, the importance of the structure to the ongoing operations and profitability of our tenants and the challenge and costs associated with tenants vacating sites. In certain instances, we lease a tenant site for our tenant’s base station and equipment, but not the tenant’s antenna array located on infrastructure owned by a third party. We refer to this type of arrangement as an “equipment only” lease. Within the wireless communication industry, our tenants’ structure types include rooftop sites, wireless towers (including monopoles, self-supporting towers, stealth towers and guyed towers), other structures (including, for example, water towers and church steeples or commercial properties) and equipment only sites. In the outdoor advertising industry, our tenants’ structure types include both static and digital billboards. Our real property interests in the renewable power generation industry currently underlie wind turbines and solar arrays.
 The table below presents an overview of the structures underlying our real property interests, as of December 31, 2017:

Also includes “springing lease agreements” whereby the cancellation or nonrenewal of a tenant lease entitles us to enter into a new ground lease with the property owner (up to the full term) and a replacement tenant lease. The remaining lease assignment term is, therefore, in many cases, higher than the remaining tenant lease term.

We are geographically diversified with assets primarily located throughout the United States, and no single state accounted for more than 15% of our tenant sites as of December 31, 2017. Additionally, the majority of our wireless communication and outdoor advertising assets are located in major cities, significant intersections, and traffic arteries in the United States that benefit from high urban density, favorable demographic trends, strong traffic counts and strict zoning restrictions with legacy zoning rights (commonly referred to as “grandfather clauses.”) These attributes enhance the long‑term value of our real property interests, as our wireless communication and outdoor advertising tenants are focused on placing their assets in dense areas with large populations and along high‑traffic corridors. Additionally, local zoning regulations often restrict the construction of new cellular towers, rooftop wireless structures and outdoor advertising and billboard structures, creating barriers to entry and a supply shortage. We believe this leads to improved value of our assets and further increases the likelihood for continued high occupancy.

Approximately 67% and 79% of our tenant sites are located in Top‑50 and Top‑100 ranked Basic Trading Areas (“BTA”), respectively, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. We believe our locations in major metropolitan population centers are highly desirable for our tenants in the wireless communication and outdoor advertising industries seeking to reach a large customer base.

Easements and Lease Assignments
 In most locations, our tenant leases were acquired together with an easement granted by the property owner in favor of Landmark, granting us the rights to the tenant site occupied by the tenant under the lease. For our tenant sites that were not accompanied by an easement or purchased in fee, our lease assignments provide us with economic rights that are substantially similar to the economic rights granted under our easements, including the right to re‑lease the same space if the tenant lease expires or terminates. In limited circumstances, we lease the sites from property owners and then sub‑lease those spaces to our tenants.
 The terms of our easements and lease assignments generally range from 15 years to 99 years with certain assets having perpetual easement terms. The average remaining term of our easements and lease assignments is approximately 77 years (assuming perpetual easements, which comprise approximately 32% of our total easements, have a term of 99 years). When we acquire an easement or lease assignment in connection with a property subject to a mortgage, we generally also enter into a non‑disturbance agreement with the mortgage lender in order to protect us against potential foreclosure on the property owner at the infrastructure location, which foreclosure could, absent a non‑disturbance agreement, extinguish our easement or lease assignment. In some instances where we obtain non‑disturbance agreements, we still remain subordinated to some indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 86% of our tenant sites were either subject to non‑disturbance agreements or had been otherwise recorded in local real estate records in senior positions to any mortgages.
 Our easements and lease assignments strengthen and protect our real property interests in any given infrastructure location by allowing us to control the use of the tenant site after the expiration of the primary lease term (plus extension options) and to prevent a property owner from interfering with the operations of our tenants.
 Additionally, we believe that our easements and lease assignments have been and will continue to be acquired and structured in a manner that mitigates additional risks in many ways, including the following:
  
• | We record our easements and lease assignments in local real property records, giving constructive notice of our real property interest to all successor property owners and other parties of interest (such as future lenders).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We perform a title search prior to the acquisition of the easement or lease assignment and obtain title insurance on the easement or lease assignment except where doing so would not be economic or otherwise feasible, and all material exceptions to title are typically addressed prior to purchase.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our possessory use rights to the underlying property mitigate our liability exposure, and we are typically indemnified by the property owners or our tenants for environmental liability, if any, relating to the property. In addition, general liability insurance is typically provided by our tenants.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Our easements and lease assignments, together with our non‑disturbance agreements, generally protect our real property interest in case of a foreclosure against the property owner.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The property owner is generally contractually responsible for their property‑level operating expenses, including maintenance capital expenditures, taxes and insurance.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Finally, in the event that one of our tenant leases expires without renewal or is terminated, all of our easements and substantially all of our lease assignments allow us to enter into a new lease of the same space for the same use. For some of our easement or lease assignments, if we do not enter into a new lease during the tenant replacement period (typically three to five years), in the case of an easement, the easement terminates and control of the space reverts back to the property owner, or in the case of a lease assignment, we forfeit our right to re‑lease the space.
 In limited circumstances, we have granted a landowner the right to re‑acquire our real property interest at a purchase price which we believe makes us economically whole for the loss of an asset. To date, no landowner has exercised this right.
 Fee Simple Properties
 Our portfolio of real property interests includes 54 properties owned in fee simple. These properties have associated tenant leases in the wireless communication, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation industries. Generally, these property leases are subject to triple net or effectively triple net lease arrangements, meaning that our tenants are contractually responsible for property‑level operating expenses, including maintenance capital expenditures, taxes and insurance. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we received $7.9 million in rental revenue related to these properties, representing 15% of rental revenue.

(1) | Remaining term of real property interest is based on the assumption that the site is not vacant for a period longer than our tenant replacement period. This assumption is not used in calculating the remaining tenant lease terms and is inapplicable to the remaining term of real property interest of our fee simple properties.

(2) | “Leased Tenant Sites” means the number of individual sites that are leased. For example, if we have an easement on a single rooftop, on which three different tenants lease space from us, this would be counted as three “tenant sites,” and all three tenant sites would be at a single infrastructure location with the same address.

Other Assets
 While we generate substantially all of our revenue from our ownership and leasing of real property interests, we also generate a small amount of revenue from other assets including financing arrangements and management agreements whereby we purchased the right to receive a portion of a rental payment under a contract but are not a party to the lease and do not have a real property interest. Additionally, certain lease arrangements of real property interests meet the definition of a financial asset and are included in investments in receivables in our financial statements. Our other assets also include arrangements with T‑Mobile whereby we purchased the right to retain a portion of a lease payment prior to passing the remainder to the property owner. These cash flow financing arrangements are accounted for as receivables in our financial statements. 
Tenant Leases
 The majority of our tenant leases were acquired from property owners, who assigned to us all of the property owner’s rights, title and interest in and pursuant to (but generally excluding obligations under) a pre‑existing lease between the property owner and a third‑party tenant, such as a wireless carrier, cellular tower operator, billboard owner or renewable power producer. Generally, we do not assume all of the landlord’s obligations under the tenant lease, such as the obligation to provide quiet enjoyment of the property or to pay property taxes. These leases previously provided the property owner with a stream of rental payments, typically paid monthly or annually, and were assigned to us in exchange for an up‑front lump sum payment.
 Generally, our leased tenant sites are subject to triple net or effectively triple net lease arrangements, meaning that our tenants or the underlying property owners are contractually responsible for property‑level operating expenses, including maintenance capital expenditures, taxes and insurance. For this reason, we expect to have minimal ongoing expenses relating to our assets. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our property operating and maintenance expenses and maintenance capital expenditures were less than 1% of revenue.
 We believe our triple net and effectively triple net lease arrangements support a stable, consistent and predictable cash flow profile due to the following characteristics:
  
• | no equipment maintenance costs or obligations (tenant is responsible for all maintenance and Landmark’s role is limited to billing, collections and managing the ground lease);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | no property‑level maintenance capital expenditures; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | no property tax or insurance obligations (tenant or property owner is responsible for these costs).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our tenant leases are typically structured with five‑year, ten‑year or twenty-year initial terms and four additional, successive five‑year renewal terms. The average remaining lease term of our tenant leases is 25 years including renewal terms, and the average remaining lease term of our tenant leases is five years excluding renewal terms. Our tenant leases produce an average of approximately $2,000 per month in GAAP rental payments, but can range from as low as $30 per month to as much as $0.4 million per month. In addition, most of our tenant leases include built‑in rent escalators, which are typically structured as fixed amount increases, fixed percentage increases, or CPI‑based increases and increase rent annually or on the renewal of the lease term. Furthermore, 279 of our tenant leases, primarily in the outdoor advertising industry, contain revenue sharing provisions. As of December 31, 2017, over 93% of our tenant leases contained contractual rent escalators, 86% of which were fixed‑rate (with an average annual escalation rate of approximately 2.5%) and 7% of which were tied to CPI.
 Though our tenant leases are typically structured as long‑term leases with fixed rents and rent escalators, our wireless communication and outdoor advertising tenants generally may cancel their leases upon 30 to 180 days’ notice. However, occupancy rates under our tenant leases have historically been very high. As of December 31, 2017, we had 2,157 tenant sites leased and 82 tenant sites available for lease. We believe the infrastructure improvements and operations of the tenant assets located on our real property interests are essential to the ongoing operations and profitability of our tenants. We believe that by focusing on high‑quality real property interests we increase the likelihood that our tenants will renew their leases upon expiration. We believe that the importance of these assets, combined with the challenges and costs of relocating these infrastructure improvements, make it likely that we will continue to enjoy high tenant retention and occupancy rates. We believe the location of our available sites, the importance of these infrastructure assets, wireless network densification and difficulties in site acquisition provide additional collocation and releasing opportunities.
 
We monitor tenant credit quality on an ongoing basis by reviewing, where available, the publicly filed financial reports, press releases and other publicly available industry information regarding the parent entities of our tenants. In addition, we monitor payment history data for all of our tenants. We are otherwise generally not entitled to financial results or other credit‑related data from our tenants.

Our Tenants
 Our tenants operate in the wireless communication, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation industries. They are generally large, publicly traded companies (or their affiliates) with a national footprint. Approximately 85% of our rental revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was derived from our Tier 1 tenants. In the course of evaluating acquisition opportunities, we assess the desirability of an infrastructure location to our tenants and factors impacting demand of their customers.

Wireless Communication
 Our wireless communication tenants consist primarily of wireless carriers (and their affiliates), such as AT&T Mobility, Sprint, T‑Mobile and Verizon, and tower companies (and their affiliates) such as American Tower, Crown Castle and SBA Communications. These tenants generally lease from us space underlying their cellular towers, antennas, radios and other electronic communications equipment.
 We have strong renewal rates among our wireless communication tenants. We believe that this trend will continue because the decommissioning and repositioning of a current site in an existing carrier’s network is expensive and often requires the reconfiguration of several other sites within the carrier’s network, which may impact the carrier’s network quality and coverage. In addition, zoning restrictions may significantly delay, hinder or prevent entirely the construction of new sites. Construction, decommissioning and relocation of a current site may also require the carrier to obtain additional governmental permits, further increasing the cost of non‑renewal of a lease with us. In addition, as thousands of new tenant sites are constructed each year, many of these sites will be co‑located on towers and other structures located on our real property interests. We believe each of these attributes helps us achieve stable, consistent and predictable cash flow, which will lead to consistent distributions for our unitholders.
 Rental rates associated with wireless communication assets are tied to various factors, including:
  
• | infrastructure location;
--+-------------------------


• | amount, type and function of the tenant’s equipment on the infrastructure location;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ground space necessary for the tenant’s base station and other infrastructure required for the transmission and reception of signal;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | remaining capacity at the infrastructure location;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | shared back‑up power availability;
--+-----------------------------------


• | type of structure (e.g., stealth tower, rooftop, water tower); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | location of the customer’s antennas on the infrastructure location.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

Outdoor Advertising
 Our outdoor advertising tenants include companies (and their affiliates) that own and manage billboards, such as Clear Channel Outdoor, Lamar Advertising and Outfront Media. These tenants generally lease space from us underlying billboards, typically along highly trafficked freeways and intersections.
 We have strong renewal rates among our outdoor advertising tenants. We believe that this trend will continue because billboards are the primary revenue generating assets of our outdoor advertising tenants. The outdoor advertising market is characterized by strict local regulations and zoning laws, which have made it extremely difficult to erect new billboards in many markets. Additionally, many existing sites are “non‑conforming” with regard to current zoning standards but have been “grandfathered” in (and therefore not required to be removed) as they have been in place for long periods of time prior to the change in zoning standards. As such, there is typically a very high rate of lease renewal among our outdoor advertising tenants, and we believe that these renewals will continue to provide stable, growing revenue.
 Rental rates associated with outdoor advertising assets are tied to various factors, including:
  
• | infrastructure location;
--+-------------------------


• | illumination for night‑time visibility;
--+----------------------------------------


• | display and face size;
--+-----------------------


• | roadside position with respect to traffic flow;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | angle to the road for maximum visibility;
--+------------------------------------------


• | street type (e.g., highway, interstate, cross‑section);
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | traffic count;
--+---------------


• | viewer traffic metrics;
--+------------------------


• | type of display (e.g., static face, digital billboard, tri‑vision); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | height above ground level.

Renewable Power Generation
 Our renewable power generation tenants currently lease space from us underlying wind turbines or solar arrays. Our renewable power generation tenants’ counterparties consist primarily of subsidiaries or affiliates of credit rated utilities or high quality offtakers, such as Southern California Edison, Duke Energy and Pacific Gas and Electric. We expect renewable power generation to be an area of growth for our portfolio.
 We believe we will have strong renewal rates among our renewable power generation tenants. The renewable power generation industry is characterized by long development periods and projects of significant scale, typically requiring large capital commitments and several years of due diligence by the project operator to ensure suitability of the project location prior to commencement of project construction. In the case of wind turbines, a three‑year wind study is typically completed by the developer to study the wind patterns at the proposed project location. Similarly, prior to the construction of a commercial solar project, the developer will typically complete a review of historical weather patterns to evaluate the amount of uninterrupted access to sunlight at the project location. Developers must also consider accessibility to transmission infrastructure and power connects when selecting a project site, significantly restricting the ability to relocate a renewable power project.
 We intend to target renewable power projects that have been developed within the last five years, have the most current and efficient equipment with the longest useful life and the highest energy output. When seeking real property interests in this industry, we will seek assets that have a power purchase agreement in place between the owner of the project and a utility or other high credit quality offtaker. The power purchase agreement defines the terms between the counterparties and sets the sales price of the power generated for an extended period of time, typically twenty years. We believe these attributes lead to a very high rate of lease renewal and will help us achieve stable cash flow from the renewable power generation industry.

Our Relationship with Landmark
 One of our principal strengths and greatest competitive advantages is our relationship with Landmark. Landmark is one of the largest and most active acquirers of real property interests underlying infrastructure assets in the wireless communication, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation industries. Landmark, headquartered in Los Angeles, California, has approximately 160 employees and has offices and acquisition and development team members who work across the United States and Australia.
 Landmark has stated that it intends to continue to acquire additional real property interests in the wireless communication, outdoor advertising, renewable power generation and other fragmented industries, and that it intends to facilitate our growth through the sale of additional assets to us. As part of the IPO and formation transactions, in addition to the contribution of assets to us, Landmark purchased 2,066,995 subordinated units at the initial public offering price of our common units. As of December 31, 2017, including the subordinated units, Landmark and affiliates owns our general partner, all of the incentive distribution rights and a 14% limited partner interest in us. The requirements under our partnership agreement for the conversion of all the subordinated units into common units will be satisfied upon the payment of our quarterly cash distribution on February 14, 2018. Therefore, effective February 15, 2018, the subordinated units owned by Landmark will be converted on a one-for-one basis into common units. The conversion of subordinated units does not impact the amount of cash distributions, total number of outstanding units or Landmark’s limited partnership interest in us. Given its substantial cash investment and significant ownership in us, we believe Landmark will promote and support the successful execution of our business strategies. 
 While we believe Landmark is incentivized to support us, there are no restrictions on the ability of Landmark or its affiliates, including the Remaining Landmark Funds and new private funds that Landmark may form, to compete with us, including for the acquisition of future real property interests. We entered into an omnibus agreement with Landmark and the Remaining Landmark Funds pursuant to which the Remaining Landmark Funds granted us a right of first offer on real property interests that they currently own or acquire in the future before selling or transferring those assets to any third party. The assets subject to the right of first offer are comprised of approximately 700 tenant sites that the Remaining Landmark Funds own as of December 31, 2017 and additional real property interests they may acquire in the future in our target industries. Neither Landmark nor any of the Remaining Landmark Funds are obligated to offer to sell us any additional assets, except pursuant to our right of first offer, which the Remaining Landmark Funds are obligated to offer to sell to us, but only if and when those funds otherwise decide, in their sole discretion, to dispose of such assets. Landmark or the Remaining Funds may need to obtain third‑party consents in order to transfer certain of the assets subject to the right of first offer. In addition, we are under no obligation to buy any additional assets from Landmark or the Remaining Landmark Funds. The consideration to be paid by us for those assets, as well as the consummation and timing of any acquisition by us of those assets, would depend upon, among other things, the timing of Landmark’s decision to sell those assets and our ability to successfully negotiate a price and other purchase terms for those assets. Please read “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – If we are unable to make accretive acquisitions of real property interests, our growth could be limited” and “Conflicts of Interest.”
 Drop-down Acquisitions
 During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership completed four, five and eight drop-down acquisitions of 155, 539 and 761 tenant sites and related real property interests, respectively, and two, 14 and one investment in receivables, respectively, from the Sponsor and affiliates in exchange for total consideration of $118.3 million, $205.7 million and $268.2 million, respectively (the “Drop-down Acquisitions” or “Drop-down Assets”). The 2016 and 2015 Drop-down Acquisitions were deemed to be transactions between entities under common control, which, prior to the adoption of ASU No. 2017-01, on April 1, 2017, as described below, required the assets and liabilities transferred be reflected at the historical cost of the parent of the entities, with prior periods retroactively adjusted to furnish comparative information. All 2017 Drop-down acquisitions that occurred after the adoption of ASU No. 2017-01 are a transfer of net assets accounted for prospectively in the period. See Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

Landmark’s Acquisition Platform
 Landmark’s senior management team has an average of over 20 years of experience with real property and infrastructure acquisitions and development in industries with fragmented real property ownership. Landmark’s senior management team has an established track record and deep domain expertise across all aspects of the business including sourcing, underwriting, acquisition, financing and asset management.
 The real property interests Landmark seeks to acquire generally range in value from $50,000 to $500,000. As a result, Landmark must assemble large pools of assets to achieve portfolio critical mass and diversification. To accomplish this, specialized teams within Landmark use custom information technology systems and processes developed over the past decade to manage workflow while providing management with the ability to monitor and direct activity in real‑time. Through these proprietary processes, Landmark efficiently evaluates assets to ensure they meet Landmark’s stringent underwriting criteria. Landmark believes that the small individual asset size, together with the expertise and discipline required to close high acquisition volumes, creates a significant barrier to entry for prospective competitors. We expect to benefit greatly from Landmark’s acquisition platform, which we believe will continue to facilitate the acquisition of attractive assets for our business.
 Asset Life Cycle through the Acquisition Platform
 The Landmark process has been specifically designed to be as seamless and efficient for the owner as possible (and, in doing so, more efficient for Landmark as well). Landmark has customized its processes and documentation for its specific business, emphasizing customer interaction and delivering a high‑quality transaction experience. In addition, documentation is requested from the property owner in a concise, straightforward manner and expectations and timing are discussed with the owner, making the transaction process transparent to the property owner. In this way, the property owner is engaged, there are limited surprises and the closing process is more of a joint exercise between Landmark and the property owner, resulting in a better customer experience.
 Landmark’s high volume, small balance real property acquisition and asset management platform has four primary phases which include: (1) Lead Generation; (2) Origination; (3) Underwriting and Closing; and (4) Asset Management.
 Lead Generation
 Landmark developed a proprietary lead‑generation system that expedites the identification of small balance real property interests in fragmented real property ownership industries. This system, used by its employees to identify asset prospects, facilitates the aggregation of directly‑sourced field data. Once an infrastructure location prospect has been identified, Landmark’s team leverages a variety of proven data and technology resources and strategies to obtain preliminary contact information for the property owner, referred to as a “lead”. Leads are qualified by a dedicated team that validates data directly with the owner of the infrastructure location. Once the property owner’s address and contact information is confirmed, an account is created and an appointment is arranged.
Origination
 The origination process begins with a meeting between a Landmark acquisition professional and the property owner. Landmark’s acquisition professionals engage in meetings with property owners to establish a relationship, discuss the owner’s needs and objectives, and educate the owner on the value of Landmark’s proposed transaction. During these meetings, acquisition professionals evaluate the appropriateness of Landmark’s proposed transaction for the property owner and their interest level in selling their real property interest. Once Landmark obtains a copy of the lease from the property owner, relevant data is input into Landmark’s proprietary asset evaluation system to generate an acquisition agreement. The acquisition agreement terms are negotiated with the property owner and, upon acceptance of the agreement, Landmark uploads the executed agreement and necessary documentation to its proprietary technology platform for further diligence by the dedicated underwriting and closing team.
 17


Underwriting and Closing
 After Landmark’s proposal has been accepted by the property owner and an acquisition agreement has been executed, the transaction is moved to Landmark’s dedicated underwriting and closing team. The account enters a comprehensive due diligence process to ensure consistent quality across Landmark’s portfolio of asset acquisitions. Curative measures are taken to clear title on the real property interest (for example, an outstanding creditor’s lien) simultaneous with the underwriting and due diligence process. Given its considerable experience, depth of resources, and proven processes, Landmark is able to perform a comprehensive and efficient underwriting of the risk and value assessment on its high‑volume acquisition pipeline. We believe this is one of Landmark’s greatest strengths and competitive advantages and is driven by (i) Landmark’s extensive database of comparable transactions and leases, and (ii) its thorough understanding of applicable underwriting factors (such as which intersections or highways tend to have the most traffic, applicable zoning regulations and the availability of nearby wireless or advertising sites). In the underwriting stage, Landmark reviews various transaction materials and documents for compliance with Landmark’s underwriting criteria, including, but not limited to, the following:

• | current industry macro and micro risks;
--+----------------------------------------


• | tenant counterparty risk;
--+--------------------------


• | lease economics;
--+-----------------


• | lease terms;
--+-------------


• | “seasoning,” or whether the property has a proven track record of tenant lease payments, and the details of that track record;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | evaluation of real estate and infrastructure based in part on site visits and surveys;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | site demographics;
--+-------------------


• | competitive landscape analysis; and
--+------------------------------------


• | rent analysis based on Landmark’s proprietary database of comparative rents in the target area.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Once a transaction is deemed to meet Landmark’s due diligence and underwriting standards, it proceeds to Landmark’s investment committee for approval of the acquisition. Pending approval, legal closing documents are prepared, executed and delivered. Due to its streamlined proprietary acquisition process, Landmark has the ability to quickly close acquisitions. We expect to continue to benefit from Landmark’s high acquisition volumes and more efficient, scalable processes.
 Asset Management
 After funding, tenants are notified of the acquisition and notarized payment re‑direction letters are sent advising the tenant to redirect rental payments to Landmark. All post‑closing items are revisited, the lease data is re‑verified and moved to Landmark’s asset management, where compliance is monitored on an ongoing basis. The tenant management phase includes collections, tenant payment conversion, tenant relations, and tenant contact management. The asset management phase also includes the negotiation of lease renewals, modifications, cancellations, reductions, document and consent requests, landlord and tenant complaints and new leasing of available tenant sites.
Direct Third-Party Acquisitions
 The Partnership completed direct third-party acquisitions of real property interests in the wireless communication, outdoor advertising and renewable power industries in domestic and international locations. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Partnership acquired 63 tenant sites and one investment in receivables and 40 tenant sites from third parties for total consideration of $41.0 million and $85.7 million, respectively. See Note 3, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information.
 In December 2016, the Partnership formed a joint venture to acquire real property interests that are leased to companies in the outdoor advertising industry located in Europe. The Partnership consolidates the joint venture. Our venture partner provides acquisition opportunities and asset management services to the consolidated joint venture. As of December 31, 2017, the consolidated joint venture had ten tenant sites and one investment in receivables with total assets of $31.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017 the consolidated joint venture generated rental revenue of $0.8 million. 
 18


Infrastructure Development
 During 2017, the Partnership started developing an ecosystem of technologies that provides smart enabled infrastructure (“Flex Grid”) including the Zero Site microgrid solution and digital outdoor advertising kiosks across North America. The Zero Site is a self-contained, neutral-host smart pole designed for wireless carrier and other wireless operator collocation. The Zero Site is designed for macro, mini macro and small cell deployments and will support Internet of Things (IoT), carrier densification needs, private LTE networks and other wireless solutions. The Flex Grid solution focuses on providing a turnkey site for tenants. Our infrastructure development focuses on deployment on commercial properties, municipality properties and transportation facilities in densified urban locations located in the United States and Canada. As of December 31, 2017, the Partnership’s $7.6 million construction in progress balance related to the Flex Grid solution.
Regulation
 Environmental Matters
 Laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment are applicable to our business and operations, and also to the businesses and operations of our lessees, property owners and other surface owners or operators. Federal, state and local government agencies issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and that may result in injunctive obligations for non‑compliance. These laws and regulations often require permits before operations commence, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment, require remediation of released substances, and limit or prohibit construction or operations on certain lands (e.g. wetlands). We do not conduct any operations on our properties, but we or our tenants may maintain small quantities of materials that, if released, would be subject to certain environmental laws. Similarly, our property owners, lessees and other surface interest owners may have liability or responsibility under these laws which could have an indirect impact on our business. These laws include but are not limited to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder (which impose requirements on the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non‑hazardous wastes) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), and analogous state laws which generally impose liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment, including the current and former owners or operators of a site. It is not uncommon for neighboring property owners and other third‑parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. Therefore, governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us, our lessees, property owners and other surface interest owners responsible under CERCLA and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to cleanup sites at which hazardous substances have been released. Our agreements with our lessees, property owners and other surface owners generally include environmental representations, warranties, and indemnities to minimize the extent to which we may be financially responsible for liabilities arising under these laws.
Seasonality
 We receive fixed rental payments under our tenant leases that are typically paid on a monthly basis, and we expect to experience some seasonal effect on our cash flow due to rents paid annually. Additionally, we have revenue sharing provisions under a portion of our tenant leases, which may result in some seasonal effect on our cash flow.
Competition
 We face competition in the acquisition, development and leasing of our infrastructure assets in each of our target industries. Some of the competitors are larger than us and include public entities with greater access to capital and scale of operations than us. In addition, Landmark and its affiliates will compete with us for acquisitions, development and the leasing of real property interests. Please read “Risk Factors – Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us – Landmark and the Remaining Landmark Funds may compete with us, and Landmark, as owner of our general partner, will decide when, if and how we complete acquisitions.”
 In the acquisition of real property interests underlying our tenants’ infrastructure, our principal competitors include our tenants and private independent acquirers focused on individual industries. In the wireless communication industry, the principal competitors include tower companies such as American Tower, Crown Castle International and SBA Communications and private independent acquirers such as Melody Wireless Infrastructure. In the outdoor advertising industry, the outdoor advertising tenants (such as Lamar) and smaller regional private investors would be our principal competitor. In the renewable power generation industry, the principal competitor is Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital, Inc. We believe the most significant factors affecting the competitive environment in the acquisition of real property interest underlying our tenant’s infrastructure include the relationship with the property owner, price offered, structure and terms of the acquisition, time to closing and surety of closing.
 19


In the leasing of real property interests in the wireless communication industry, our principal competitors include our tenants, private property owners, REITs (including the tower companies) and the government. In the wireless communication industry, our principal competitors include wireless carriers that own their own tower networks, tower companies such as American Tower Corporation, Crown Castle and SBA Communications, private independent owners of portfolios of real property interest such as Melody Wireless Infrastructure, real estate owners, REITs, utilities, municipalities and other companies that provide structures upon which wireless communication equipment may be installed. In the outdoor advertising industry, the principal competitors include private real estate owners, REITs and municipalities. In the renewable power generation industry, the principal competitors include private real estate owners, REITs and municipalities. We believe the most significant factors affecting the competitive environment in the leasing of real property interest underlying our tenant’s infrastructure include site location and capacity, quality of service, density within a geographic market and, to a lesser extent, price.
 Employees
 We are managed and operated by the board of directors and executive officers of Landmark Infrastructure Partners GP LLC, our general partner. Neither we nor our subsidiaries have any employees. Our general partner has the sole responsibility for providing the employees and other personnel necessary to conduct our operations. All of the employees that conduct our business are employed by affiliates of our general partner. As of December 31, 2017, our general partner and its affiliates have approximately 30 employees performing services for our operations. We believe that our general partner and its affiliates have a satisfactory relationship with those employees.
