The Company’s principal business strategy is to enhance stockholder value by generating and developing high-potential exploitation resources in these areas. The Company’s principal business is the acquisition of leasehold interests in petroleum and natural gas rights, either directly or indirectly, and the exploitation and development of properties subject to these leases. The Company has leased property in Colorado and is currently searching for additional opportunities in the natural gas and petroleum industry. Our initial goal has been to lease the oil and gas properties of acreage that has a high likelihood of becoming a producing property. We will require additional funding to drill and complete a producing natural gas and petroleum well.

Competition
 
Our natural gas and petroleum exploitation development and our future production activities will take place in a highly competitive and speculative business atmosphere. In seeking suitable natural gas and petroleum properties for acquisition, we compete with a number of other companies operating in our areas of interest, including large natural gas and petroleum companies and other independent operators. Many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do, which is exacerbated due to our current liquidity position. Also, many have been engaged in the exploration and production business for a much longer time than we have or not only explore for and produce, but also market natural gas and oil and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. Many of our competitors also have a substantially larger operating staff than we do. These competitors may be able to pay more for productive natural gas and oil properties and exploratory prospects and define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than us. In addition, these competitors may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low market prices. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment.
Governmental Regulation
 
If our natural gas and petroleum activities are successful, we will be subject are subject to stringent federal, regional, state, and local laws and regulations governing occupational safety and health, the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of permits before conducting drilling or other regulated activities, limit or prohibit operations on environmentally sensitive lands such as wetlands or wilderness areas, require capital expenditures to limit or prevent emissions or discharges, impose specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection, and place restrictions on the management of wastes. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctive relief. Any changes in environmental laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly well drilling, construction, completion or water management activities, or waste handling, disposal or cleanup requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. While we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not materially affect us, there is no assurance that this trend will continue in the future.
