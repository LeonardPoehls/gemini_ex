Item 1. Business
Overview
BioTelemetry, Inc. provides monitoring services and digital population health management for healthcare providers, medical device manufacturing and centralized core laboratory services for clinical research. Since we became focused on cardiac monitoring in 1999, we have developed a proprietary integrated patient management platform that incorporates a wireless data transmission network, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) cleared algorithms, medical devices and 24-hour monitoring service centers.
In July 2017, we acquired LifeWatch, a supplier of mobile cardiac monitoring solutions, headquartered in Zug, Switzerland with U.S. operations based in Rosemont, IL. We believe the integration of LifeWatch will create one of the most comprehensive connected healthcare platforms in the world, by continuing to develop innovative remote cardiac monitoring solutions and delivering those solutions to meet today’s healthcare challenges. See “Part II; Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; Recent Developments” and “Part II; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 3. Acquisitions” below for further discussions related to this transaction.
BioTelemetry operates under three reportable segments: (1) Healthcare, (2) Research and (3) Technology. The Healthcare segment, which generated 81% of our revenue in 2017, is focused on the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiac arrhythmias or heart rhythm disorders. We offer cardiologists and electrophysiologists, neurologists and primary care physicians a full spectrum of solutions which provides them with a single source of cardiac monitoring services. These services range from the differentiated mobile cardiac telemetry service (“MCT”), to event, traditional Holter, extended-wear Holter, Pacemaker and International Normalized Ratio (“INR”) monitoring. The Research segment, which generated 14% of our revenue in 2017, is engaged in central core laboratory services providing cardiac monitoring, imaging services, scientific consulting and data management services for drug and medical device trials. The Technology segment, which generated 5% of our revenue in 2017, focuses on the development, manufacturing, testing and marketing of cardiovascular and blood glucose monitoring devices to medical companies, clinics and hospitals. See “Part II; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 17. Segment Information” below for further discussions related to segments.
As of July 31, 2013, we reorganized to create a holding company structure. CardioNet, Inc., which was previously the public company, became a wholly owned subsidiary of a newly formed entity, BioTelemetry, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and all the outstanding shares of CardioNet, Inc. were exchanged, on a one-for-one basis, for shares of BioTelemetry, Inc. Our new holding company began trading on August 1, 2013 on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under our same symbol “BEAT.”

Business Strategy
Our goals are to solidify our position as the leading provider of outpatient cardiac monitoring services, expand our presence in the research market and leverage our monitoring platform in new markets. The key elements of the business strategy by which we intend to achieve these goals include:

• | Increase Demand for Our Comprehensive Cardiac Monitoring Solutions. We believe that we can increase demand for our comprehensive portfolio of outpatient cardiac monitoring solutions by educating cardiologists, electrophysiologists and neurologists on the benefits of using mobile cardiac telemetry to meet their arrhythmia monitoring needs, stressing the increased diagnostic yield and their ability to use the clinically significant data to make timely interventions and guide more effective treatments. 


• | Expand Our Presence in the Research Market. In December 2010, we entered the core lab services business through our acquisition of Agility Centralized Research. We later were able to expand our presence in clinical research with our acquisition of Cardiocore Lab, LLC (“Cardiocore”) in August 2012 and our purchase of the assets of RadCore Lab, LLC (“RadCore”) in June 2014. In 2016, we further expanded our core lab capabilities with the acquisition of VirtualScopics, Inc. (“VirtualScopics”), a leading provider of clinical trial imaging solutions. We continue to focus our efforts on increasing our presence in the research market and on becoming a preferred global provider as it provides us with the ability to diversify our service offerings. 


• | Leverage Our Core Competencies to New Market Opportunities. We believe our core competencies can be leveraged for applications in multiple markets. While our initial focus has been on arrhythmia diagnosis and monitoring, we intend to expand into new market areas that require outpatient or ambulatory monitoring and management. In line with this goal, we acquired Telcare, the first company to receive FDA clearance for a cellular-enabled Blood Glucose Monitoring (“BGM”) system, increasing our presence in the large and rapidly growing digital population health management market. 

Healthcare
The Healthcare segment, or BioTel Heart, operating under the legal entities of CardioNet, LLC (“CardioNet”), LifeWatch and Heartcare Corporation of America, Inc. (“Heartcare”), is focused on the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiac arrhythmias, or heart rhythm disorders. We provide cardiologists, electrophysiologists, neurologists and primary care physicians who prefer to use a single source of cardiac monitoring services with a full spectrum of solutions, ranging from our differentiated MCT services to event to extended wear and Holter monitoring and traditional Holter monitoring. We also provide Pacemaker and INR monitoring.
Our MCT services incorporate a lightweight patient-worn sensor attached to electrodes that capture two-channel electrocardiogram (“ECG”) data, measuring electrical activity of the heart, on a compact wireless handheld monitor. The monitor analyzes incoming heartbeat-by-heartbeat information from the sensor on a real-time basis by applying proprietary algorithms designed to detect arrhythmias. The monitor can detect an arrhythmic event even in the absence of symptoms noticed by the patient. When the monitor detects an arrhythmic event, it automatically transmits the ECG to our monitoring centers. At our monitoring centers, which operate 24/7, experienced certified cardiac monitoring specialists analyze the sent data, respond to urgent events and report results in the manner prescribed by the physician. The MCT devices employ two-way wireless communications, enabling continuous transmission of patient data to the 
5

monitoring centers and permitting physicians to remotely adjust monitoring parameters and request previous ECG data from the memory stored in the monitor. The MCT devices have the capability of storing 30 days of continuous ECG data, in contrast to a maximum of 10 minutes for a typical event monitor and a maximum of 24 hours for a typical Holter monitor. In 2016, we obtained FDA approval of our next generation MCT in a patch form factor. The MCT patch is a four-lead, two-channel system which provides the same best in class technology as the current MCT, in a more convenient form factor. The MCT patch was commercially launched in limited accounts during 2017, with a full launch expected in the first quarter of 2018.
Our event monitoring services provide physicians with the flexibility to prescribe wireless event monitors, digital loop event monitors, memory loop event monitors and non-loop event monitors. Event data is transmitted, either through automatic transmission of event data with wireless event monitors or through telephonic transmission of stored event data with our traditional event monitors, to one of our monitoring centers where our trained cardiac technicians analyze the data.
Traditional Holter and extended-wear Holter monitors store an image of the electrical impulses of every heartbeat or irregularity in digital format on a compact memory card. The memory card is mailed or the data is sent electronically through a secure web transfer to one of our Holter labs, where our trained cardiac technicians analyze the data. Our next generation Holter monitor, the CardioKey™ and ePatch™ are small, lightweight cardiac monitors, which can continuously store up to 7-14 days of cardiac images.
We market our services throughout the United States and receive reimbursement for the monitoring provided to patients from Medicare and other third-party commercial payors.
Research
The Research segment, or BioTel Research, operating under the legal entities of Cardiocore and VirtualScopics, is engaged in central core laboratory services that provide cardiac monitoring, imaging services, scientific consulting and data management services for drug, medical treatment and device trials. We entered the research field through the acquisition of Agility Centralized Research in December 2010, and later expanded our presence with the asset acquisition of Cardiocore in August 2012 and RadCore in June 2014. The centralized services include ECG, Holter monitoring, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, echocardiography, multigated acquisition scan (“MUGA”), a full range of imaging services, protocol development, expert reporting and statistical analysis. Our imaging services offerings were bolstered by our 2016 acquisition of VirtualScopics, a leading provider of clinical trial imaging solutions and services in the cardiovascular, oncology, musculoskeletal and neurologic therapeutic areas. Through these acquisitions, we gained global experience in central core laboratory services, which includes experience in Phase I-IV and Thorough QT Trials. We also provide a full range of support services that include project coordination, setup and management, equipment rental, data transfer, processing, analysis and 24/7 customer support and site training. Our data management systems enable complete customization for sponsors’ preferred data specifications, and our web service, CardioPortal™, provides access to rich data from any web browser, without client-side plug-ins. Our primary customers are pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations. We operate locations domestically, which support both domestic and international operations.

Technology
The Technology segment, operating under the legal entities of Braemar Manufacturing, LLC (“Braemar”), Telcare (“Telcare”) and to a lesser extent, LifeWatch, focuses on the manufacturing, engineering and development of non-invasive cardiac monitors for leading healthcare companies worldwide. We have been able to build successful customer relationships by providing reliable, quality products and engineering services. We offer contract manufacturing services, developing and producing devices to the specific requirements set by customers. 
Braemar manufactures various devices including, but not limited to, cardiac event monitors, digital Holter monitors and MCT monitors utilized by our Healthcare segment. Our facilities located in San Diego, CA and Eagan, MN are responsible for research and product development under FDA guidelines. Manufacturing of devices is performed in our Eagan, MN facility. We believe that our manufacturing facilities will be sufficient to meet our manufacturing needs for the foreseeable future.
In addition, in December 2016, we acquired Telcare, the first company to receive FDA clearance for a cellular-enabled BGM system. This wireless BGM system transmits real-time results to a cloud-based analytical engine, which synthesizes the data, monitors trends and provides caregivers with critical information about the patients’ health status and the potential need to intervene. 
We believe our manufacturing operations are in compliance with regulations mandated by the applicable governing bodies. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and we successfully completed routine inspections by the FDA in October 2017 (Eagan, MN), May 2016 (Rosemont, IL) and February 2016 (Concord, MA), with no significant findings noted or warnings issued. Our Eagan, MN, San Diego, CA and Concord, MA facilities are ISO 13485 certified and registered with the FDA. ISO 13485 is a quality system standard used by medical companies providing design, development, manufacturing, installation and servicing, and is the basis for acquiring European Conformity Marking (“CE Marking”) for medical device product distribution in the European Union. Many of our devices also carry a CE Marking.
There are a number of critical components and sub-assemblies in the devices. The vendors for these materials are qualified through stringent evaluation and testing of their performance. We implement a strict no-change policy with our contract manufacturers to ensure that no components are changed without our approval.
Research and Development
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we spent $11.1 million, $8.4 million and $7.1 million, respectively, on research and development activities focused on developing new products and enhancements to our existing products. We intend to continue to develop proof of superiority of our technology through clinical data. The three primary sources of clinical data that we have used to date to illustrate the clinical value of MCT include: (i) a randomized 300-patient clinical study; (ii) our cumulative actual monitoring experience from our databases; and (iii) numerous other published studies.
We sponsored and completed a 17-center, 300-patient randomized clinical trial in March 2007. We believe this study, at that time, represented the largest randomized study comparing two non-invasive arrhythmia monitoring methods. The study was designed to evaluate patients who were suspected to have an arrhythmic cause underlying their symptoms but who were a diagnostic challenge given that they had already had a non-diagnostic 24-hour Holter monitoring session or four hours of telemetry monitoring within 45 days prior to enrollment. Patients were randomized to either MCT or to a loop event monitor 
7

for up to 30 days. Of the 300 patients who were randomized, 266 patients who completed a minimum of 25 days of monitoring were analyzed (134 patients using MCT and 132 patients using loop event monitors).
The study specifically compared the success of MCT against loop event monitors in detecting patients with clinically significant arrhythmias and demonstrated the superiority of MCT for confirming the diagnosis of these types of arrhythmias. The study also demonstrated the advantage of using MCT compared to the loop event monitor in the detection of asymptomatic atrial fibrillation or flutter. Diagnosis and treatment of atrial fibrillation is important because it can lead to many other medical problems, including stroke. The study concluded that MCT provided a significantly higher diagnostic yield, in detecting an arrhythmic event in patients with symptoms of cardiac arrhythmia, compared to traditional loop event monitoring, including such monitoring designed to automatically detect certain arrhythmias.
In addition to the aforementioned 300-patient randomized clinical trial, MCT has been cited and referenced in over 40 publications and abstracts, which lends support to its clinical efficacy.
Sales and Marketing
We market our cardiac monitoring solutions through a direct sales force primarily to cardiologists, electrophysiologists and neurologists who are the physician specialists who most commonly diagnose and manage patients with arrhythmias. We sponsor peer-to-peer educational events and participate in targeted public relations opportunities. We are a leading member of the Remote Cardiac Service Provider Group. We market our research services to pharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, contract research organizations and academic research organizations. Cardiocore is a founding member and the first cardiac core lab to join the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium (“CSRC”). Through the CSRC, we are able to network with representatives of major pharmaceutical companies, as well as discuss key cardiac safety issues during the drug development process. Through the 2016 acquisition of VirtualScopics, we have broadened our research service offerings, allowing us to more favorably compete for research studies requiring a wider range of research services. We market our manufactured products to physicians, hospitals and other cardiac monitoring providers.
We attend trade shows and medical conferences to promote our various product and service offerings. The trade shows and conferences we attend are related to organizations such as: the Heart Rhythm Society, American College of Cardiology, Society of Thoracic Surgeons, European Society of Cardiology, American Heart Association and the American Telemedicine Association. We also attend the Medica, DIA and Partnerships in Clinical Trials trade shows as well as the annual Boston Atrial Fibrillation Conference.
Healthcare Reimbursement
In the Healthcare segment, services are billed to government and commercial payors using specific codes describing the services. Those codes are part of the Commercial Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) coding system which was established by the American Medical Association (“AMA”) to describe services provided by physicians and other suppliers. Physicians select the code that best describes the medical services being prescribed. Approximately 34% of our total revenue is subject to reimbursement from the Medicare program, a federal government health insurance program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), at rates that are set nationally and adjusted for certain regional indices.
In addition to receiving reimbursement from Medicare, we enter into contracts with commercial payors to receive reimbursement at specified rates for our technical services. Such contracts typically provide for an initial term of between one and three years and provide for automatic renewal thereafter. 
8

Either party can typically terminate these contracts by providing between 60 and 120 days’ prior notice to the other party at any time following the end of the initial term of the agreement. The contracts provide for an agreed upon reimbursement rate, which in some instances is tied to the rate of reimbursement we receive from Medicare. 
In addition to receiving reimbursement from government and commercial payors, we have direct arrangements with physicians who may purchase our monitoring services and then submit claims for these services directly to commercial and government payors. In some cases, patients pay for their service out-of-pocket.
Competition
Although we believe that we have a leading market share in the mobile cardiac monitoring industry, the market in which our Healthcare segment operates is fragmented and characterized by a large number of smaller regional service providers. Additionally, several larger healthcare companies offer certain cardiac monitoring solutions, primarily Holter monitors. We believe that the principal competitive factors that impact the success of our cardiac monitoring solutions include some or all of the following: 

• | quality of our algorithms used to detect symptoms;


• | quality of clinical data;


• | ease of use and reliability of cardiac monitoring solutions for patients and physicians;


• | technology performance, innovation, flexibility and range of application;


• | timeliness and clinical relevance of new product introductions;


• | quality and availability of customer support services;


• | size, experience, knowledge and training of sales and marketing staff;


• | reputation;


• | relationships with referring physicians, hospitals, managed care organizations and other third-party payors;


• | reporting capabilities;


• | spectrum of solutions, ranging from our differentiated MCT services to event and Holter monitoring, making us a single source for cardiac monitoring services; and


• | perceived value.

We believe that we compete favorably based on the factors described above. However, our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive, and the basis on which we compete may change over time. In addition, if companies with substantially greater resources than ours enter our market, we will face increased competition.
Our Research segment competes directly with other core labs as well as contract research organizations that offer core lab services. We believe that we compete favorably based on our comprehensive cardiac and imaging service offerings, the scale of our operation and our ability to support the entire life cycle of new drug development.
9

Our Technology segment competes directly with other original equipment manufacturers. We believe that we compete favorably based on our suite of quality products and innovative solutions, our superior customer service and our extensive industry experience.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, non-disclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by filing patent applications for new features and products we develop. In addition, we also seek to maintain certain intellectual property and proprietary know-how as trade secrets, and generally require our partners to execute non-disclosure agreements prior to any substantive discussions or disclosures of our technology or business plans. Our business and competitive positions are dependent in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our ability to avoid infringing the patents or proprietary rights of others.
We hold patents in the United States as well as many international jurisdictions on our products, processes and related technologies. In furtherance of our overall global intellectual property strategy, we also have patent applications currently on file in the United States and internationally. While we have several patents expiring between 2018 and 2032, including patents that relate, in part, to our key products, we do not believe such expirations will have a material impact on our ability to compete in the short term since our technology is typically covered by several patents, creating a system of protected technology.
Our trademarks, certain of which are material to our business, are registered or otherwise legally protected in the United States and in certain foreign countries and include, among others, the registered trademarks CardioNet®, BioTelemetry® and LifeWatch® and the unregistered trademarks Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry™, MCOT™, CardioPortal™, BioTel Heart™, BioTel Care™, BioTel Research™ and BioTel Technology™. We also have a significant amount of copyright-protected materials.
Government Regulation
The health care industry is highly regulated, with no guarantee that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change significantly and adversely in the future. We believe that health care legislation, rules, regulations and interpretations will change, and we expect to modify our agreements and operations in response to these changes.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The medical devices that we use to provide patient monitoring services are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The basic regulatory requirements that manufacturers of medical devices distributed in the United Sates must comply with are Premarket Notification 510(k), unless exempt, or Premarket Approval, establishment registration, medical device listing, quality system regulation, labeling requirements and medical device reporting.
The algorithms we use in the MCT service maintain FDA 510(k) clearance as a Class II device (“510(k) Clearance”). On October 28, 2003, the FDA issued a guidance document entitled: “Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Arrhythmia Detector and Alarm.” In addition to conforming to the general requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including the Premarket Notification requirements described above, all of our cardiac related 510(k) submissions address the specific issues covered in this special controls guidance document. The algorithms we use in the BGM service also maintain FDA 510(k) Clearance as a Class II device.
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include certain sanctions, such as fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall or seizure of our devices and intellectual property; operating restrictions; partial suspension or total shutdown of 
10

production; withdrawal of 510(k) Clearance of new components or algorithms; withdrawal of 510(k) Clearance already granted to one or more of our existing components or algorithms; and criminal prosecution.
CE Marking. Medical devices distributed within the European Economic Area require a CE Marking. ISO 13485 is a quality system standard used by medical companies providing design, development, manufacturing, installation and servicing, and is the basis for acquiring CE Marking for medical device product distribution in the European Union. Failure to maintain appropriate CE Marking could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our devices within the European Union.
Health Care Fraud and Abuse. In the United States, there are state and federal anti-kickback laws that generally prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients or other health care-related business. In addition, federal law (e.g., the “Stark” law) and some state laws prohibit the existence of certain financial relationships between referring physicians and health care providers and suppliers unless those relationships meet the requirements of specific exceptions to the law. Anti-kickback laws constrain our sales, marketing and promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements we may have with physicians, medical centers and others in a position to purchase, recommend or refer patients for our cardiac monitoring services or other products or services we may develop and commercialize. Due to the breadth of some of these laws, it is possible that some of our current or future practices might be challenged under one or more of these laws.
Furthermore, federal and state false claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. Violations may result in substantial civil penalties, including treble damages, and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, fines and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. The Federal False Claims Act also contains “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions that allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the government. Various states have enacted laws modeled after the Federal False Claims Act, including “qui tam” provisions, and some of these laws apply to claims filed with commercial insurers. Any violations of anti-kickback and false claims laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. On March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law, and on March 30, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 was signed into law. Together, the two measures, collectively known as the Affordable Care Act, make the most sweeping and fundamental changes to the United States health care system since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. The Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid eligibility, required most individuals have health insurance or pay a penalty, imposed new requirements for health plans and insurance policy standards, established health insurance exchanges, changed Medicare payment systems to encourage more cost-effective care and new expanded tools to address fraud and abuse and required manufacturers of medical devices and other products reimbursed by Medicare to report annually to the government certain payments to physicians and teaching hospitals.
As a result of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, manufacturers of certain medical devices are subject to an excise tax, applicable to sales of taxable medical devices beginning January 1, 2013. Several devices that are manufactured by our Technology segment are subject to these taxes. The tax equals 2.3% of the sale price of the applicable medical device. As a manufacturer, we are responsible for remitting these taxes to the federal government. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, enacted on December 18, 2015, included a moratorium on the medical devices tax commencing on January 1, 2016 and ending on 
11

December 31, 2017. Budget legislation signed in January 2018 extended that moratorium through December 31, 2019.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) was enacted by the United States Congress in 1996. Numerous state and federal laws govern the collection, dissemination, use and confidentiality of patient and other health information, including the administrative simplification and privacy provisions of HIPAA. Historically, state law has governed confidentiality issues, and HIPAA preserves these laws to the extent they are more protective of a patient’s privacy or provide the patient with greater access to his or her health information. As a result of the implementation of the HIPAA regulations, many states are considering revisions to their existing laws and regulations that may or may not be more stringent or burdensome than the federal HIPAA provisions. HIPAA applies directly to covered entities, which include health plans, health care clearinghouses and many health care providers. The HIPAA statute, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act in 2009, and its implementation rules are concerned primarily with the privacy of protected health information when it is used and/or disclosed; the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic health information; notifying federal regulators and impacted patients in the event of a breach of unsecured protected health information; and the content and format of certain identified electronic health care transactions. The laws governing health care information privacy and security impose civil and criminal penalties for their violation and can require substantial expenditures of financial and other resources for information technology system modifications and for ongoing operational compliance.
Medicare. Medicare is a federal program administered by CMS and its Medicare administrative contractors. The Medicare program provides qualified persons with health care benefits that cover the major costs of medical care within prescribed limits, subject to certain deductibles and co-payments. The Medicare program has established guidelines for local and national coverage determinations and reimbursement of certain equipment, supplies and services, which are subject to change. The methodology for determining coverage status and the basis and amount of Medicare reimbursement varies based upon, among other factors, the setting in which a Medicare beneficiary receives health care items and services.
The Medicare program is subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate adjustments, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy, Medicare administrative contractor determinations and government funding restrictions. All of these policies may materially increase or decrease the rate of program payments to health care facilities and other health care suppliers and practitioners, including those paid for our cardiac monitoring services. Any changes in federal legislation, regulations or other policies affecting Medicare coverage or reimbursement relative to our cardiac monitoring services could have an adverse effect on our performance.
Certain of our facilities are enrolled in Medicare as Independent Diagnostic Testing Facilities (“IDTFs”). An IDTF is defined by CMS as an entity independent of a hospital or physician’s office in which diagnostic tests are performed by licensed or certified non-physician personnel under appropriate physician supervision. Medicare has set very detailed performance standards that every IDTF must meet in order to obtain or maintain its billing privileges, including requirements to, among other things, operate in compliance with all applicable federal and state licensure and regulatory requirements for the health and safety of patients; maintain a physical facility on an appropriate site meeting specific criteria; have a comprehensive liability insurance policy of at least $0.3 million per location; disclose certain ownership information; have its testing equipment calibrated and maintained in accordance with specific standards; have technical staff on duty with the appropriate credentials to perform tests; and permit on-site inspections. 
12

These requirements are subject to change. We believe that our facilities are in compliance with the IDTF standards.
Environmental Regulation. We use materials and products regulated under environmental laws, primarily in the manufacturing and sterilization processes. While it is difficult to quantify, we believe the ongoing cost of compliance with environmental protection laws and regulations will not have a material impact on our business, financial position or results of operations.
Supply Chain Diligence and Transparency
Section 1502 of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was adopted to further the humanitarian goal of ending the violent conflict and human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries (“DRC”). This conflict has been partially financed by the exploitation and trade of tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold (so called “conflict minerals”) that originate from mines or smelters in the region. United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules adopted in August 2012 under Section 1502 require reporting companies to disclose annually on Form SD whether any such minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products they manufactured, or for which they contracted the manufacture, during the prior calendar year did, in fact, originate in the DRC and, if so, if the related revenue was used to support the conflict and/or abuses.
Some of the products we manufacture may contain tantalum, tin, tungsten and/or gold. Consequently, in compliance with SEC rules, we have adopted a policy on conflict minerals, which can be found on our website, and have implemented a supply chain due diligence and risk mitigation process with reference to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) guidance approved by the SEC to assess and report annually whether our products are “conflict free.”
We support efforts to end the violence and human rights abuses in the mining of certain minerals in the DRC. We expect our suppliers to comply with the OECD guidance and industry standards and to ensure that their supply chain conforms to our policy and the OECD guidance. We will mitigate identified risks by working directly with our suppliers; however, we may need to alter our sources of supply or modify our product design if circumstances require. We may incur certain costs in order to comply with these disclosure requirements, including for due diligence to determine the source of the subject minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. In addition, these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products throughout the supply chain beyond our control, whether or not the subject minerals are “conflict free.”
Product Liability and Insurance
The design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices and services of the types we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability claims. In addition, we provide information to health care providers and payors upon which determinations affecting medical care are made, and claims may be made against us resulting from adverse medical consequences to patients resulting from the information we provide. To protect ourselves from product liability claims, we maintain professional liability and general liability insurance on a “claims made” basis. Insurance coverage under such policies is contingent upon a policy being in effect when a claim is made, regardless of when the events which caused the claim occurred. While, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, a material product liability claim has never been made against us and we believe our insurance policies are adequate in amount and coverage for our current operations, there can be no assurance that the coverage maintained by us is sufficient to cover all future 
13

claims. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such insurance on commercially reasonable terms in the future.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 1,600 employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Available Information
