Introduction 
 Deltic Timber Corporation (Deltic or the Company) is a vertically integrated natural resources company engaged primarily in the growing and harvesting of timber and the manufacture and marketing of lumber and medium density fiberboard (MDF). Deltic owns approximately 530,000 acres of timberland, mainly in Arkansas and north Louisiana, stocked principally with Southern Pine, known in the industry as a type of softwood. The Company operates two lumber sawmills and one MDF plant, all located in Arkansas near the Companys timberlands. In addition to its timber, lumber, and MDF operations, the Company is engaged in real estate development in central Arkansas. 
 The Company is organized into four segments: (1) Woodlands, which manages all aspects of the Companys timberlands, including the harvest and sale of timber, the sales and acquisitions of timberland, the leasing of oil and gas mineral rights, royalty payments, timberland management and the leasing of hunting land; (2) Manufacturing, which consists of Deltics two sawmills that manufacture a variety of softwood lumber products and the Del-Tin Fiber plant that produces MDF; (3) Real Estate, which includes the Companys four real estate developments and a related country club operation; and (4) Corporate, which consists of executive management and the staff functions of accounting, legal, information systems, human resources, purchasing, treasury, and income tax that provide support services to the operating business units. The Company does not allocate the cost of maintaining these support functions to its operating units. Information concerning net sales, operating income, and identifiable assets attributable to each of the Companys business segments is set forth in Part II of this report in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis, and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 21, Business Segments, to the consolidated financial statements. Deltic is a calendar-year company for both financial and income tax reporting. 
 Forest Products Industry 
 Deltic is primarily a forest and wood products producer operating in a commodity-based business environment, with a diversification in real estate development. This environment is affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, housing starts, U.S. employment levels, interest rates, credit availability and associated costs, imports and exports of lumber and MDF, foreign exchange rates, inventories of new and existing homes, residential and commercial real estate foreclosures, residential and commercial repair and remodeling, residential and commercial construction, industry capacity and production levels of lumber producers, the availability of raw materials, natural gas pricing, utility costs, fuel costs, availability of contractors to harvest and thin timber, and weather conditions. The recovery of the housing market in the United States continued during 2016, with the number of housing starts increasing modestly during the year. Favorable construction conditions throughout much of the United States resulted in increased demand and supported higher average sales prices for Deltics lumber. It is expected that the historically volatile nature of the building product markets will continue to affect future demand and prices. Meanwhile, sawtimber prices have generally been more stable and typically experience a lag in timing of price changes when compared to lumber markets. The main items influencing pine sawtimber prices in Deltics operating area are demand from local mills and weather conditions. The demand in this region could increase in future years as sawmills increase capacity and production hours in anticipation of a full recovery for housing. 
 The southern U.S., in which all the Companys operations are located, is a major timber and lumber producing region. There are an estimated 215 million acres of forestland in the region, of which approximately 39 percent is currently growing softwood. Unlike other major timber-producing areas in North America, most of this acreage is privately held. The estimated breakdown of ownership of timberland in the southern U.S. is 88 percent private, 6 percent national forest, and 6 percent other public. Although there can be no assurance, management anticipates that the southern U.S. timber resource will be subject to strong demand for the foreseeable future and also believes that the South will have a strategic advantage over other U.S. timber-producing regions due to regulations, geography, and other factors.

Woodlands 
 The Company owns approximately 530,000 acres of timberland, primarily in Arkansas and north Louisiana. Management considers these timberlands to be Deltics most valuable asset and the harvest of Company-owned stumpage to be a stable source of income. The Company follows Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) Standards that promote sustainable forest management in North America through the use of core principles, objectives, performance measures and indicators to protect water quality, biodiversity, wildlife habitat, species at risk, and forests which have exceptional conservation value. The timberlands are actively managed to maximize their long-term value and increase productivity through responsible harvest plans, a commitment to reforestation, careful road construction, and other best management practices. The timber harvested from Company timberlands is either converted to lumber in the Companys sawmills or sold in the domestic market. The Woodlands fee timber that is supplied to the Companys sawmills is transferred at prices that approximate market in the sawmills operating area. Deltics strategy for growth includes the acquisition of additional timberland suitable for growing pine sawtimber in its current operating regions. This timberland management strategy also includes the identification of non-strategic timberland acres and higher and better use lands for possible sale. Timberland ownership also provides ancillary value through oil and gas lease rentals and royalties and recreational hunting land leases. 
 The estimated breakdown of the Companys timberland acreage at year-end 2016 consisted of the following: 
 

 | Acres | 
Pine plantation | | 344,400
Pine forest | | 121,100
Hardwood forest | | 7,900 
Other | | 57,000 
Total | | 530,400

 The Companys timberlands are well diversified by age class. Pine plantations are primarily less than 30 years old, with the majority ranging in age from 5 to 25 years. The timberland classified as pine forest are primarily stands of natural pine and contains mature timber that is ready to be harvested over the next several years and includes streamside-management zones. At the approximate age of 20 years, pine plantations begin transitioning from pine pulpwood to pine sawtimber. 
 Timber Inventory. The Companys estimated pine sawtimber inventory is calculated for each tract by utilizing growth formulas based on representative sample tracts and tree counts for various diameter classifications. The calculation of pine inventory is subject to periodic adjustments based on sample cruises and actual volumes harvested. The hardwood inventory shown in the following table is an approximation; therefore, the physical quantity of such timber may vary significantly from this approximation.

Estimated inventory of standing timber as of December 31, 2016, consisted of the following: 
 

 | EstimatedVolume(Tons) | 
Pine timber | | 
Sawtimber | | 14,840,000
Pulpwood | | 6,026,000 
Hardwood timber | | 
Sawtimber | | 1,429,000 
Pulpwood | | 808,000 

 The Companys annual harvest of pine sawtimber over the last several years has been used primarily by the sawmills of the Manufacturing segment, but at times it may be sold to third parties. Products that can be manufactured from this resource include dimension lumber, boards, and timbers, which are used mainly in residential construction. Deltics hardwood sawtimber is sold to third parties and is primarily used in the production of railroad ties, flooring, and pallets. Logs with a diameter of less than nine inches are considered to be pulpwood. Harvests of both pine and hardwood pulpwood are sold to third parties for use primarily in the manufacture of paper products. 
 Timber Growth. Timber growth rate is an important variable for forest products companies since it ultimately determines how much timber can be harvested on a sustainable basis. A higher growth rate permits larger annual harvests as replacement timber regenerates. Growth rates vary depending on species, location, age, and forestry management practices. The growth rate, net of mortality, for Deltics Southern Pine timber averages five to six percent of standing inventory per annum. The Company considers a 30 to 35 year rotation optimal for most of its pine plantations. 
 Timberland Management. Forestry practices vary by geographic region and depend on factors such as soil productivity, weather, terrain, and the species, size, age, and stocking of timber. The Company actively manages its timberlands based on these factors and other relevant information to increase productivity and maximize the long-term value of its timber assets. In general, the Companys timberland management involves select harvesting and thinning operations, reforestation, cull timber removal programs, and the introduction of genetically improved seedlings. 
 Deltic developed and currently operates its own seed orchard. Seeds from the orchard are grown by third parties to produce genetically improved seedlings for planting. These seedlings are developed through selective cross-pollination to produce trees with preferred characteristics, such as higher growth rates, fewer limbs, straighter trunks, and greater resistance to disease. However, this process does not involve genetic engineering. The seedlings are used when a site is completely replanted, as in the case of a final harvest of a mature stand. Primarily using seedlings grown from seeds produced at the orchard facility, the Company planted 13,803 acres in 2016, 15,267 acres in 2015, and 14,182 acres in 2014. In addition, the Company also replants part or all of any recently planted pine plantation acreage where there has been a high mortality rate. The Company meets or exceeds, in all material respects, the reforestation recommendations of the Arkansas Forestry Commissions Best Management Practices. In addition, the Company has been certified under the SFI program with regards to its timberland management practices. 
 The Companys silviculture program is designed to control undesirable, competitive vegetation in its forests and to increase pine growth rates and reproduction. The number of acres treated by Deltic under this program were 10,268, 12,133, and 8,106 in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. In addition, the Company actively utilizes commercial thinning practices. Commercial thinning operations consist of the selective removal of trees within a stand, usually a plantation, to improve overall timber productivity and value by enhancing the growth of the remaining trees while generating revenues from the harvest.

Harvest Plans. Management views the timberlands as an asset with substantial inherent value beyond supplying its sawmills. The Company intends to continue to manage the timberlands on a sustainable-yield basis that permits regeneration of the timberlands over time and has no plans to harvest timber on an ongoing basis at levels that would diminish its timber inventory. In 2016, the Company harvested 777,182 tons of pine sawtimber from its timberlands. Under the current plan, Deltic intends to harvest up to 775,000 tons of pine sawtimber in 2017. The Companys harvest plans are generally designed to project multi-year harvest schedules and are updated at least annually. Harvest plans are reviewed on a monthly basis to monitor performance and to make any necessary modifications to the plans in response to changing forestry conditions, market conditions, contractual obligations, regulatory limitations, weather conditions, and other relevant factors. Harvest plans can be affected by the projections of demand, price, availability of timber from other sources, and other factors that may be outside of the Companys control; therefore, actual harvesting levels may vary. Management believes that the Companys harvest plans are sufficiently flexible to permit modification in response to fluctuations in the markets for logs and lumber. 
 Access. Substantially all of the timberlands are accessible by a system of low impact and low maintenance roads. Deltic generally uses third-party contractors to conduct construction and maintenance of these roads. In addition, the Company buys, sells, and exchanges access easements and cooperates with other area forest products companies, private landowners, and the U.S. Forest Service, as needed. 
 Wildlife Management. Deltic actively leases Company lands for recreational hunting purposes. As such, it monitors wildlife resources on Company property. The Company complies with the U.S. Endangered Species Act and strives to provide, maintain, and/or enhance habitats for all species with special biological or ecological concerns. The Company employs a wildlife biologist to manage these resources. For the years ended 2016, 2015, and 2014, the Company had hunting lease revenues totaling $3,122,000, $3,031,000, and $2,685,000, respectively. The Company leased the hunting rights on approximately 501,982, 505,000, and 517,000 acres in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 
 Client-Land Management. In addition to managing its own timberlands, Deltic also manages timberlands owned by others under management contracts with one-year renewable terms. This program provided harvest planning, silvicultural improvements, and maintenance work for approximately 74,849 acres in 2016. 
 Timberland Acquisitions. The Company has an ongoing program to acquire additional timberland suited for growing pine sawtimber in its current operating area. These acquisitions are designed to enable the Company to expand its timber inventory which will allow the Company to increase the annual harvest and could be used to maintain or increase the volume of logs supplied to its sawmills from its own timberlands when economically feasible. 
 Timberlands considered for purchase are evaluated based on the proximity to mills, site index, timber stocking, and growth potential and may include tracts that range from cutover to fully-stocked. Approximately 237,500 acres of strategically located pine timberlands have been added since the 1996 inception of the acquisition program. Individual land purchases have ranged in size from 3 acres to 41,400 acres. The Company intends to continue to focus its acquisition program on timberlands in its current geographic area. Unlike other timber-producing areas of North America, most of the timberland in the southern U.S. is privately held, making it potentially available for acquisition. There can be no assurance that timber properties suitable for acquisition will be identified by the Company or that, once identified, such properties will ultimately be acquired by the Company. 
 Land Sales. In 1999, the Company initiated a program to identify for possible sale non-strategic timberlands and higher and better use lands. Approximately 46,000 acres of non-strategic timberlands have been sold since 1999. 
 Oil and Gas Revenues. Timberland ownership also provides ancillary value through oil and gas lease rentals and royalties. The Company receives oil and gas lease rental revenues when it agrees to grant certain mineral rights to third parties for periods that generally range from three to five years. Once production begins on leased mineral acres, oil and gas royalty income payments are received. Deltic earned oil and gas lease rental revenues of $358,000, $780,000, and $1,662,000, in 2016, 2015, and 
 
6 
 
 2014, respectively, on related leased acres of 8,400, 8,100, and 22,000, respectively. For the years ended 2016, 2015, and 2014, the Company recorded revenues of $1,750,000, $3,118,000, and $4,872,000, respectively from oil and gas royalties. Severance taxes deducted from oil and gas royalty revenues were $530,000, $537,000, and $607,000, in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The total of all net oil and gas operating income as a percentage of the Woodlands operating income was 8 percent, 17 percent, and 31 percent, in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 
 Manufacturing 
 Deltic owns and operates two sawmills and one MDF plant. The Companys sawmills are located at Ola in central Arkansas (the Ola Mill) and at Waldo in south Arkansas (the Waldo Mill). Each mill is strategically located near significant portions of the Companys timberlands, which provide a stable source of raw material stumpage for use in the manufacture of dimension lumber, boards, and timbers. These lumber products are sold primarily to wholesale distributors, lumber treaters, large retailers, industrial accounts, and truss manufacturers in the South and Midwest and are used mainly in residential construction, roof trusses, remanufactured products, and laminated beams. The mills employ modern technology in order to improve efficiency, reduce labor costs, maximize utilization of the timber resource, and maintain high quality standards of production with safety being one of the highest priorities. Logs processed into lumber are obtained from the Companys timberlands and from public and private landowners. The Company selects logs for processing in its mills based on size, grade, and the prevailing market price. The Ola Mill is equipped for maximum utilization of smaller diameter logs, while the Waldo Mill can process both smaller and larger diameter logs. 
 Combined annual permitted capacity of the two mills at December 31, 2016, was 450 million board feet (MMBF). The Companys lumber output increased to 274 MMBF in 2016 compared to 259 MMBF in 2015, as production was increased to match market demand. Adapting production levels to demand, improving mill efficiencies, and controlling manufacturing costs remain as key strategies for managing the current cycle of the lumber market. 
 Deltics MDF plant is located at El Dorado, Arkansas, near the Waldo Mill, and it manufactures and markets MDF under the trade name of Solidium. Construction of the plant was completed, and initial production began, in 1998. Deltic formerly owned 50 percent of this plant as a joint venture and has owned 100 percent of the plant since April 1, 2013. The plants rated annual production capacity is 150 million square feet (MMSF), on a  3/4-inch basis, of MDF. The plants production of MDF was 104 MMSF in 2016, 93 MMSF in 2015, and 114 MMSF in 2014. The volume of MDF produced in 2015 was reduced due to the downtime caused by a fire in the press area in March 2015. 
 MDF is used primarily in furniture, kitchen cabinets, laminate flooring, store fixtures, door parts, and molding and is sold mostly to industrial distributors, wholesalers, retailers, and manufacturers. MDF is manufactured from sawmill residuals such as chips, shavings, and sawdust which are combined with an adhesive bond and are joined together under heat and pressure. Although the technology has existed for decades, continued improvements in the manufacture of MDF have increased both the quality and market acceptance of the product. MDF, with its real-wood appearance and the ability to be finely milled and to accept a variety of finishes, competes primarily with plywood and lumber. 
 The MDF plant provides an additional outlet for wood chip production from the Companys mills, primarily the Waldo Mill. The Company expects to continue to transfer a significant portion of its Waldo Mills residual wood shavings and chip production to the MDF plant. During 2016, 2015, and 2014, Deltic sold approximately $6,255,000, $4,699,000, and $5,215,000, respectively of these lumber manufacturing by-products to the MDF plant at approximate market value. 
 Capital Projects. Deltic has invested capital in its sawmills in recent years in order to increase production capacity and efficiency, decrease costs, improve safety, and expand their product mix. Major capital projects completed at the Ola Mill over the past several years include: (1) installation of small-log line; (2) kiln replacement and conversions of some existing kilns to continuous feed; and (3) installation of second edger.

At the Waldo Mill, major capital projects over the past several years include: (1) conversion of kilns to continuous feed; and (2) modifications to boilers. 
 At the MDF plant, major capital projects included: (1) rebuild of face refiner; (2) replacement of heat energy refractory; and (3) replacement of press belts. 
 Raw Materials. In 2016, the Companys two sawmills processed 1,191,880 tons of logs, either harvested from its timberlands or purchased from private landowners and the U.S. Forest Service. Essentially all of the Woodlands segments harvest of pine sawtimber was transferred to the mills and provided 68 percent of the sawmills total raw material requirements. 
 Various factors, including environmental and endangered species concerns, have limited, and will likely continue to limit, the amount of timber offered for sale by the U.S. Forest Service. Because of this reduced availability of federal timber for harvesting, the Company believes that its supply of timber from its timberlands is a significant competitive advantage. Deltic has historically supplied a significant portion of the timber processed in the sawmills from its timberlands. 
 In order to operate its sawmills economically, the Company relies on purchases of timber from third parties to supplement timber harvests from its own timberlands. The Company has an active timber procurement function for each of its sawmills. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had under contract 197,599 tons of timber on land owned by other parties, including the U.S. Forest Service, which is expected to be harvested over the next three years. During 2016, the Company harvested third-party stumpage and purchased logs from third parties totaling 396,892 tons. Of this volume, purchases from the U.S. Forest Service represented eight percent. The balance of such purchased volume was acquired from private lands. 
 There is a substantial amount of privately owned pine timber acreage in proximity to each of Deltics sawmills; therefore, the sources of private timber are many and diverse. As additional sawmills in the area come into production, the demand will likely increase and may lead to higher stumpage prices. The key factors in a landowners determination of whether to sell timber to the Company are price, the Companys relationships with logging contractors, and the ability of the Company to demonstrate the quality of its logging practices to landowners. Typically, a landowner will be more likely to sell timber to a forest products company whose own land has been responsibly managed and harvested. 
 The MDF plant uses wood chips and shavings from Deltics sawmills as well as from other area lumber producers. The plant used 276,234 tons of fiber in 2016 of which 153,501 tons, or 56 percent, was provided by the sawmills. Other raw materials used by the plant include resins and wax. The sources, availability, and pricing of these materials are considered reliable. 
 Residual Wood Products. The Company pursues waste minimization practices at both of its sawmills and seeks to sell all marketable by-products. Wood chips and shavings are usually sold to paper mills, particle board mills, or transferred to the MDF plant, and bark is frequently sold for use as fuel. Bark, sawdust, shavings, and wood chips that cannot be sold are used as fuel to fire the boilers that heat the drying kilns. The Company expects to continue to use a significant portion of its Waldo Mills residual wood shavings and chip production at the MDF plant. 
 Transportation. Each mill facility and the MDF plant have the capability to ship lumber and MDF products by truck or rail. 
 Cyclical Market. While the cyclicality of the lumber market may occasionally require the interruption or reduction of operations at one or both of the Companys sawmills and MDF plant, suspension of manufacturing activities is unusual. Management is not currently anticipating any interruption of operations at any of Deltics manufacturing facilities, but no assurance can be given that market conditions or other factors will not render such an action economically advisable in the future.

Real Estate 
 The Companys real estate operations were initiated to add value to former timberland which is strategically located in the growth corridor of west Little Rock, Arkansas. Development activities began in 1985 with the construction of Chenal Ridge, the initial, 85-lot neighborhood in Chenal Valley on the western edge of the Little Rock city limits. Since that time, the Company has been developing the remainder of Chenal Valley, a premier upscale planned community, with approximately 4,300 acres of residential and commercial properties centered around a country club with two championship golf courses designed by Robert Trent Jones, Jr. The property has been developed in stages, and real estate sales to-date have consisted primarily of residential lots sold to builders or individuals and commercial acreage sold to area businesses or developers. All developed acreage in Chenal Valley has been annexed by the City of Little Rock. In 2014, Wildwood Place, a small-lot development located near Chenal Valley consisting of approximately 100 acres, was opened for development. Outside of Chenal Valley, Deltic created Chenal Downs, a 400-acre equestrian themed residential development with controlled access, featuring secluded five-acre lots, located just outside the Little Rock city limits. Red Oak Ridge, Deltics first development outside the Little Rock area, is located in Hot Springs, Arkansas and is an 800-acre upscale community being developed for residential, resort, or retirement living, that has been annexed by that city. 
 Residential Development. Residential lots were first offered for sale in Chenal Valley during the second half of 1986 with closings beginning in 1987. As of December 31, 2016, 2,980 lots have been developed in 37 neighborhoods, and 2,903 lots have been sold, with about 2,788 residences constructed or under construction. When fully developed, Chenal Valley could include approximately 4,600 single-family residences. However, the actual number of residences in Chenal Valley will depend on final land usages and lot densities. The Company has developed lots in a wide variety of market segments. Lot size has ranged from 0.2 acres to 2.25 acres, and the lot sales price over the life of the development has ranged from $25,000 per lot to over $335,000 per lot. Residential lots in Wildwood Place, Deltics new development located near Chenal Valley, were offered beginning in 2014 and all were sold as of December 31, 2016, with addition lot development plans for 2017 and 2018. 
 The first phase of Chenal Downs was opened in December 1997, followed by a second phase in November 2000. By the end of 2016, 66 of the 76 developed lots were sold. Lot prices in Chenal Downs range from $89,000 to approximately $187,000. In Red Oak Ridge, the first two neighborhoods were offered for sale in 1998, with a third neighborhood offered in late 2005. Many of these lots overlook one of two private lakes. These neighborhoods offer a choice of either estate-sized home sites or garden-home sized lots. As of the end of 2016, 96 of the 135 lots offered have been sold, with prices ranging from $30,000 per lot to $195,000 per lot. 
 Commercial Development. Commercial development activity to-date has consisted of the sale of approximately 426 acres, including approximately 33.9 acres in 2016 and 2 acres in 2014, while there were no commercial acreage sales in 2015. Commercial property sales have consisted of retail store locations, an office building constructed by the Company on a nine-acre site, multi-family residence sites, convenience store locations, a bank office building site, a site for a 38-acre open-air shopping center, a 37-acre site for a medical center, and outparcels surrounding a retail center constructed and owned by the Company. Under current development plans, Chenal Valley will include approximately 826 acres of commercial development when fully completed. 
 In 1998 construction was completed on the initial section of Rahling Road, a major connector street to Chenal Parkway, and it provided greater access to Chenal Valleys commercial acreage. Located at the center of this commercial property is a Company-owned 35,000-square-foot retail center. The retail center was completed in early 2000 and offers retail and office space for lease. The center is surrounded by 17 outparcels, ranging in size from 0.2 to 1.8 acres, and 12 of these outparcels have been sold to date. St. Vincent Hospital opened its Chenal-based medical center in 2011, and the success of the shopping center known as The Promenade at Chenal continues to stimulate interest in the Companys nearby available commercial property. 
 No commercial acreage is included in Chenal Downs, and a small amount of commercial property is planned for Red Oak Ridge. The Company will begin to develop and offer commercial sites in Red Oak Ridge as population density increases.

Infrastructure. Infrastructure and other improvements to support the development and sale of residential and commercial properties are funded directly by the Company or through real property improvement districts. Such properties are developed only when sufficient demand exists and substantially all infrastructure is completed. Future infrastructure investments are primarily for the development and sale of additional property. 
 Development Amenities. In connection with its Chenal Valley development, the Company developed Chenal Country Club, consisting of the earlier-described golf courses, a clubhouse, and related facilities for use by club members. Since its original construction, Deltic has undertaken substantial remodeling and expansion of the clubhouse to fulfill membership needs. In addition, the Company has built three community parks within the Chenal Valley development for the benefit of the residents of the developed residential areas. 
 Chenal Downs has been developed around an equestrian center, consisting of stables and a training facility, and also includes bridle trails throughout the development. Red Oak Ridges primary amenities currently consist of two lakes and a community park constructed by the Company. 
 Home Construction. Historically, the Companys focus with regards to residential real estate development has been on lot development only. However, Deltic has constructed a limited number of speculative homes within its Red Oak Ridge development located in Hot Springs, Arkansas. At December 31, 2016, Deltic had three of these constructed homes available for sale. 
 Future Development. A number of factors have added significant value to the undeveloped portion of Chenal Valley. Such factors include: (1) the overall success of Chenal Valley as a residential development and its image as one of the premier developments in central Arkansas; (2) the continued westward growth of Little Rock; (3) the Companys investment in infrastructure in the area; and (4) the established residential base which is now large enough to support commercial development. Management expects the undeveloped portion of Chenal Valley to provide growth and development opportunities in the future. 
 Chenal Downs has been fully developed, but development of Red Oak Ridge is in the early stages, currently consisting of the first three of several planned neighborhoods, the initial infrastructure placement, and two man-made lakes that serve as the core amenity. 
 Undeveloped Acreage. The success of Chenal Valley has increased the value of the Companys undeveloped real estate surrounding and within the development, though there were no sales of undeveloped real estate in the most recent three-year period. 
 Products and Competition 
 The Companys principal products are timber, timberland, softwood lumber products (primarily finished lumber), MDF, residual wood products, hunting land leases, oil and gas lease rentals and royalties, and real estate. 
 Timber. Timber harvested from the timberlands is utilized by the Companys sawmills or sold to third parties. The Companys sales of timber to third parties accounted for approximately two percent of consolidated net sales in 2016, 2015, and 2014. The Company competes in the domestic timber market with numerous private industrial and non-industrial land and timber owners. Competitive factors with respect to the domestic timber market generally include price, species and grade, proximity to wood manufacturing facilities, and accessibility. 
 Land Sales. Timberland sold by the Company to third parties consists of both non-strategic timberland, including hardwood bottomland suitable for recreational use, and lands with potential for higher and better use and amounted to less than one percent of consolidated net sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014. 
 
10 
 
Lumber and MDF Products. The Companys sawmills produce a wide variety of products, including dimension lumber, boards, and timbers. Lumber is sold primarily to wholesaler distributors, lumber treaters, and truss manufacturers in the South and Midwest and is used in residential construction, roof trusses, and laminated beams. Lumber sales as a percentage of consolidated net sales were approximately 45 percent, in 2016, 2015 and 2014. MDF is sold primarily to wholesalers, industrial distributors, retailers, and manufacturers in the United States and is used in residential remodeling and the manufacturing of flooring, cabinets, molding, furniture, and store fixtures. Deltic began reporting MDF sales effective April 1, 2013, when it acquired 100 percent of the Del-Tin Fiber plant, formerly a joint venture reported as an equity method investment. MDF sales as a percentage of consolidated net sales were 26 percent in 2016, 27 percent in 2015, and 29 percent in 2014. 
 The forest products market is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of products. In particular, competition in the commodity-grade lumber and MDF markets in which the Company competes is primarily based on price and availability. Deltic competes with larger publicly held forest products companies operating in the U.S., many of which have significantly greater financial resources than the Company, as well as privately held lumber producers. The Company also competes with producers in Canada and overseas. 
 Deltics management expects the Companys products to experience additional increased competition from engineered wood products and other substitute products. However, due to the geographic location of Deltics timberlands and its high-quality timber, the Companys active timber management program, strategically located and efficient sawmill operations, and highly motivated workforce, Deltic has been able to compete effectively. 
 Residual Wood Products. The Companys sawmills produce wood chips, shavings, sawdust, and bark as by-products of the conversion process. During both 2016 and 2015, third-party sales of these residual products accounted for five percent of Deltics consolidated net sales compared to four percent in 2014. Wood chips are the primary source of residual sales and are typically used at the MDF plant or sold to paper mills. In 2016 Deltics sawmills produced 340,841 tons of wood chips and a significant portion of these wood chips are used by the Company in its manufacture of MDF. 
 Hunting Land Leases. Deltic leases hunting rights for its Woodlands to individuals and groups with its main competitors being other landowners. Per-acre price and location are the primary factors in leasing woodland hunting rights. Hunting lease revenues accounted for one percent of consolidated net sales in 2016, 2015, and 2014. 
 Oil and Gas. The Company has approximately 16,600 net mineral acres of Company-owned land either currently under lease or held by production. Once production begins, oil and gas royalty payments are received. Oil and gas lease rental payments are recognized as income over the term of the lease, and oil and gas royalty payments are recognized as income when received. Oil and gas lease rental income accounted for less than one percent of consolidated net sales in both 2016 and 2015, and one percent in 2014. Oil and gas royalty revenue accounted for less than one percent in 2016 and two percent of consolidated net sales in both 2015 and 2014. Oil and gas royalty income is dependent upon the number of producing wells, volume extracted, and market prices, none of which are controlled by the Company. 
 Real Estate. The Company develops and markets residential lots and commercial sites and also sells undeveloped acreage. Residential lots are sold to homebuilders and individuals, while commercial sites are sold to developers and businesses. Deltic generally provides the supporting infrastructure as part of the development. Other landowners or developers are Deltics competitors in its real estate markets and are seeking the same customer base, with each competitor marketing the benefits of its site locations, related infrastructure, or amenities. During 2016, the sales of residential lots and commercial sites as a percentage of consolidated net sales were eight percent, and were four percent in 2014 and 2015. The sale of commercial property can have a significant impact on the Companys sales but is unpredictable and sporadic.

Seasonality 
 The Companys operating segments are subject to variances in financial results due to several seasonal factors. Increased housing starts and home remodeling projects during the spring usually push up lumber prices. Forestry operations generally incur silvicultural treatment expenses in the third quarter, because they are applied during the fall season in order to achieve maximum effectiveness. 
Environmental Matters 
 The Company is subject to extensive and changing federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including laws relating to air and water quality, greenhouse gas emissions, the use of herbicides on timberlands, regulation of wetlands, and the protection of endangered species. Environmental legislation and regulations, and the interpretation and enforcement thereof, are expected to become increasingly stringent. The Company has made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with such requirements in the ordinary course of its operations. Historically, these expenditures have not been material, and the Company expects that this will continue to be the case. Liability under certain environmental regulations may be imposed without regard to fault or the legality of the original actions and may be joint and several with other responsible parties. As a result, in addition to ongoing compliance costs, the Company may be subject to liability for activities undertaken on its properties prior to its ownership or operation and for activities by third parties, including tenants. The Company is not involved with any such sites at this time. The Company leases the rights to drill for oil and gas on some of its lands to third parties. Pursuant to these leases, the lessee is to indemnify the Company from environmental liability relating to the lessees operations. Based on its present knowledge, the Company is not aware of any facts that indicate the Company will be required to incur any material costs relating to environmental matters. Under currently applicable laws and regulations, the Company believes environmental matters are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 
 The federal Endangered Species Act (the Act) protects species threatened with possible extinction and restricts timber harvesting activities on private and federal lands. Certain of the Companys timberlands are subject to such restrictions due to the presence on the lands of the red-cockaded woodpecker, a species protected under the Act. The presences of numerous endangered and/or threated aquatic species occur across Deltics timberlands in both operational regions. At this time there are no significant restrictions, however, there can be no assurance that the presence of these species or the discovery of other protected species will not subject the Company to future harvesting restrictions. 
 Congress has been considering certain climate control legislation for some time. Due to uncertainties with any proposed legislation, it is difficult to make an assessment of the impact of such legislation upon the Companys operations until such time as such legislation has been passed, codified, and the appropriate regulation promulgated. The Company will continue to monitor the legislative process and any possible future legislation or regulatory actions and their effects upon its operations.
