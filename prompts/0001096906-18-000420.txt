ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General
 
The following is a summary of some of the information contained in this document.  Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this document to "we," "us," "our," "GIFA," or the "Company" are references to GIFA, Inc. (formerly Firefish, Inc.), a Nevada corporation
Overview & 2017 Matters:  Actions of September and October 2017 & Change of Control
 
We were originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 29, 2008 under the name Firefish, Inc.
 
On September 26, 2017 the Company's then President and sole Director, Ralph M. Amato delivered to the Company an aggregate of 66,550,660 shares of the Company's Common Stock and the same were returned to the Company as treasury stock.
 
These shares had been originally issued to the Company's founder, Harshawardhan Shetty, M.B.A. who had resigned previously. All of the shares were subsequently cancelled and became treasury stock and Mr. Amato also resigned as an officer and director and elected Mr. Ilksen Yesilada as the Company's sole officer and director.
 
Following the election of Mr. Yesilada as a Director of the Company, Mr. Yesilada elected Yusuf Kisa to serve as a Director of the Company and the Company's Board of Directors elected Mr. Ilksen Yesilada as Chief Executive Officer and Treasurer, Mr. Yusuf Kisa as President, Ms. Hulya Sonmez as Secretary and Mr. William M. Aul as Assistant Secretary. The Company also issued an aggregate 100,000,000 shares of common stock to persons associated with Mr. Ilksen Yesilada pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act") and Regulation S as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder.  All of the 100,000,000 shares were issued with a restricted securities legend and the Company did not pay or incur any fees or commissions to any third party in connection with the issuance of these shares.  All of the shares were issued for services rendered and valued at $0.001 par value.
 
On October 17, 2017 the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change the Company's name from Firefish, Inc. to GIFA, Inc. (the "Amendment"). The Amendment also reduced the Company's authorized Common Stock to 500,000,000 and it authorized an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of the Company's Preferred Stock.  And in the case of the Preferred Stock, the Amendment provided that the Company's Board of Directors may designate and issue, without obtaining the approval of the Company's common stockholders, one or more series of the Company's Preferred Stock each with such rights and privileges as the Company's Board of Directors determines.
 
As a result of the foregoing, the Company has undergone a change of control as more fully set forth herein.

The Company also moved its offices to 1660 Hotel Circle North, Suite 207, San Diego, California 92108 at which its telephone number is 619-497-2555.  The office is provided to the Company on a rent free basis.
 
Under the terms of the agreement with Mr. Amato, the Company has agreed to undertake the planned divestiture of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary (domiciled in India) in which the Company conducts its current business (the "Subsidiary") and the planned divestiture is to be undertaken via a sale of the Subsidiary to Mr. Shetty (the "Divestiture") in connection with an exchange and forgiveness of certain debt owed by the Company to Mr. Shetty so that the Divestiture will be immediately preceded by the Company's planned acquisition of certain shares of the common stock of GIFA Holding Limited, a corporation domiciled in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (the "Acquisition"). Both the planned Divestiture and the planned Acquisition are subject to certain additional anticipated actions and agreements and the precise terms and conditions upon which each of these transactions are to be completed is not known at this time. We cannot assure you that we will successfully complete the Divestiture, the Acquisition, or both of them.
 
In connection with the planned Divestiture, we are also obligated to timely file a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission reporting on the resignation of Mr. Amato and Mr. Shetty and also the election of the Company's officers and Directors as successors.
 
See Part II., Item 9B below.
 
Overview of Current Business Operations
 
Currently, and prior to the anticipated closing of the planned Divestiture and the planned Acquisition, we offer mobile and internet marketing services to retailers. We also offer educational services to young learners and young adults. On an annual basis, in January and February we host an English, Math and Science competency competition referred to as the Primary Olympiad. Both our services are currently offered only in India. In India our offices are located at 76/F Kamgar Nagar, Kurla (East), Mumbai 400024.
 
We were originally started by an Indian engineer and our founder, CEO Harshawardhan Shetty, M.B.A., to offer social networking services and ancillary offerings to the 18-24 year old, lower-middle class demographic.
 
To serve this need, we built a robust social networking platform with wide ranging features. We also developed two ancillary lines of businesses that leveraged our user base and developed expertise within our target market (1) text message advertising services to retailers wishing to market their services to our social networking community and (2) educational services to current and potential members of our social networking community such as English language training/certification and English competency competitions.
 
Under our existing business, our current revenues are chiefly derived from text message advertising services to retailers, competition entry fees for English, Math and Science competency competitions and consulting fees for English language training/certification services.
 
In our existing business and for our text message advertising services, we have built a website, a mobile advertising platform that enables retailers to manage their advertising campaigns to our highly segmented database of consumers. While our database was seeded with users from our social networking community, we have since then significantly increased the size of our database via acquisition of users through events and purchased databases.
 
Our English, Math and Science competency competition referred to as the Primary Olympiad is an annual program and competition for young learners. We have built a website for the Primary Olympiad – http://www.primaryolympiad.com. The examination is held annually in January and February.
 
Industry Background – Existing Business
 
In general and parallel to the growth of the social networking industry and its associated internet advertising revenues, the mobile advertising industry has also seen rapid growth in the last five (5) years. This rapid growth is a result of greater and greater numbers of people owning smart phones such as iPhones and Android phones. These users then tend to use applications on their smart phones which in turn carry mobile advertising. While, one of the applications that smart phone users use is social networking applications, typically, smart phone users use many different applications from many different application creators on their phone.
  2
 
Google Admob and Apple's iAd platform serve as marketplaces to connect advertisers to application creators. Consumers that download the applications are then shown the advertisement.
 
In connection with our existing business and specifically in India, the number of smart phones is quite low but the number of feature phones exceeds 700 million units. In feature phones, advertising content appears as a text message. The mobile advertising industry in India is expected to grow from its current size of $5 million to over $400 million by 2015 driven both by tremendous mobile phone penetration and the growth of the organized retail industry. While in the US, Admob and iAd offer retailers a systematic mechanism to reach consumers, there is not such mechanism for retailers trying to reach the large feature phone text message consumer.
 
GIFA Overview -- Existing Operations and Business
 
Currently our existing mobile advertising services to retailers we have developed an online platform. This platform allows retailers to log into their account, choose a consumer segment to send their advertising message to selecting age, gender, location and income levels, compose the advertising message to send, personalize the message via addressing the consumer by name, and schedule the message for later delivery. Retailers can also pay online. In addition, retailers can also call us to fully manage their advertising campaign. While our database of users on the mobile advertising platform was seeded by our users from social networking services, we have significantly grown the size of our database via user acquisition events and database purchases.
 
Our existing business involving training/certification/competition services consist of (1) the Primary Olympiad (http://www.primaryolympiad.com) an annual English, Math and Science competency program and competition for young learners with the examination being conducted in January and February each year (2) Spoken English classes (3) English certification programs in partnership with non-governmental agencies and state governments.
 
Competition on Existing Business
 
Our existing business does not fit into one single industry. +Our competition for our existing business comes from the mobile advertising industry and from the K-12 education services industry, both of which are rapidly growing. As a result, the number and sophistication of competitors are also rapidly growing.  We hope to distinguish ourselves from these competitors by the combination of services we offer, the high quality of our websites and technology, and our focus on our core demographic.
 
AdMob, incorporated in 2006, is one of the world's largest mobile advertising companies offering advertising solutions for many mobile platforms, including Android, iOS, webOS, Flash Lite, Windows Phone 7 and all standard mobile web browsers. In November 2009 it was acquired by Google for $750 million. It serves more than 40 billion mobile banner and text ads per month across mobile Web sites and handset applications.
 
iAd is a mobile advertising platform developed by Apple Inc. for its iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad line of mobile devices allowing third-party developers to directly embed advertisements into their applications.
 
Founded in India in 2007, InMobi is the largest independent mobile advertising network in the world. The company launched in the U.S. and Europe in early 2010. It is backed by Silicon Valley venture firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Sherpalo Ventures, and Mumbai Angels. The InMobi network reaches over 350 Million consumers around the globe. There are over 10,000 publishers and 2,000 advertisers in the network.
 
Competition with  our existing services also comes from those providing education services to K-12 schools in India, specifically those conducting school competitions and those providing school-based assessments.
 
Intellectual Property – Existing Business
 
We have not filed for any patent and/or copyright protection for our existing websites, proprietary technologies and/or planned products. For our existing business, we intend to rely on trade secret protection and/or confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, business partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite certain precautions taken by us, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use our intellectual property that we use in our existing business without authorization. This risk may be increased due to the lack of any patent and/or copyright protection.  If any of our existing proprietary rights used in our existing business are misappropriated or we are forced to defend our intellectual property rights, we will have to incur substantial costs. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, including diverting the time and effort of our senior management, and could disrupt our business, as well as have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Management will from time to time determine whether applying for patent and copyright protection is appropriate for us. We have no guarantee that, if filed, any applications for our existing business will be granted or, if awarded, whether they will offer us any meaningful protection from other companies in our business. Furthermore, any patent or copyrights that we may be granted may be held by a court to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and subject us to awards for damages.

For our existing business, we cannot be certain that our existing websites and our proprietary technologies will not infringe upon patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. While we know of no basis for any claims of this type, the existence of and ownership of intellectual property can be difficult to verify and we have not made an exhaustive search of all patent filings. Additionally, most patent applications are kept confidential for twelve to eighteen months, or longer, and we would not be able to be aware of potentially conflicting claims that they make. For our existing business we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to the intellectual property of others in the ordinary course of our business. If we are found to have violated the intellectual property rights of others, we may be enjoined from using such intellectual property, and we may incur licensing fees or be forced to develop alternative technology or obtain other licenses. In addition, we may incur substantial expenses in defending against these third party infringement claims and be diverted from devoting time to our business and operational issues, regardless of the merits of any such claim.
 
Government Regulation – Existing Business
 
Our existing business, websites and our proprietary technologies may be subject to increasing regulation of content, consumer privacy, distribution and online hosting and delivery in the key territories in which we desire to conduct business. If we do not successfully respond to these regulations, our business may suffer. Legislation is continually being introduced that may affect both the content of proprietary technologies and their distribution.  For example, data and consumer protection laws in the United States and Europe impose various restrictions on web sites. Those rules vary by territory although the Internet recognizes no geographical boundaries. Any one or more of these factors could harm our business by limiting the proposed features we plan on incorporating into the website and proprietary technologies, by limiting the size of the potential market for our products, and by requiring costly additional differentiation in the website and proprietary technologies for different territories to address varying regulations.
Internet Websites –Existing Business
 
With respect to our existing business, we have secured the rights to the internet domain names www.firefish.in, and www.primaryolympiad.com.
 
Planned Divestiture and Planned Acquisition
 
As a result of the September and October 2017 Actions, we anticipate that we will enter into an agreement for the planned Divestiture of our existing business (as conducted by our Subsidiary domiciled in India) with the Subsidiary to be sold and transferred to our founder Mr. Harshawardhan Shetty generally in exchange for his forgiveness of certain debts owed to him by the Company. While the specific terms of the planned Divestiture have not yet been determined we do anticipate that the planned Divestiture will be undertaken in conjunction with our planned acquisition of the capital stock of GIFA Holding Limited, a corporation domiciled in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (the "Acquisition"). We cannot assure you that we will successfully complete the Divestiture, the Acquisition, or both of them.
 
Both the planned Divestiture and the planned Acquisition are transactions that clearly result in a significant change in our business, operations, cash flow, and profitability.  We anticipate that if we are successful in our negotiations we will focus our managerial and financial resources in completing the planned Acquisition and the conduct of the business of GIFA Holding, Limited. In all of these matters we cannot assure you that we will be successful in implementing any business plans or strategies that will allow us to achieve any improvement or increase in our sales revenues, cash flow, or profitability or if we do achieve any such improvement or increase, that we can maintain that improvement or increase in the future.  We are subject to many risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the risks associated with acquiring a new business and the risks of operating a small business.
 
 Employees
 
During the 2016 fiscal year ending March 31, 2016 we had no other employees other than our sole officer and director, Harshawardhan Shetty. Historically, we have relied on skilled consultants and third party work. Until we complete the planned Divestiture, we intend to expand our current management to retain skilled directors, officers, and employees with experience relevant to our business focus. We may also hire an in-house software development team.
