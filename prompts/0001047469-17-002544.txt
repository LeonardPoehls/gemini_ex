     Item 1.    Business 
  Overview 
         The Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, was founded in 1898 and is one of the largest regional department store operators in the United States, offering a broad assortment of brand-name fashion apparel and accessories for women, men and children. Our merchandise offerings also include cosmetics, home furnishings and other goods. We currently operate 262 stores in 25 states in the Northeast, Midwest and upper Great Plains under the Bon-Ton, Bergner's, Boston Store, Carson's, Elder-Beerman, Herberger's and Younkers nameplates, encompassing a total of approximately 24 million square feet. 
 Industry Overview 
         We compete in the department store segment of the U.S. retail industry, a highly competitive environment. The department store industry continues to evolve in response to competitive retail formatsmass merchandisers, national chain retailers, specialty retailers and online retailersand the expansion of mobile technology and social media. 
         Our operating results and performance, and that of our competitors, depend significantly on economic conditions and their impact on consumer spending. Presently, there are numerous business and economic factors affecting the retail industry, including the department store sector. These factors include underemployment and the low labor participation rate, fluctuating consumer confidence, consumer buying habits and slow growth in the U.S. economy and around the globe. 
   Merchandise 
   Merchandise Assortment 
         Our stores offer a broad assortment of quality fashion apparel and accessories for women, men and children, as well as cosmetics, home furnishings and other goods at moderate and better price points. Our comprehensive merchandise assortment includes nationally distributed brands at competitive prices and unique products at compelling values through our private brands. We further

  differentiate our merchandise assortment with exclusive products from nationally distributed brands. The following table illustrates our percent of net sales by product category for the last three years:

  Nationally Distributed Brands 
         Our nationally distributed brand assortment includes many of the most well-known and popular labels in the apparel, accessories, footwear, cosmetics and home furnishings industries such as Anne Klein, Calvin Klein, Carters, Chaps, Clarks, Clinique, Coach, Estée Lauder, Fossil, Free People, Frye, Jessica Simpson, Kenneth Cole, Keurig, Lancôme, Lauren, Levi's, Michael Kors, Nine West, Polo, Sperry, Steve Madden, UGG, Under Armour and Vince Camuto. We believe these, and other, brands enable us to position our stores as headquarters for fashion, offering both newness and wardrobe staples at competitive prices. We believe we maintain excellent relationships with our merchandise vendors, working collaboratively to select the most compelling assortments for our customers. 
 Private Brands 
         Our exclusive private brands complement our offerings of nationally distributed brands and are a key component of our overall merchandising strategy. Our private brand portfolio includes popular brands such as Laura Ashley, Ruff Hewn, Relativity, Studio Works, Breckenridge, Exertek, Living Quarters, Paradise Collections, Le Tigre, Cuddle Bear, John Bartlett and Casa by Victor Alfaro. 
         By providing exclusive fashion products at price points that are more attractive than nationally distributed brand alternatives, our private brand program creates value for our customers and increases our brand exclusiveness, competitive differentiation and customer loyalty. Our private brand program also presents the opportunity to increase our overall gross margin by virtue of the more efficient cost structure inherent in the design and sourcing of in-house brands. 
   Vendor Relationships and Sourcing 
         Our highly experienced team of buyers has developed long-standing and strong relationships with many of the leading vendors in the marketplace. Our scale, geographic footprint and market position make us an important distribution channel for leading merchandise vendors to reach their target consumers. We believe our status as a key account to many of our vendors serves to strengthen our ability to negotiate for merchandise exclusive to our stores as well as favorable pricing terms. We monitor and evaluate the sales and profitability of each vendor and adjust our purchasing decisions based upon the results of this analysis. 
         Consistent with industry practice, we receive allowances from some of our vendors in support of the merchandise sold to us that was marked down or otherwise did not allow us to achieve certain 
 2

  margins when sold to our customers. Additionally, we receive advertising allowances and reimbursement of certain payroll expenses from some of our vendors, which primarily represent reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote and sell the vendors' merchandise. 
   Marketing and Customer Service 
         We are committed to providing our customers with a satisfying shopping experience by offering trend-right fashions, differentiated product, value and convenience. Critical elements of our customer service approach are:


 omnichannel marketing programs designed to promote customer awareness of our fashion, quality and value; 
 customer targeting strategies that foster and strengthen long-term relationships; 
 frequent shopper promotions for our private label credit card holders; and 
 knowledgeable, friendly and well-trained sales associates. 

 Marketing 
         Our strategic marketing initiatives develop and enhance our brand equity and support our position as a leading shopping destination among our target customers. Our multi-faceted marketing program is designed to engage our customers through multiple media channels and allows us to attract new customers and to maintain loyalty with our existing customer base. We are focused on enhancing our media mix strategy to optimize media channel allocations and maximize our return on investment. We will continue to adjust our media mix, leveraging traditional print media as well as broadcast and digital media to support our multi-channel marketing programs. We are expanding our use of highly targeted digital media as well as increasing our investments in social media platforms. We will continue to enhance our efforts with regard to localizing content as well as implementing personalization strategies for email and direct marketing to further increase the relevancy of our marketing messages for individual customers. 
         We use a combination of (1) advertising and sales promotion activities to build brand image and increase customer traffic and (2) customer-specific communications and purchase incentives to drive customer spending and loyalty. Both types of marketing efforts focus primarily on our target customer, women between the ages of 25 and 60 with average annual household income of $55,000 to $125,000, with the intention of increasing visit frequency and purchases per visit. Our marketing activities also seek to attract a broader audience. We seek to attract new customers and to maintain our customer loyalty by actively communicating with our customers through the execution of targeted marketing facilitated by sophisticated customer relationship management capabilities. 
         We are focused on important charitable causes and events to enhance our connection with the communities in which we operate and with the customers we serve. These strategic initiatives garner favorable publicity, increase customer traffic and generate incremental sales. Additionally, these efforts serve to differentiate us from our competitors. 
         We maintain an active calendar of in-store events to promote our merchandise and sales efforts. These events include designer appearances, fashion shows and national makeup artist events. 
   Private Label Credit Card 
         Evidencing our customer satisfaction and loyalty is the high penetration rate of our private label credit card program. We have approximately 3.8 million active private label credit card holders. Our 
 3

  private label credit card program is administered by Comenity Bank, a subsidiary of Alliance Data Systems Corporation ("ADS"). 
         Our private label credit card loyalty program is designed to cultivate long-term relationships with our customers by offering rewards and privileges to all members, including advanced sales notices, savings and events. The program is designed to promote increased visits to our stores and shopping across multiple departments within our stores. 
   Customer Service 
         We maintain a sales force of knowledgeable and well-trained sales associates to deliver excellent service to our customers. Sales associates are trained in the areas of customer service, selling skills and product knowledge. Our new associates receive computer-based training to deliver an effective, efficient and uniform training experience. In 2017, we will continue to conduct "Customer First" training for all newly-hired associates, a program designed to increase engagement with our customers on the selling floor, and use point-of-sale ("POS") modules as training tools for selling skills, product knowledge and trend updates for our sales associates. We view customer service as a key element of our growth strategy and have identified opportunities to enhance service and deliver meaningful results. To that end, we implemented a training program for our store personnel with a focus on the customer service aspects of our "Let Us Find It" software that provides customer-friendly access to 100% of the Company's available inventory. 
         We employ a two-tiered strategy to achieve effective customer service. First, in selected areas, we offer one-on-one selling with dedicated associates to assist customers with merchandise selections. Second, we offer the convenience of self-service formats in many departments and efficient service centers to expedite customer purchases. We actively monitor and analyze, through our scheduling program, the service levels in our stores in order to maximize sales associate productivity and store profitability. 
         We believe that customers are responding favorably to retailers that make it convenient for them to shop on their terms. Our customer order management system, established a solid foundation to support omnichannel sales growth. Our successful "Let Us Find It" program allows our selling associates to use search capabilities to help customers find a brand, size, or color currently not available at a store location, or from our extensive omnichannel assortment for delivery directly to their homes. We expanded our store order fulfillment locations, which provided the ability to better serve our customers by directing omnichannel orders to store locations for fulfillment. Our service strategy is reinforced through the use of technology to foster customer interaction, affording us an opportunity to enhance our brand and broaden our appeal to younger customers. In the fall of 2016, we updated our omnichannel capabilities with new mobile commerce capabilities and to offer our customers the option to "Buy Online Pick Up In-Store" in all locations, adding an additional convenience service. We will continue exploring ways to use new tools and capabilities to make our sales floor more responsive to our customer. 
   Competition 
         The retail industry is highly competitive. We face competition for customers from traditional department store operators such as Boscov's Department Store LLC, Dillard's, Inc., Macy's, Inc. and Von Maur Inc.; national chain retailers such as J.C. Penney Company, Inc., Kohl's Corporation and Sears Holdings Corporation; mass merchandisers such as Target Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.; online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc.; specialty stores; off-price retailers; and catalogue retailers. In a number of our markets, we compete for customers with national department store chains which offer a similar mix of branded merchandise as we do. In other markets, we face potential competition from national chains that, to date, have not entered such markets and from national chains that have stores 
 4

  in our markets but currently do not carry similar branded goods. In all markets, we generally compete for customers with stores offering moderately-priced goods. In addition, we face competition for suitable store locations from other department stores, national chain retailers, mass merchandisers and other large-format retailers. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do, and many of those competitors have significantly less debt than we do and may thus have greater flexibility to respond to changes in our industry. 
         Success in these competitive marketplaces is based on factors such as price, product assortment and quality, service and convenience. We believe that we compare favorably with our competitors with respect to quality of product, depth and breadth of merchandise, prices for comparable quality merchandise, customer service and store environment. We also believe our knowledge of and focus on small to mid-size markets, developed over our many years of operation, give us an advantage in these markets that cannot be readily duplicated. In markets in which we face traditional department store competition, we believe that we compete effectively. 
   Trademarks and Trade Names 
         We own or license various trademarks and trade names, including our store nameplates and private brands. We believe our trademarks and trade names are important and that the loss of certain of our trademarks or trade names, particularly our store nameplates, could have a material adverse effect on us. We are not aware of any claims of infringement or other challenges to our right to use our trademarks in the United States that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
 Information Technology and Systems 
         Our information technology initiatives are focused on (1) continuing the strong growth of our omnichannel business and enabling new growth initiatives, (2) updating systems and business processes with emphasis on enhancing our customers' shopping experience through all channels, (3) strengthening our cybersecurity programs to protect customer, employee, and corporate data, (4) applying advanced analytic techniques in merchant reporting systems to quickly identify sales, margin, merchandise assortment and inventory management opportunities, (5) updating our merchandising and planning systems in support of localization initiatives, (6) improving associate productivity and consistency of process execution and (7) reducing operating costs. 
         During 2016, investments in technology infrastructure equipment and software were focused on omnichannel selling systems and operating efficiencies to drive down costs. Our omnichannel sites were updated, including the implementation of new advanced search and navigation capabilities to improve key word accuracy and prioritization, and to permit new product presentation options designed to improve relevancy and conversion. Our mobile site was upgraded to support new mobile applications for our customers and associates. The site is designed and developed using responsive technologies to synchronize mobile functionality with our primary sites in order to deliver a similar experience to our customers regardless of how they access our omnichannel sites. A new mobile application was delivered to our customers to strengthen our capabilities to support this fast growing customer engagement touchpoint. The application delivers promotions directly to customers' mobile devices, provides access to our Your Rewards loyalty program, includes a barcode scanner and more. Customers can simply scan merchandise and be directed to our omnichannel sites to find more colors and sizes, or access our full online assortment anytime they want to shop. 
         Another major improvement in our omnichannel capabilities is the introduction of "Buy Online Pick Up In-Store" enabling the convenience of online ordering, and the option to pick up merchandise at a nearby store. Along with improvements at our new West Jefferson fulfillment center, we expanded our store order fulfillment locations, and invested in advanced order sourcing capabilities to better 
 5

  utilize store inventory and manage order shipping costs. A new loyalty programLove Style Rewardswas introduced for our customers who prefer to use payment methods other than our private label credit card. Our new merchandise sample management system was expanded to integrate with automated item set up processes to further reduce the time between receipt of new merchandise and its availability to sell on omnichannel sites and through in store selling tools. 
         We completed our implementation of point to point encryption of card data, card number tokenization and Europay, MasterCard, Visa (EMV) "chip card" technologies, substantially reducing the risks associated with credit card processing. "Guest Networks" are available in all locations where broadband service is available providing our customers Wi-Fi access. Through the use of broadband communications technologies, we have significantly increased our network and cellular capacities, and retained the existing network capability, all focused on improving our customers' experience and our associates' capabilities to serve our customers in a digital marketplace. The new network infrastructure continues to provide lower operating costs. Inventory management programs utilizing radio frequency identification technologies continue to provide value through improved accuracy of footwear and luggage display samples to ensure stock room inventory is always represented on the selling floor. 
         In 2017, we will continue business process improvements to improve our customers' shopping experience in store and online. Our focus will remain on improving our omnichannel capabilities, adding new mobile application capabilities and improving operating efficiency. 
   Inventory Management 
         Our merchandising function is centralized, with a staff of buyers and a planning and allocation team who have responsibility for determining the merchandise assortment, quantities to be purchased and allocation of merchandise to each store. In order to support our localization initiative, our centralized staff includes regional store planners, who have responsibilities of communicating merchandise opportunities and developing specialized assortments by store through analytical review of store data, frequent on-site visits and local competitive assessments. 
         We primarily operate using a pre-distribution model through which we allocate merchandise on our initial purchase orders to each store. This merchandise is shipped from our vendors to our distribution facilities for delivery to designated stores. We have the ability to direct replenishment merchandise to the stores that demonstrate the highest customer demand. This reactive distribution technique helps minimize excess inventory and affords us timely and accurate replenishment. 
         We utilize electronic data interchange (EDI) technology with most vendors, which is designed to move merchandise onto the selling floor quickly and cost-effectively by allowing vendors to deliver merchandise pre-labeled for individual store locations. In addition, we utilize high-speed automated conveyor systems in our distribution facilities to scan bar coded labels on incoming cartons of merchandise and direct cartons to the proper processing areas. Most of our merchandise is unloaded in the receiving area and immediately "cross-docked" to the shipping dock for delivery to the stores. Certain processing areas are staffed with personnel equipped with hand-held radio frequency devices that can scan a vendor's bar code and transmit the necessary information to a computer to record merchandise on hand. We utilize third-party carriers to distribute our merchandise to our stores. 
         The majority of our merchandise is held in our stores. We closely monitor inventory levels and assortments in our stores to facilitate reorder and replenishment decisions, satisfy customer demand and maximize sales. Our business follows a seasonal pattern; merchandise inventories fluctuate with seasonal variations, reaching their highest level in October or November in advance of the holiday season. 
         In addition to inventories to support our store operations, we maintain inventories to support our growing online business. These inventories are administered through similar procurement methods and 
 6

  are staged in our fulfillment center to complete customer orders received from our omnichannel sites and customer orders taken at POS modules in our store locations. We lease an approximately 743,000 square foot highly automated direct-to-consumer fulfillment center to support our growing omnichannel operations. This fulfillment center became fully operational in the fall of 2015. We consolidated our omnichannel fulfillment activity at this site which has significantly expanded our shipping capacity with improved operational efficiency. 
         We have a customer return policy allowing customers to return merchandise, for which a reserve is provided in our consolidated statements of operations for estimated returns. The reserve is based on historical returns experience, and is reflected as an adjustment to sales and costs of merchandise sold. 
   Seasonality 
         Our business, like that of most retailers, is subject to seasonal fluctuations, with the major portion of sales and income realized during the second half of each year, which includes the holiday season. Due to the fixed nature of certain costs, our selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses are typically higher as a percentage of net sales during the first half of each year. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full year. In addition, quarterly results of operations depend upon the timing and amount of revenues and costs associated with the opening, closing and remodeling of existing stores. 
 Capital Investments 
         We make capital investments to support our long-term business goals and objectives. We invest capital in new and existing stores, distribution and support facilities and information technology. 
         We anticipate our 2017 capital expenditures will not exceed $41.9 million (excluding external contributions, primarily leasehold improvement and fixture allowances received from landlords or vendors, of $11.9 million, reducing budgeted net capital investments to $30.0 million). Projects include ongoing store remodels, information technology and store improvements. We believe these investments will drive growth and profitable returns. 
         We believe capital investments for information technology are necessary to support our business strategies. We are continually upgrading our information systems to improve efficiency and productivity. Included in the 2017 capital budget are expenditures for numerous information technology projects, most notably efforts to enhance our online presence and omnichannel capabilities, selling tools, merchant reporting and security measures. 
   Associates 
         As of March 24, 2017, we had approximately 23,300 full-time and part-time associates. We employ additional part-time associates during peak selling periods. We believe that our relationship with our associates is good.
