Company Overview 

         Boingo helps the world stay connected to the people and things they love. 
         We acquire long-term wireless rights at large venues like airports, transportation hubs, stadiums, arenas, military bases, universities, convention centers, and office campuses; build high-quality wireless networks such as distributed antenna systems ("DAS"), Wi-Fi, and small cells at those venues; and monetize the wireless networks through a number of products and services. 
         Over the past 16 years, we've built a global network of wireless networks that we estimate reaches more than a billion consumers annually. We operate 38 DAS networks containing approximately 23,500 DAS nodes, and believe we are the largest operator of indoor DAS networks in the world. Our Wi-Fi network, which includes locations we manage and operate ourselves (our "managed and operated locations") as well as networks managed and operated by third-parties with whom we contract for access (our "roaming" networks), includes approximately 1.5 million commercial Wi-Fi hotspots in more than 100 countries around the world. We also operate Wi-Fi and internet protocol television ("IPTV") networks at 62 U.S. Army, Air Force, and Marines bases around the world.

           We generate revenue from our wireless networks in a number of ways, including our DAS, small cells and wholesale Wi-Fi offerings, which are targeted towards businesses, and our military, retail, and advertising offerings, which are targeted towards consumers. 
         We generate wholesale revenue from telecom operators that pay us build-out fees and recurring access fees so that their cellular customers may use our DAS or small cell networks at locations where we manage and operate the wireless network. In 2017, DAS revenue accounted for approximately 39% of our revenue. 
         Military revenue, which is driven by military personnel who purchase broadband and IPTV services on military bases accounted for approximately 27% of our total revenue in 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we have grown our military subscriber base to approximately 130,000, an increase of approximately 22% over the prior year. Retail revenue, which is driven by consumers who purchase a recurring monthly subscription plan or one-time Wi-Fi access, accounted for approximately 12% of our total revenue in 2017. As of December 31, 2017, our retail subscriber base was approximately 188,000, a decrease of approximately 4% over the prior year. 
         Our enterprise customers such as telecom operators, cable companies, technology companies, and enterprise software/services companies, pay us usage-based Wi-Fi network access and software licensing fees to allow their customers' access to our footprint worldwide. Wholesale Wi-Fi revenue also includes financial institutions and other enterprise customers who provide Boingo as a value-added service for their customers. In 2017, wholesale Wi-Fi revenue accounted for approximately 16% of our revenue. 
         We also generate revenue from advertisers that seek to reach consumers via sponsored Wi-Fi access. In 2017, advertising and other revenue accounted for approximately 6% of our revenue. 
         Our customer agreements for certain DAS networks include both a fixed and variable fee structure with the highest percentage of sales typically occurring in the fourth quarter of each year and the lowest percentage of sales occurring in the first quarter of each year. We expect this trend to continue. Our other products have not experienced any significant seasonal impact. 
         We were incorporated in the State of Delaware in April 2001 under the name Project Mammoth, Inc. and changed our name to Boingo Wireless, Inc. in October 2001. Our principal executive offices are located in Los Angeles, California. Our website address is www.boingo.com. The information on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 


Industry Overview 

         Today, consumers own multiple connected devicessmartphones, laptops, tablets, wearables, and more. According to Cisco's 2017 Visual Networking Index ("CVNI"), global mobile data traffic grew 63% in 2016 and mobile data traffic has grown eighteen-fold over the past 5 years. CVNI estimates that by 2021, there will be 1.5 mobile devices for every human on the planet. That means 11.6 billion connected mobile devices for an estimated 7.8 billion people. 
         What's more, mobile data growth is explodingdriven by the mix and growth of wireless devices that are accessing mobile networks worldwide and the increase in high-bandwidth activities like video, online gaming, streaming, cloud-based applications and mobile apps. In fact, CVNI estimates that global mobile traffic will grow seven-fold from 2016 to 2021, with video accounting for 78% of the world's mobile traffic by 2021. CVNI further estimates that typical smartphones will churn out 6.8 gigabytes of traffic monthly by 2021, up four times from the average of 1.6 gigabytes per month they do now. Per CVNI, in 2016, 63% of all traffic from connected mobile devices will be offloaded to the fixed network by means of Wi-Fi devices and femtocells each month, and by 2021, of all IP traffic (fixed and mobile), 50% will be Wi-Fi, 30% will be wired, and 20% will be mobile. Per CVNI, mobile network

   connection speeds grew more than three-fold in 2016 from a downstream speed of 2.0 Megabits per second ("Mbps") in 2015 to 6.8 Mbps in 2016. 
         The mobile data explosion has fueled the growth of higher-generation network connectivity to address the demand for more bandwidth, higher security, and faster connectivity. Telecom operators have started trials for 5G, which will provide higher bandwidth (greater than 1 gigabit per second), broader coverage, and ultra-low latency. Significant 5G deployments are expected by 2020 subject to certain gating factors like standards development, regulatory approval, and spectrum availability. 
 


Challenges Facing Our Industry 

         The mobile Internet is a complex and constantly evolving ecosystem comprised of dozens of manufacturers and many different operating systems. This complexity is amplified as new device models and operating systems are released, new categories of devices become Internet enabled, and new network technologies emerge. 
         To cope with the significant increase in mobile Internet data traffic, wireless network operators must: build denser networks, closer to the end consumer; explore solutions to offload network traffic from congested, licensed spectrum onto more efficient unlicensed spectrum; and invest in technologies that will enable the convergence of licensed and unlicensed spectrum. We expect our wireless networks to play a significant role in helping meet the ever-increasing data demands of connected consumers. 
 


Our Strategy 

         We believe we are the leading global provider of neutral-host commercial mobile Wi-Fi Internet solutions and indoor DAS services. Our overall business strategy is simple: acquire long-term wireless rights at large venues; build high-quality wireless networks at those venues; and monetize the wireless networks through a number of products and services. In support of our overall business strategy, we are focused on the following objectives: 
 

 Expand our footprint of managed and operated and aggregated networks.  We
intend to continue to grow our global network of managed and operated DAS, Wi-Fi and small cell networks. We focus our venue acquisition strategy on locations with a common profilelarge
venues with significant population densityas these venues face challenges that we are uniquely qualified to solve. We also plan to enter into new roaming agreements with hotspot operators
to maximize the reach of our aggregated network, which creates a more attractive offering for our wholesale enterprise, military and retail customers. 
 Leverage our neutral-host business model to grow DAS, small cell, and wholesale roaming
partnerships.  Our neutral-host model enables us to effectively partner with venues because we ensure all customers receive high-quality wireless service. We
successfully balance the interests of individual carriers with the goals of our venue partners,
and build flexible DAS network architectures that can support multiple carriers and the latest mobile services. We are also beginning to deploy small cell networks, and we believe this technology will
enable us to expand into certain venues where a traditional DAS network is cost-prohibitive. 
 Expand our carrier offload relationships.  As cellular networks become
strained due to capacity, carriers are beginning to offload their licensed mobile traffic onto unlicensed spectrum. We are highly focused on partnering with all four Tier 1 carriers in the U.S.
as well as other carriers around the world to offload their mobile traffic onto our Wi-Fi networks. 
 Maximize our military business through recurring subscriber fees and shorter-term transaction plans, as well as strategic
build-outs.  Our military business is uniquely designed for the highly mobile young men and women of the U.S. Army, Air Force and Marines who are
frequently deployed from base to base. Our service is portable from base to base, requires no equipment, installation

appointment
or truck roll, enabling a user to sign up and receive service immediately. We believe this currently provides a significant competitive advantage over the other providers who may also be
operating on that base. We will continue to evaluate new military build-outs beyond our current footprint. 


 Increase our brand awareness.  We will continue to seek new ways to promote
our brand through our managed and operated hotspots. We intend to enhance our brand through low-cost co-marketing arrangements with our partners and through periodic promotional and sponsorship
activities and by continuing to leverage the reach of social media and public relations to interact with our customers. 




Services 

         Our solution makes it easy, convenient and cost effective for consumers to access the mobile Internet. 
         DAS or Small Cell.    We offer our telecom operator partners access to our DAS or small cell networks at our managed and operated locations. We deploy our DAS or small cell networks within venues that require additional signal strength to improve the quality of cellular services. 
  Military.    We provide high-speed Wi-Fi and IPTV services for military servicemen and women living in the barracks of U.S. Army, Air Force and Marine bases around the world. We offer a selection of recurring monthly subscriptions and shorter-term transactional plans. We currently offer two tiers of service: Standard Internet (5 Mbps) and Expanded Internet (30 Mbps) as well as IPTV service. Our military service plans are portable from base to base and require no equipment or installation, enabling a user to sign up and receive service immediately. 
  WholesaleWi-Fi.    Our integrated hardware and software platform allows us to provide a range of enhanced services to network operators, device manufacturers, technology companies, enterprise software and services companies, venue operators and financial services companies. 
 

 Carrier offload services.  We offer services to carriers to move traffic
from their licensed cellular networks onto our Wi-Fi networks. 
 Comes With Boingo.  We offer access to our entire network of approximately
1.5 million hotspot locations to financial institutions and other enterprise customers who then offer them as a loyalty incentive to their customers. 
 Wi-Fi roaming and software services.  We offer roaming services across our
entire network of approximately 1.5 million hotspot locations to our partners who can then provide mobile Internet services to their customers at these locations. Our software solution, which
provides one-click access to our global footprint of hotspots, has been rebranded for wholesale partners, in addition to being marketed under the Boingo brand. In combination with our back-end system
infrastructure, it creates a global roaming solution for operators, carriers, other service providers and other businesses. 
 Turn-key solutions.  We offer our venue partners the ability to implement a
turn-key Wi-Fi solution through a Wi-Fi network infrastructure that we install, manage and operate. Our turn-key solutions include a variety of service models that are supported through a mix of
wholesale Wi-Fi, military, retail, and advertising revenue. 

  Retail.    We enable individuals to purchase Internet access at our managed and operated hotspots and select partner locations around the world. We offer a selection of recurring monthly subscriptions and single-use access plans. Our most common plans are the $9.95 monthly subscription for up to four connected devices, and the single-use Boingo AsYouGo at $7.95 per day or $4.95 per hour. Our 
 5

   single-use access plans provide unlimited access on a single device at a specific hotspot for a defined period of time, tolled from the time the user first logs on to the network. We will continue to launch other flexible plans to meet the evolving needs of our customers and venues. 
  Advertising.    Our Wi-Fi platform provides a valuable opportunity for advertisers to reach consumers with sponsored Wi-Fi access, promotional programs and display advertising. We provide brands and advertisers the opportunity to sponsor wireless connectivity to individuals at locations where we manage and operate the Wi-Fi network and locations where we solely provide authorized access to a partner's Wi-Fi network through sponsored access and promotional programs. Our advertising solution is easily integrated into Wi-Fi networks not directly managed by Boingo. 
 


Our Network 

         Over the past 16 years, we've built a global network of wireless networks that we estimate reaches more than a billion consumers annually. We operate 38 DAS networks containing 23,500 DAS nodes, and believe we are the largest operator of indoor DAS networks in the world. Our Wi-Fi networkwhich includes our managed and operated locations and our roaming networksincludes approximately 1.5 million commercial Wi-Fi hotspots in more than 100 countries around the world.

Marketing and Business Development 

         Our marketing and business development efforts are designed to cost effectively expand our footprint of venues where we can deploy DAS, Wi-Fi and small cell networks, secure more carrier contracts, attract and retain new military and retail customers, and identify business partners that could leverage our network to provide mobile Internet services to their customers. We focus on efficient customer acquisition through our online presence, social media, public relations, influencer marketing, experiential and event marketing, market research, and other promotional activities. 
         We seek to maximize customer lifetime value by managing subscriber acquisition cost, extending customer life and determining appropriate pricing. We use information about subscriber behavior to help us retain customers and determine premium offerings. Our segmentation is focused at the product level, so that we provide the right product, plan and price for our military and retail customers. Our consumer plans are available for essentially all Wi-Fi enabled devices and are priced on a month-to-month or per-use basis. 
         We issue regular press releases announcing important partnerships and product developments and continually update our website with information about our network and services. We leverage our social media accounts, website and blog to further promote Boingo's product availability and applicability for 
 6

   military men and women, travelers, digital elite and consumers on-the-go. Our executive team speaks at industry events, trade shows and conferences. 
 


Development 

         Our development efforts are focused primarily on supporting our networks and the businesses that run across these networks. These efforts include developing web applications for ease of connecting to our managed and operated locations and aggregate partner networks, integrating our software client with our wholesale partners, continuing to adapt our technology to new operating systems and platforms, continuing to develop an advertising system and business and operations support system for monetizing network service, continuing to develop an IPTV platform for delivering IPTV services to our military bases and optimizing our networks and backend systems for roaming and carrier offload. Our development model is based on Agile development practices so any deviations can be promptly corrected to improve reliability in our network or services and enhance customer satisfaction. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, development and technology expenses were $26.8 million, $22.1 million and $19.1 million, respectively. 
 


Technology 

         Over the past 16 years, we have developed proprietary systems that include the Boingo software client and software development kit ("SDK"); authentication, authorization and tracking systems; mediation and billing systems; IPTV management and delivery platform; free user monetization media and advertising platform; and a real-time operational support and software configuration and messaging infrastructure. 
 


Boingo Software Client and SDK 

         The Boingo software client and SDK are installed on Wi-Fi enabled devices such as smartphones, laptops and tablets to enable our customers and our partners' customers to access our network. The key features of the Boingo software client include: 
 

 Simple user interface.  The Boingo software client provides individuals with
an uncomplicated, user-friendly interface designed to streamline the Wi-Fi network connection process. The software finds hotspots and monitors the availability of Wi-Fi hotspots in the Boingo
network, presents a notification message of the hotspot identified and allows one-click user connections. In some devices, connection to a Boingo Wi-Fi hotspot occurs in the background, providing the
user with a seamless, notification-free connectivity experience. 
 Support for all major operating system platforms.  The Boingo software
client and SDK support the Android, iOS, Mac OS and Windows operating systems, which represents the majority of all devices connecting to our managed and operated venues. 
 Automatic updates.  The Boingo software client automatically receives
identification information for new hotspot locations as they are added to the Boingo network, including any information needed to automatically identify and login to the network. Location information,
allowing a user to find Boingo hotspots from the client, is also automatically updated. On all but embedded platforms, software updates are also automatically offered to a user when available. 
 Custom branding and flexible integration alternatives.  We offer wholesale
customers the ability to integrate the Boingo software client into their products and services as a SDK. Additionally, we offer wholesale customers the option to utilize a custom, rebranded reference
design of the software client used in our retail customer offering.

Authentication, Authorization and Tracking System 

         Our proprietary authentication, authorization and tracking system enables the reliable, scalable and secure initiation and termination of user Wi-Fi sessions on our network. This system authenticates our network users across a wide variety of hotspots and network operators, through a normalized authentication protocol. Through the authorization process, custom business rules ensure user access based on specific service parameters such as location, type of device, service plan and account information. Our system also captures duration, data traffic, location, and type of device. We normalize and process this data from disparate providers for our use and for our wholesale partners. This system has been enhanced to include support for secure Next Generation Hotspot roaming, which leverages Passpoint-certified devices and network hardware to establish seamless secure connections for customers. 
 


Mediation and Billing System 

         Our mediation and billing system records and analyzes individual usage sessions required to bill for Wi-Fi usage. Users are charged based on variables such as pricing plan, device type, location, time and amount of use. Our system consolidates usage session information, determines the user identity and applies the appropriate aggregation and flagging to ensure proper usage processing. Our system handles exceptions automatically. Exceptions that cannot be solved automatically are brought to the attention of the operations staff for rectification of any discrepancies. The billing system provides billing based on roaming relationship, user type, device type and account type. Our military and retail customer mediation and billing is handled by the same infrastructure used for wholesale customer and billing, resulting in efficiencies of scale and operation. 
 


IPTV Management and Delivery Platform 

         Our IPTV system enables us to deliver content to our military subscribers. The Boingo digital rights management ("DRM") system allows for live linear commercial content to be delivered securely through our encrypted network links that connect our primary IPTV data center and the military bases. The IPTV central content management system allows for regional content delivery and multiple programming bundle offers. To enhance the viewing experience for mobile and tablet devices, the Boingo IPTV delivery system uses HTTP Live Streaming distribution protocol that will accommodate playing content at different network speeds by dynamically reducing content size. 
 


Free User Monetization Media and Advertising Platform 

         The Boingo Media platform enables brand advertisers to reach a captive audience through high engagement Wi-Fi sponsorships in premium locations worldwide. It delivers engaging advertising experiences, and our partners can place their messaging in the right context to their target audience. It also allows a combination of branding with direct response in a single high-impact format. Frequent travelers can be reached in a way they appreciateby receiving free Wi-Fi access when they need it most. 
 


Software Configuration and Messaging System 

         Our software configuration system provides real-time network configuration updates for thousands of networks and over 20 detection and login methodologies used by the Boingo software client to access our network. Our software configuration system automatically registers new network definitions and login methodologies to allow individuals to connect to our hotspot locations. All supported platforms use a single configuration, providing a high level of operational and test efficiency. Our messaging system enables real-time customer notification and system interaction at login, based on 
 8

   location, network, user, account type, device and usage. This approach enables us and our partners to deliver custom marketing or service messages. 
 


Operations 

         We provide significant operational support for our managed and operated wireless infrastructure and the related technical systems in our network. For our managed and operated networks, we design, build, monitor and maintain the network. For roaming partners, we monitor network and related system uptime and report issues so that they can be quickly remedied. We have service level agreements with our roaming partners specifying minimum network uptime requirements and specified quality of service levels for different services that run across the wireless network infrastructure. 
         Our Wi-Fi deployments are based on the IEEE 802.11a, b, g, n and ac standards and operate in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz unlicensed spectrum bands. We design, build, and operate DAS and small cell networks that provide 2G, 3G, and 4G-LTE services across multiple licensed-frequency bands for all major telecom operators. 
 


Customers 

         We generate revenue primarily from our wholesale partners (including DAS customers) and military and retail customers. Our DAS customers are telecom operators who pay us one-time build-out fees and recurring access fees for our DAS network, enabling their cellular customers to access these networks. Our wholesale Wi-Fi customers pay usage-based network access fees to allow their customers access to our global Wi-Fi network and other wholesale Wi-Fi partners pay us to provide Wi-Fi services in their venue locations under a service provider arrangement. Our wholesale customer relationships are generally governed by multi-year contracts. We acquire our wholesale customers through our business development efforts. Our military and retail customers either purchase month-to-month subscription plans that automatically renew, or single-use access to our network. We acquire our military and retail customers primarily from users passing through our managed and operated locations, where we generally have exclusive multi-year agreements. We also generate revenue from advertisers that seek to reach visitors seeking Wi-Fi access at our managed and operated network locations with online advertising, promotional and sponsored programs. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, entities affiliated with AT&T Inc. accounted for 11%, 12% and 17%, respectively, of total revenue. For each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, entities affiliated with Sprint Corporation accounted for 11% of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2017, entities affiliated with Verizon Communications Inc. accounted for 11% of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2017, entities affiliated with T-Mobile USA, Inc. accounted for 11% of total revenue. The loss of these groups and the customers could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations. 
 


Key Business Metrics 

         In addition to monitoring traditional financial measures, we also monitor our operating performance using key performance indicators. Our key performance indicators follow: 

   
 | Year Ended December 31, | 
 | 2017 | | 2016 | 2015 
 | (in thousands) | 
DAS nodes | | 23.5 | | 19.2 | 10.9 
Subscribersmilitary | | 130 | | 107 | 57 
Subscribersretail | | 188 | | 195 | 204 
Connects | | 223,960 | | 142,802 | 105,335


9

    DAS nodes.    This metric represents the number of active DAS nodes as of the end of the period. A DAS node is a single communications endpoint, typically an antenna, which transmits or receives radio frequency signals wirelessly. This measure is an indicator of the reach of our DAS network. 
         Subscribersmilitary and  Subscribersretail.    These metrics represent the number of paying customers who are on a month-to-month subscription plan at a given period end. 
  Connects.    This metric shows how often individuals connect to our global Wi-Fi network in a given period. The connects include wholesale and retail customers in both customer pay locations and customer free locations where we are a paid service provider or receive sponsorship or promotion fees. We count each connect as a single connect regardless of how many times that individual accesses the network at a given venue during their 24 hour period. This measure is an indicator of paid activity throughout our network. 
 


Customer Support 

         We provide support services to our military, retail, and enterprise customers 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year. Support is available by phone, chat, email, or social media channels like Twitter and Facebook. Our website contains a comprehensive knowledge base that includes answers to frequently asked questions for self-help, and we provide video support on our YouTube channel. Tier 1 support is provided by a third-party provider, while Tier 2 and social media support is managed by our internal customer care team. 
 


Competition 

         The market for mobile Internet services and solutions is fragmented and competitive. We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry include the following:
 

 price; 
 quality of service; 
 venue exclusivity; 
 ease of access and use; 
 bundled service offerings; 
 geographic reach; and 
 brand name recognition. 

         Direct and indirect competitors include telecom operators, cable companies, self-managed venue networks and smaller wireless Internet service providers. Some of these competitors have substantially greater resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have. They may offer bundled data services with primary service offerings that we do not generally offer such as landline and cellular telephone service, and cable or satellite television. Many of our competitors are also partners from whom we receive revenue when their customers access our network. 
         We believe that we compete favorably based on our ability to deliver end-to-end solutions, our neutral host business model, brand recognition, geographic coverage, network reliability, quality of service, ease of use, and cost. 
 


Intellectual Property 

         Our ongoing success will depend in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual restrictions. 
 10

           We have nine issued U.S. patents, two of which expire in 2022, and the other seven of which expire between 2030 and 2035. We have two patent applications pending in the United States and one patent application pending in Europe. We have two issued Japanese patents and two issued Chinese patents, each of which has a maximum term that expires in 2027. 
         Our registered trademarks in the United States and the European Union include "Boingo", "Boingo Wi-Finder", and "Don't just go. Boingo.", and in the United States, "Boingo Broadband", "Cloudnine 9 Media", "Concourse Communications", and "AWG-WIFI". We own additional registrations and have filed other trademark applications in the United States and other countries. 
         In addition to the foregoing protections, we control access to, and use of, our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners. Our software is protected by United States and international copyright laws. 
 


Employees 

         As of December 31, 2017, we had 334 employees, including 131 in operations, 91 in development and technology, 69 in sales and marketing and 43 in general and administrative. All of our employees are full-time employees except for two part-time employees. We have seven international employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced any employment related work stoppages and consider relations with our employees to be good. As of December 31, 2017, we also had arrangements with a third-party call center provider that provided us with approximately 53 full-time equivalent contractors for military, retail and enterprise customer support service and similar functions.
