ITEM 1. Business 
OVERVIEW AND STRATEGY
At Vonage, we are redefining business communications. True to our roots as a technology disruptor, we are embracing technology to transform how businesses communicate to create better business outcomes. Our cloud communications platform enables businesses of all sizes to collaborate more productively and engage their customers more efficiently across any device. Vonage customers can choose among two separate delivery models to suit their specific communication needs: They can purchase Vonage Business with a Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, model for a complete and configured unified communications solution or they can purchase Nexmo, "the Vonage API Platform", with a Platform-as-a-Service, or PaaS, model and consume our cloud communication in programmable modules, delivered via application programming interfaces, or APIs. We also provide a robust suite of feature-rich residential communication solutions.
All of our cloud communications solutions are designed to allow businesses to be more productive by integrating communications with all their existing business productivity tools and our programmable solutions allow customers to engage with their customers via embedded voice, chat, or messaging to create seamless and contextual communications that makes doing business easier for end customers. The use cases for both within and between the SaaS and PaaS platforms continue to grow as businesses of all size continue to leverage cloud communications to improve employee productivity and customer experience. We also continue to provide a robust set of feature-rich residential communication solutions that allow consumers to connect their home phones and mobile phones on one number and we offer attractive international long distance rates that help create a loyal base of satisfied customers. 
Our business is organized under two reportable segments, Business and Consumer. Additional discussion of our reportable segments is included in Note 16, Industry Segment and Geographical Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Business 
Our strategy is to use cloud communications to deliver better business outcomes for our customers, leveraging our unique combination of cloud-based Unified Communications as a Service, or UCaaS, solutions and Communications Platform as a Service, or CPaaS, offerings. Our innovative UCaaS solution is comprised of integrated voice, text, video, data, collaboration, and mobile applications over our flexible, scalable Session Initiation Protocol, or SIP, based Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP, network. Our CPaaS, solutions are designed to enhance the way businesses communicate with their customers by embedding communications into apps, websites and business processes. In combination, our products and services permit our business customers to communicate with their customers and employees through any cloud-connected device, in any place, at any time without the costly investment required with on-site equipment. We have a robust set of product families tailored to serve the full range of the business value chain, from the small and medium business, or SMB, market, through mid-market and enterprise markets. We provide customers with multiple deployment options, designed to provide the reliability and quality of service they demand. We provide customers the ability to integrate our cloud communications platform with many cloud-based productivity and CRM solutions, including Google’s G Suite, Zendesk, Salesforce’s Sales Cloud, Oracle, and Clio. Additionally, we provide a variety of Contact Center as a Service, or CCaaS, offerings as customers continue to transform their contact and call centers with cloud communications. With our ability to integrate these cloud-based workplace tools, Vonage integrates the entire business communications value chain - from employee communications that maximize productivity to the direct engagement with customers that CPaaS provides. When combined with our Multiprotocol Label Switching, or MLPS, network, as well as voice services over customers' broadband networks via our SmartWan solution, we create a truly differentiated offering. 
We support the full range of business customers, using three product families: Vonage Business Cloud, formerly Vonage Essentials, based on our proprietary call processing platform that is purpose-built for SMB and mid-market customers; Vonage Enterprise, formerly Vonage Premier, based on Broadsoft’s call processing platform in combination with other Vonage cloud based solutions, which serves mid-market businesses and large enterprises; and Nexmo, the Vonage API platform which provides customers with the ability to integrate communications into their business applications. We believe operating our product platforms at scale enables us to deliver the right products and solutions to address the needs of diverse customers while maximizing our subscriber economics, regardless of segment served. Revenues are generated primarily through the sale of subscriptions for our UCaaS services and usage-based sales through our CPaaS services allowing our customers to address their full communication needs. Our revenue generation efforts are focused on customer acquisition and retention as well as providing additional services to existing customers as they grow and scale.

For our Consumer customers, we enable users to access and utilize our services and features, via a single “identity,” either a number or user name, regardless of how they are connected to the Internet, including over 3G/4G, LTE, Cable, or DSL broadband networks. This technology enables us to offer our Consumer customers attractively priced voice and messaging services and other features around the world on a variety of devices. 
Our Consumer marketing and distribution strategy is focused on the continued penetration of our core North American markets, where we will continue to provide value in international long distance and target under-served segments. The markets for international long distance allow us to leverage our VoIP network by providing customers a low-cost and feature-rich alternative to services offered by telecom, cable, and international calling card providers. 
We generate revenue through the acquisition and retention of Consumer customers. As part of our overall strategy, we are focused on optimizing the Consumer business for profitability to improve the strong cash flows of the business. During 2017, we continued our disciplined focus on marketing efficiency by shifting customer acquisition spend to our higher performing channels, improving the quality of customers we acquire and driving lower churn, all of which drive higher customer life-time value. This focus has led to a reallocation of marketing spend to our Business segment. 
The result of these initiatives has been to create a strong cash flow business which provides financial stability, as well as cost synergies and structural advantages to our Business segment.

Nexmo, The Vonage API Platform 
The communications industry is undergoing a major transformation from dedicated communications applications and devices to communications embedded in other applications and devices where the communications happens within the context of those applications. For example, when calling or messaging a taxi driver, consumers can do this within the taxi app which has all the necessary context such as the pickup location and payment method, resulting in a better experience for both parties. Similarly, when contacting a company consumers can communicate within the context of the company’s branded mobile app or website and agents within the context of their CRM desktop application, delivering a better experience for consumers and improving productivity for contact center agents. We call this type of communications “contextual” because it is context rich and delivers a better experience. This trend is enabled by a new category of cloud communications platforms that enable software developers to build communications capabilities such as messaging and voice calling within their applications without having to build or maintain communications infrastructure.
While innovative software companies were the early adopters of cloud communication platforms, over time virtually all companies will benefit from the new approach as part of their digital transformation journey. As more startups disrupt existing industries, established enterprises will innovate with communications APIs in order to more effectively compete with the new entrants and with their traditional competitors. Over time enterprises of all sizes will adopt contextual communications to deliver better business outcomes.

Nexmo, the Vonage API Platform, abstracts the complexities of the global communications networks and delivers voice, messaging, and authentication capabilities in the form of APIs that developers can easily embed into their applications with a low risk, pay as you go business model that fosters innovation. Developers adopt our APIs via a low friction, self service model on our website where they start with a free trial account and pay for additional usage with a credit card using prepaid accounts. Our customers include digital native companies who are looking to disrupt an existing industry, enterprises undergoing digital transformation, and enterprise SaaS companies looking to enhance their products with embedded communications capabilities. 
Our platform includes the following products:

• | Voice API: Our Voice API enables companies to deliver better and more flexible voice experiences when communicating with their customers within the context of their existing business workflow, backed by the quality, strength and reliability of the Vonage network in the United States and tier one carriers globally. 


• | SIP Trunking: Our SIP Trunking enables companies to rapidly connect their PBX to the global telecommunications networks using a pay as you go model and without having to negotiate lengthy carrier contracts. 


• | SMS API: Our SMS API enables companies to send and receive SMS messages within the context of their existing business workflows. Our direct to carrier approach and patented Adaptive Routing algorithm enables us to deliver messages reliably and with low latency, globally. 


• | Verify: Our Verify API enables companies to deploy two-factor-authentication for their applications to help them acquire genuine customers and to protect against fraud. With a single API call, Verify delivers messages via SMS and voice calls if required to ensure high conversion rates. In addition, customers pay only for successful authentications. 


• | Number Insight: Our Number Insight API enables companies to get real time intelligence on phone numbers anywhere in the world to ensure numbers are valid and reachable and to discover other insights such as carrier information, roaming status whether a landline or mobile, and caller name. 


• | Virtual Phone Numbers: We offer phone numbers that are local all over the world enabling our customers to have a local presence globally. We also offer toll free numbers and short codes in the United States and Canada. Our numbers can be provisioned and de-provisioned programmatically to enable maximum utilizations. 

Our product offerings combined with the strength of our network enable us to partner closely with our customers to ensure that they are successful through a personalized account management experience, high quality support and consulting services. The Company's CPaaS products are supported through our close relationships with tier one carriers across the globe and offer local numbers in more countries along with our private MPLS network with 21 points of presence in the United States allowing us to offer high voice quality, lower costs and increased reliability. Additionally, Nexmo has office locations all over the world, including the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Korea and China. Our extensive network of developers provides customers with the ability to foster rapid innovations, including extensive developer documentation, sample codes, tutorials, libraries and free online support.

Consumer 
Our home telephone services are offered to customers through several service plans with different pricing structures. The service plans include basic features such as voicemail, call waiting, and call forwarding as well as unique features such as Simulring, Visual Voicemail and Extensions. We also charge for local and international calling outside of plan limits. 
We have two primary Consumer offerings available in the United States: Vonage World and Vonage North America. For a flat monthly fee, Vonage World customer plans include unlimited domestic calling, which includes U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico, and unlimited calling to landline phones in more than 60 countries, including India, Mexico, and China, and unlimited calling to mobile phones in certain of those countries. The Vonage North America plan includes unlimited calling across the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico. Each of our Consumer calling plans provides a number of basic features including call waiting, caller ID with name, call forwarding, and voicemail. Our plans also include unlimited Vonage Visual Voicemail, which is “readable voicemail” delivered via email or SMS text message, Vonage Extensions, which extends the plan, and in-bound calling, to additional phone numbers and devices, and selective call block, which allows users to block unwanted calls. We also offer, in some cases for additional fees, features such as area code selection, virtual phone number, and web-enabled voicemail. Additionally, we also provide similar product offerings to customers in both Canada and the United Kingdom.
Our mobile services include enhancements to our Consumer calling plans as well as mobile applications that can be initially downloaded for iPhone ® , iPad ® , iPod touch ® , and Android ® OS devices for free. 
In order to access our consumer services, a customer need only connect a standard telephone to a broadband Internet connection through a small Vonage-enabled device. After connecting the device, our customers can use their telephone to make and receive calls. Vonage-enabled devices allow customers to use the Internet connection for their computer and telephones at the same time while ensuring a high quality calling experience. We also offer a cordless multi-phone system solution. Our plug-and-play Vonage-enabled devices permit portability as customers can take their Vonage device to different locations where broadband service is available. We generally have not charged new customers for the adapters permitting use of our service.
NETWORK OPERATIONS
The Vonage network uses our customer’s existing or Vonage procured high-speed broadband Internet service to allow calls over the Internet either from a standard telephone through a Vonage-enabled device or through soft phone software or mobile client applications. Our UCaaS services are not dependent on any specific type or provider of Internet service, and our customers are free to change their Internet service provider in response to a competitive alternative, or because they have moved to a different location. For many of our Vonage Enterprise customers, our UCaaS services are delivered over the Company's private, nationwide, fault tolerant, secure IP MPLS network under multi-year contracts to provide the high level of interconnection quality and the ability to offer service level agreements, or SLA, guaranteeing certain levels of voice service performance.
Our network is scalable and geographically distributed for robustness, high availability, and reliability across multiple call processing sites, using regional data interconnection points, where calls to non-Vonage customers are interconnected with the public switched telephone network. We periodically assess the locations of our regional data connection points in connection with efforts to improve the quality of and efficiency in delivering our service. Our interconnections with the public switched telephone network, or IP/SIP networks, are made pursuant to commercial agreements we have with several telecommunications providers. Under these agreements, we transfer calls originated by our customers to other carriers who connect the call to the called party or connect peer to peer. We have a varying degree of settlement arrangements with our carrier partners for indirect third party or direct termination of our calls. The calls are routed from our network to other carriers’ interconnected circuits at co-location facilities in which we lease space. This method of connecting to the public switched telephone or IP/SIP networks allows us to expand capacity quickly, as necessary to meet call volume, and to provide redundancy within our network. 
Because Vonage’s system is standards based and not constrained to use any specific broadband service provider to connect to our customers, we can centrally manage and share resources across our customer base to minimize capital investment when entering new markets.
The following are also important in supporting our network operations:

• | Network Operations Center. We currently maintain a network operations center at our headquarters with monitoring redundancies at several points within our network. The network operations center monitors and manages the status and health of our network elements, allowing us to manage our network in real time, respond to alert notifications, and re-route network traffic as needed. We pursue a multi-faceted approach to managing our network to ensure high call quality and reliable communications services to our customers. For Business customers, we have operational centers on-site to monitor and manage network access traffic. We may consolidate these network operations centers in the future if greater efficiencies can be obtained. 

 6     VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017



• | Back Office Systems. In addition to our network management systems, we have developed a number of software systems that enable us to manage our network and service offerings more efficiently and effectively. Key aspects of these systems include: 


◦ | Network Quality Metrics. We have implemented a suite of advanced Big Data analysis tools that allow us to monitor and troubleshoot the performance of our calling and data network, customer premises equipment, and other associated calling elements in near real-time. This suite is proprietary and was developed specifically to address the needs that Vonage has in monitoring, analyzing, understanding, troubleshooting, maintaining, and operating a world-class consumer VoIP platform. 


◦ | Web Portal. We provide a fully functional customer Web portal that allows our customers to configure and manage almost all aspects of their service on the Internet without requiring intervention of a customer-care representative. The portal permits customers to add and change features and phone numbers, update billing information, and access call usage and billing details. 


◦ | Emergency Calling Service and Enhanced 911 Service. We have deployed E-911 service to approximately 99.99% of our U.S. consumer and small and home office customer base that is comparable to the emergency calling services provided to customers of traditional wireline telephone companies in the same area. Our E-911 service does not support the calls of our soft phone software users. The emergency calls of our soft phone software users are supported by a national call center. Not all Vonage products require 911 service capabilities, such as our mobile client products but we are fully compliant with E911 requirements of the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, for VOIP Interconnected providers. To enable us to effectively deploy and provide our E-911 service, we maintain an agreement with a provider that assists us in delivering emergency calls to an emergency service dispatcher at the public safety answering point, or PSAP, in the area of the customer’s registered location and terminating E-911 calls. We also contract for the national call center that operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week to receive certain emergency calls and for the maintenance of PSAP databases for the purpose of deploying and operating E-911 services. The databases include contact, technical infrastructure, boundary, and routing information for delivery of calls to a PSAP or emergency service providers in the United States. 


◦ | Local Number Portability. Our system allows our telephone replacement customers to port telephone numbers, which allows new customers to retain their existing telephone numbers when subscribing to our services. We rely on agreements with two service providers to facilitate the transfer of customer telephone numbers. In addition, we have engaged a provider that performs the third party verification of pertinent local number portability information from our subscribers prior to porting a customer from a local telephone company to us. 


◦ | Security. We have developed a service architecture and platform that uses industry-standard security techniques and allows us to remotely manage customer devices. Any Vonage-enabled device used by our customers can be securely managed by us, and these devices use authentication mechanisms to identify themselves to our service in order to place and receive calls. We regularly update our protocols and systems to protect against unauthorized access. As discussed in "Item 1A Risk Factors", security breaches and other cybersecurity or technological risks could compromise our information, systems and network and expose us to liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. 

MARKETING
Our marketing objective is to help drive growth and revenue across our business and consumer markets. We employ an integrated multi-channel approach to marketing, whereby we evaluate and focus our efforts on efficient marketing vehicles to accomplish our goals with the greatest return on investment. To do this, we make use of both broad-reaching and highly-targeted media channels. 
For our business customers, our primary source of lead acquisition is digital marketing in the form of search engine marketing, digital advertising, social media advertising, and affiliate programs. We also utilize database marketing and lead aggregators to source business leads. We use direct marketing and account-based marketing to help source leads and create interest in our solutions. We have a significant strategy of using third-party and proprietary events to source business leads and convert prospects. For our residential customers, we have highly optimized our acquisition approach and focus mainly on digital advertising channels.
We make use of marketing research to gain consumer insights into brand, product, and service performance, and utilize those learnings to improve our messaging and media plans. Market research is also leveraged in the areas of testing, retention marketing, and product marketing to ensure we bring compelling products and services to market for our customers.
 7     VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017


We believe our brand is a meaningful factor for customers as they consider business services. We invest in our brand in order to retain and expand our customer base and to position Vonage as a technology leader that delivers innovative, unified communication services, serving the full range of businesses and enterprises. We expect these investments to continue as we further establish Vonage as a leading business services brand and pivot beyond our residential brand heritage.
SALES AND DISTRIBUTION
Enterprise Sales
In order to continue to expand in the enterprise sales channel, which we define as businesses larger than 1,000 seats, our enterprise sales organization is positioned to provide high quality business services for Enterprise, through our fully managed solution, which utilizes BroadSoft’s enterprise-grade call processing platform, with a broad portfolio of products delivered over our own private, national MPLS network, with 21 Points-of-Presence, or POPs, across the country and our own team of service delivery project managers using our proprietary provisioning tool Zeus, or with SmartWan, as well as our industry leading CPaaS products. Additionally, Contact Center solutions are commonly integrated into Enterprise solutions
Field Sales and Inside Sales - SMB and Midmarket
We utilize our team of sales agents, primarily based in geographic territories comprising customers and prospects, which we refer to as our field sales team, to market and sell our business services. These field sales agents utilize a consistent, automated, highly-structured sales process to effectively educate prospective customers regarding our services. We have developed a scalable model applicable to both existing and new markets. We now have field sales presence in 20 markets within the United States and made significant expansion into new markets globally primarily supporting Nexmo. For customers in the SMB segment, we leverage an Inside Sales team to provide solutions across our cloud communications offerings.
Channel Sales
In addition to inside sales and our field sales team, we also have a dedicated team focused on channel sales who work with our channel partners to market and sell our business services, which helps to broaden our sales distribution. In 2017, we continued to develop and expand this channel program by adding new senior management, channel managers, and additional national master agents. We now have a broad and deep coverage of the U.S. market through a network of over 20,000 sub agents and resellers. 
Self-Service
Customers can subscribe to our consumer services at our websites, http://www.vonage.com, http://www.vonage.ca, http://www.vonage.co.uk and several affiliate websites, or through multiple toll free numbers including 1-877-4VONAGE. Business customers can subscribe to our services at our websites, including https://business.vonage.com/, http://www.vonagebusiness.com, https://enterprise.vonage.com, and https://www.nexmo.com, or through toll free numbers including 1-877-862-2562 and 1- 855-593-7326. Additionally, Nexmo's API enablement and developer focus lends itself to a self-service model. Our developers can register, sign up and test, and scale their businesses easily and quickly without having to engage with anyone at Nexmo. This allows customers to self-provision their accounts with the aim of improving the customer experience while reducing customer acquisition costs. 
Customer Support
Consumer. We offer our customers support 24 hours a day, seven days a week through both our comprehensive online account management website and via our support number, chat or email. Many customers use our self-service website when they have a question or problem with their service and are able to resolve their concerns online without needing to speak to a customer care representative. Our customers can manage almost all aspects of their accounts online. This capability empowers our customers through self-service and reduces our customer care expenses.
Customers who cannot or do not wish to resolve their questions through our website may contact a customer care representative through our support number, chat or email. We staff our customer care organization through a combination of our own employees and outsourced customer care representatives. All new customer care representatives are trained through an established program developed by Vonage. We also have a separate team that provides advanced technical support for resolving customers’ complex issues. We use extensive monitoring of call quality and customer satisfaction scores to determine additional training or coaching requirements for individual associates and to drive continuous improvement in our processes, policies, and technology. We offer support in English, Spanish, Tagalog and French Canadian.
 8     VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017


Small and Medium Businesses.  We have specialized teams of customer care representatives to work with customers in every stage of their life cycle, including porting specialists to transfer or port existing phone numbers, an order entry team to help customers bring their new phone system online, as well as billing and product specialists. Customers can also utilize our extensive online support resources, complete with cataloged feature descriptions, how-to videos and other key resources to help them enable the many system features. Additionally, our representatives have ready access to a full support team - from technical support pros and billing specialists, to engineers and product experts.
Medium and Large Enterprise.  Our larger business customers benefit from a robust service delivery team comprised of team members specializing in project management, voice and data provisioning, and line number porting. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We believe that our technological position depends primarily on the experience, technical expertise, and creative ability of our employees. We currently own over 185 issued U.S. patents as well as a number of foreign patents and have more than 60 pending U.S. patent applications along with a number of foreign patent applications. We routinely review our technological developments with our technology staff and business units to identify the aspects of our technology that provide us with a technological or commercial advantage and seek intellectual property and patent protection as appropriate to protect such key proprietary technology in the United States and internationally, based on our assessment in light of applicable law. Our company policies require our employees to assign intellectual property rights developed in the scope of or in relation to our business to us and to treat proprietary know-how and materials as our confidential information.
In addition to developing technology and intellectual property, from time to time we evaluate opportunities for potential licensing and acquisition of third-party technology and intellectual property that may provide us with a strategic or commercial advantage in exchange for royalties or other consideration. As a result of these efforts, we have acquired multiple U.S. and foreign patents, and obtained licenses to numerous other patents. From time to time we receive letters from third parties inviting us to obtain patent licenses that might be relevant to our business. We also have become involved in litigation alleging that our products or services infringe on third party patents or other intellectual property rights. 
We are the owner of numerous United States and international trademarks and service marks and have applied for registration of our trademarks and service marks in the United States and abroad to establish and protect our brand names as part of our intellectual property strategy. Examples of our registered marks include Vonage®, Vonage Mobile®, Vonage Extensions®, and Nexmo ®.
We endeavor to protect our internally developed systems and technologies and maintain our trademarks and service marks. Typically, we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, partners, customers, and vendors in an effort to control access to and dissemination of our technology, software, business plans, documentation, and other proprietary information and trade secrets.
COMPETITION
We face continued strong competition from traditional telephone companies, cable companies, wireless companies, alternative communication providers, direct unified communications providers, legacy consumer VOIP businesses, large technology incumbents, and collaboration providers in the consumer, mobile, SMB and enterprise markets. Because most of our target customers are already purchasing communications services from one or more of these providers, our success is dependent upon our ability to attract these customers away from their existing providers. We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our ability to attract and retain customers are price, call quality, brand awareness, customer service, network and system reliability, service features and capabilities, scalability, usability, simplicity, mobile integration and the unique ability to deliver CPaaS communications tools to business customers in addition to our UCaaS offerings.
There is a continuing trend toward consolidation of compeitive companies, including the acquisition of alternative communication providers by Internet product and software companies with significant resources. In addition, certain of our competitors have partnered and may in the future partner with other competitors to offer products and services, leveraging their collective competitive positions. We also are subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies, which could give rise to significant new competition.
Business
In connection with our cloud communications products, we face competition from the traditional telephone and cable companies as discussed above, as well as from vendors of premises-based solutions and/or hosted solutions including the following:

• | Independent cloud services providers;


• | Premises-based business communication equipment providers;


• | Hosted communication services providers;

• | Traditional technology companies; and


• | Emerging competitors in technology companies.

As the cloud communications market evolves, and the convergence of voice, video, messaging, mobility and data networking technologies accelerates, we may face competition in the future from companies that do not currently compete in the market, including companies that currently compete in other sectors, companies that serve consumers rather than business customers, or companies which expand their market presence to include cloud communications.
Consumer
Traditional telephone and cable companies
The traditional telephone and cable companies are our primary competitors for our broadband telephone services. Traditional telephone companies in particular have historically dominated their regional markets. These traditional phone and cable company competitors are substantially larger and better capitalized than we are and have the advantage of a large existing customer base. Many of these competitors are continuing to make substantial investments in delivering broadband Internet access, VoIP phone service, and cable television to their customers and they often have larger product development and marketing budgets than us. Providing home phone, Internet access, and cable television to many of our existing and potential customers may enhance their image as trusted providers of services.
The traditional phone and cable companies own networks that include a “last mile” connection to substantially all of our existing and potential domestic customers as well as the places our customers call domestically. As a result, the vast majority of the calls placed by a Vonage customer are carried over the “last mile” by a traditional phone company, and we indirectly pay access charges to these competitors for each of these calls. In contrast, traditional wireline providers do not pay us when their customers call our customers.
Cable companies and, in many cases traditional phone companies, are also aggressively using their existing customer relationships to bundle services. For example, they bundle Internet access, cable television, and home phone service with an implied price for the phone service that may be significantly below ours. In addition, such competitors may in the future require new customers or existing customers making changes to their service to purchase voice services when purchasing high speed Internet access. Certain traditional phone companies are also able to bundle wireless telephone service. Many of these competitors are able to advertise on their local access channels with no significant out-of-pocket cost and through mailings in bills with little marginal cost. They also receive advertising time as part of their relationships with television networks and are able to use this time to promote their telephone service offerings.
Traditional phone and cable companies’ ownership of Internet connections to our customers could enable them to detect and interfere with the completion of our customers’ calls. While we are not aware of any such occurrence, it is unclear whether current regulations would permit these companies to degrade the quality of, give low priority to or block entirely the information packets and other data we transmit over their lines. In addition, these companies may attempt to charge their customers more for using our services.
Many traditional phone and cable companies routinely send technicians to customers’ premises to initiate service. Although this is expensive, it also can be more attractive to customers than installing their own router. In addition, these technicians may install an independent source of power, which can give customers assurance that their phone service will not be interrupted during power outages.
The traditional phone and cable companies have long-standing relationships with regulators, legislators, lobbyists, and the media. This can be an advantage for them because legislative, regulatory or judicial developments in our rapidly evolving industry could have a negative impact on us.
In many cases, we charge prices that are lower than prices charged by the traditional phone and cable companies. We believe that we also currently compete successfully with the traditional phone and cable companies on the basis of the features we offer that they may not, such as area code selection, portable service, virtual phone numbers, and readable voice mail. We offer many of these features at no extra charge.

Wireless telephone companies
We also compete with wireless phone companies for both our broadband telephone services, international long distance, and our mobile services. Some consumers use wireless phones, instead of VoIP phones, as a replacement for a wireline phone. Also, wireless phone companies increasingly are providing wireless broadband Internet access to their customers. As wireless providers offer more minutes at lower prices and other services that improve calling quality, their services have become more attractive to households as a competitive replacement for wireline service. In addition, wireless providers are also offering standalone wireless home services as well as the ability to link multiple devices for telephony service. Wireless telephone companies have a strong retail presence and have significant financial resources. We are developing next-generation services to meet the emerging needs of mobile and other connected device users by delivering easy-to-use applications that provide significant cost savings in large existing markets. We believe that our efforts will capitalize on favorable trends including the proliferation of low or no-cost Wi-Fi and other broadband around the world, accelerating smart phone adoption rates, and the growth of social communities.
Alternative communications providers
We also compete against alternative communication providers some of which are larger than us and have the ability to devote greater resources to their communications services. Some of these service providers, including Internet product and software companies, have chosen to sacrifice telephony revenue in order to gain market share or attract users to their platform and have offered their services at low prices or for free. While not all of these competitors currently offer the ability to call or be called by anyone not using their service, line portability, E-911 service, and customer service, in the future they may integrate such capabilities into their service offerings. As we continue the introduction of applications that integrate different forms of voice, video, messaging, and other services over multiple devices, we face competition from emerging competitors focused on similar integration, as well as from alternative communication providers.
