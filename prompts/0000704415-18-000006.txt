Item 1. Business
 
Overview
 
Tivity Health, Inc. was founded and incorporated in Delaware in 1981.  Through our three programs, SilverSneakers® senior fitness, Prime® Fitness and WholeHealth LivingTM, we are focused on advancing long-lasting health and vitality, especially in aging populations. The SilverSneakers senior fitness program is offered to members of Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement, and Group Retiree plans. We also offer Prime Fitness, a fitness facility access program, through commercial health plans and employers. Our national network of fitness centers delivers both SilverSneakers and Prime Fitness. In addition, a small portion of our fitness center network is available for discounted access through our WholeHealth Living program.  Our fitness network encompasses approximately 16,000 participating locations and more than 1,000 alternative locations that provide classes outside of traditional fitness centers.  Through our WholeHealth Living program, which we sell primarily to health plans, we offer a continuum of services related to complementary, alternative, and physical medicine.  Our WholeHealth Living programs include relationships with over 80,000 complementary, alternative, and physical medicine practitioners to serve individuals through health plans and employers who seek health services such as chiropractic care, acupuncture, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and more.
 
Effective July 31, 2016, we sold our total population health services ("TPHS") business to Sharecare, Inc. ("Sharecare").  The TPHS business took a systematic approach to keeping healthy people healthy, eliminating or reducing lifestyle risks and optimizing care for persistent or chronic conditions.  The TPHS business included our partnerships with Blue Zones, LLC, and Dr. Dean Ornish (the Blue Zones Project by Healthways™ and Dr. Dean Ornish's Program for Reversing Heart Disease™, respectively), our joint venture with Gallup, Inc. ("Gallup"), Navvis Healthcare, LLC ("Navvis"), MeYou Health, LLC ("MeYou Health"), and our international operations.  While Navvis and MeYou Health were part of our TPHS business, they were sold separately to other buyers in November 2015 and June 2016, respectively.  Results of operations for the TPHS business have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.
 
The Company is headquartered at 701 Cool Springs Boulevard, Franklin, Tennessee 37067.
 
Customer Contracts
 
Our customer contracts generally have initial terms of approximately three years.  Some of our contracts allow the customer to terminate early and/or determine on an annual basis to which of their members they will offer our programs.

Business Strategy
 
Our "A-B-C-D" strategy, which will leverage both our traditional physical footprint and developing digital platforms, is designed to (A) add new members in our three existing networks - SilverSneakers®, Prime® Fitness and WholeHealth LivingTM, (B) build engagement and participation among our current eligible members, (C) collaborate with partners to add new products and services that will leverage the value of our brand, and (D) deepen relationships with our partners and their instructors within our national network.  In addition to the A-B-C-D strategy, we are focused on supporting the ability of our health plan customers to meet the needs of their members as well as providing a valuable service to improve the health and well-being of the consumers we serve through our networks and with our programs.
 
We engage and support our members based on the needs and preferences of our customers.  Within our fitness networks, we have approximately 16,000 participating locations and more than 1,000 alternative locations that provide classes outside of traditional fitness centers. More than 14,000 of these participating locations within the national network deliver our proprietary SilverSneakers fitness program, and more than 10,000 of these locations offer Prime Fitness. 
 
Segment and Major Customer Information
 
We have one operating and reportable segment.  During 2017, Humana, Inc. ("Humana") and United Healthcare, Inc. ("United Healthcare") each comprised more than 10%, and together comprised approximately 38%, of our revenues from continuing operations.  Our primary contract with Humana was renewed in 2018 and continues through December 31, 2022.  Our primary contract with United Healthcare continues through December 31, 2020.  No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues from continuing operations in 2017.  See Note 19 to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Report relating to revenues from external customers and customer concentration.
 
Competition
 
The healthcare industry is highly competitive, and the manner in which services are provided is subject to continual change. Other entities, whose financial and marketing resources may exceed our resources, may choose to initiate or expand programs in competition with our offerings.
 
We believe we have certain advantages over our competitors such as our proprietary class programming; the brand recognition of programs such as SilverSneakers; the depth and breadth of our fitness center network relationships, which encompass approximately 16,000 participating locations; and the trusting connections with our members developed over 25 years that have generated nearly 600 million member visits to participating locations.  However, we cannot assure you that we can compete effectively with other entities such as those noted above.
 
Industry Integration and Consolidation
 
Consolidation remains an important factor in all aspects of the healthcare industry.  While we believe the size of our membership base provides us with the economies of scale to compete even in a consolidating market, we cannot assure you that we can effectively compete with companies formed as a result of industry consolidation or that we can retain existing customers if they are acquired by other entities that already have or contract for programs similar to ours or are not interested in our programs.
Governmental Regulation
 
Governmental regulation impacts us in a number of ways in addition to those regulatory risks presented under Item 1A. "Risk Factors" below.
 
Health Reform
 
In recent years, Congress and certain state governments have passed a large number of laws and regulations intended to result in major changes within the healthcare system. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the "ACA"), the most prominent of these efforts, changes how healthcare services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed through, among other things, expanded health insurance coverage, reduced growth in Medicare

program spending and the establishment of programs that tie reimbursement to care quality and value. However, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the ongoing effects of the ACA because the presidential administration and certain members of Congress have stated their intent to repeal or make significant changes to the ACA, its implementation or its interpretation. For example, in 2017, Congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the ACA's individual mandate, effective January 2019. The president has signed an executive order that directs agencies to minimize "economic and regulatory burdens" of the ACA, but it is unclear how this executive order will be implemented. It is difficult to predict whether, when or how the ACA will be further changed, what alternative provisions, if any, will be enacted, the timing of implementation of any alternative provisions, and the impact of alternative provisions on providers and other healthcare industry participants.
 
The ACA, as currently structured, contains provisions that affect our customers, including commercial health plans and Medicare Advantage programs. The ACA has decreased the number of uninsured individuals and expanded coverage through the expansion of public programs and private sector health insurance. However, the ACA also may increase costs and/or reduce the revenues of our customers or prospective customers. For example, the ACA prohibits commercial health plans from using gender, health status, family history, or occupation to set premium rates, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions, and bans annual benefit limits. In addition, the ACA established uniform minimum medical loss ratios ("MLRs") for health plans, requiring a minimum percentage of health coverage premium revenue to be spent on healthcare medical costs and quality improvement expenses. The ACA also reduced premium payments to Medicare Advantage plans such that the managed care per capita payments paid by HHS to Medicare Advantage plans are now, on average, approximately equal to those for traditional Medicare. While the ACA provides for bonuses to Medicare Advantage plans that achieve service benchmarks and quality ratings, overall payments to Medicare Advantage plans have been significantly reduced under the ACA.
 
Other Laws
 
While many of the governmental and regulatory requirements affecting healthcare delivery generally do not directly apply to us, our customers must comply with a variety of regulations including those governing Medicare Advantage plans and their marketing and the licensing and reimbursement requirements of federal, state and local agencies. Certain of our services, including health service utilization management and certain claims payment functions, require licensure by state government agencies. We are subject to a variety of legal requirements in order to obtain and maintain such licenses.
 
Federal privacy regulations issued pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") extensively restrict the use and disclosure of individually-identifiable health information by health plans, most healthcare providers, and certain other entities (collectively, "covered entities"). Federal security regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA require covered entities to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic individually-identifiable health information. Because we handle individually-identifiable health information on behalf of covered entities, we are considered a "business associate" and are required to comply with most aspects of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations.
 
Violations of HIPAA and its implementing regulations may result in criminal penalties and in substantial civil penalties for each violation. These penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. In addition, we may be contractually or directly obligated to comply with any applicable state laws or regulations related to the confidentiality and security of confidential personal information. In the event of a data breach involving individually-identifiable health information, we are subject to contractual obligations and state and federal requirements that require us to notify our customers. These requirements may also require us or our customers to notify affected individuals, regulatory agencies, and the media of the data breach. Non-permitted uses and disclosures of unsecured individually identifiable health information are presumed to be breaches for which notice is required, unless it can be demonstrated that there is a low probability the information has been compromised.
 
Federal law contains various prohibitions related to false statements and false claims, some of which apply to private payors as well as federal programs. Our contracts with Medicare Advantage plans may subject us to a number of obligations, including billing and reimbursement requirements, prohibitions on fraudulent and abusive conduct and related training and screening obligations. Actions may be brought under the federal False Claims Act by the government as well as by private individuals, known as "whistleblowers," who are permitted to

share in any settlement or judgment. Liability under the federal False Claims Act arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The federal False Claims Act defines the term "knowingly" broadly. There are many other potential bases for liability under the federal False Claims Act, including knowingly and improperly avoiding repayment of an overpayment received from the government and the knowing failure to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment. The submission of claims for services or items generated in violation of certain "fraud and abuse" provisions of the Social Security Act, including the anti-kickback provisions, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the federal False Claims Act. In some cases, whistleblowers, the federal government, and some courts have taken the position that entities that allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the federal self-referral prohibition commonly known as the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the federal False Claims Act.
 
From time to time, participants in the healthcare industry, including our company and our customers, may be subject to actions under the federal False Claims Act or other fraud and abuse laws, including similar state statutes, and it is not possible to predict the impact of such actions. Violations of applicable laws may result in significant civil and criminal penalties. For example, violations of the federal False Claims Act may result in penalties of three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus substantial mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim. These penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.
 
Because of the international operations previously conducted as part of our TPHS business that we sold to Sharecare in July 2016, we were subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") and similar anti-bribery laws of other countries in which we provided services prior to the sale. The FCPA and similar antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage. Failure to comply with the FCPA and similar legislation prior to the sale of our TPHS business could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines and penalties.
 
Employees
 
As of February 21, 2018, we had approximately 475 employees. Our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements.  We believe we have good relationships with our employees.
