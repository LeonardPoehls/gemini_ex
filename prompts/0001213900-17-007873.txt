Our Industry
 
Legalization of recreational marijuana initially in Colorado and Washington and the growing number of jurisdictions with medical marijuana laws spawned a new industry in America in 2014. Under Voter approved Amendment 64, the State of Colorado became the first state to legalize the use of recreational marijuana. Colorado residents, who are at least 21 years of age with photo identification, may legally purchase as much as one ounce of marijuana in a single transaction. Non-Colorado residents, bearing the same identification, may purchase as much as one-quarter ounce. Marijuana cannot be consumed in any public space, including the shops where it was purchased. In 2015, Oregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia legalized marijuana for recreational use. In 2016, California, Nevada, Massachusetts and Maine legalized marijuana for recreational use. At this time, sales currently remain banned in the District of Columbia. Additionally, 29 states have legalized marijuana for medical purposes.
 
Grow Solutions Holdings, Inc. provides products and services to the regulated legal cannabis industry. At this time, the Company currently focuses its operations in the following areas:
 
Retail Grow Stores and Distribution
 
Our business model is based on the aggressive consolidation of what we believe to be the “best of breed” operations for the retail sale and distribution of indoor and outdoor garden supplies and grow equipment, including for the legal growing of cannabis, throughout the United States, and eventually world-wide, through aggressive acquisition and consolidation of smaller businesses and organic growth of the existing business. Our growth strategy and continued success depends largely on our ability to (i) properly service our customers; (ii) acquire cash flowing, profitable companies; (iii) successfully integrate our acquisitions and eliminate operational inefficiencies; (iv) increase sales; and (v) establish and sell branded growing mediums and nutrients.
 
We plan to leverage our strengths in industry knowledge and operational experience to identify and systematically integrate a network of standalone retail grow stores. The Company’s management believes retail grow stores in the legal cannabis industry are ripe for successful consolidation. We have experience in the legal cannabis industry and we have developed a strategic plan for identifying potential acquisition targets. Management of the Company is recognized in the industry, which we believe will enable the Company to efficiently identify, negotiate and close acquisitions. We believe the consolidation of these companies will allow the consolidated group to achieve significant savings throughout the value chain due to synergies and economies of scale.
 
As a larger entity, we believe we will be able to access growth capital more easily than we would be as a single, early stage company, and we project that the synergy of multiple business units leveraging shared marketing and sales functions will further increase revenue and accelerate growth, while simultaneously reducing the cost of customer acquisition. We believe this will allow the collective group to attain an improved market share more quickly and allow capital investors to invest in a larger pool of business units, representing a greater opportunity to further seize market share.
 
Consumer Products
 
We design and manufacture products sold in tobacco stores, smoke shops and cannabis dispensaries. These products include vaporizers, extraction presses, quartz accessories and storage solutions.
 
Job Posting Platform
 
On June 29, 2015, the Company and Jasper Group Holdings, Inc. entered into a Joint Marketing Agreement (the “Joint Marketing Agreement”) to provide services related to website creation for a legal cannabis job posting platform. We plan for the website to include an employee leasing program and allow employers, recruiters and potential employees to communicate through its platform for a fee. All potential employees will be screened with background checks by independent third parties and provided the necessary applications and related materials for individuals to become licensed in the legal cannabis industry on a state by state basis. In accordance with the terms of the Joint Marketing Agreement, Jasper Group Holdings, Inc. shall invest all funds necessary to form the website. At this time, the website has been initiated and is still under construction. The Company plans to launch its job posting platform by the end of fiscal 2017.
Consulting and Advisory
 
The Company delivers comprehensive consulting services that includes design and construction to approved and licensed legal cannabis operators, as well as assistance with licensure and related applications for potential legal cannabis operators. The Company’s business plan is based on the future growth of the regulated legal cannabis market in the United States. The Company will provide general advisory services for business development, facilities design and construction, cultivation and retail operations, marketing and the improvement and expansion of existing operations.

Competition
 
All of the Company’s planned retail and online distribution channels will compete for customers and sales with many different companies and products that are competitive today and likely to be even more competitive in the future. Accordingly, we believe it is essential that the Company and its verticals continue to develop, improve, and refine the value propositions that are offered to its customers.
 
Competition in the legal cannabis industry is significant, as competing companies and retail grow stores continually open. With regard to competition in the California, Colorado and Washington market, there are numerous retail indoor and outdoor gardening stores that we believe will compete with the Company for business.
 
The Company’s size relative to its competition is difficult to gauge as most of our competition is privately held and does not publicly report their earnings. We do know of several competitors who own and operate more retail indoor and outdoor gardening stores than we currently do, but they are privately held and, therefore, we are unable to determine their size in terms of annual revenue.
 
We also face competition from other public companies that offer equipment and expendables. Moreover, as the negative stigma associated with some types of urban gardening such as legal cannabis plants diminishes, it is very possible that other better capitalized public and private companies may enter the market and may effectively challenge the value proposition offered by the Company. These competitors may be able to attract customers more easily because of their financial resources. Our larger competitors can also devote substantially more resources to business development and may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. We plan to compete on the strength of our multiple business verticals, product offerings, and management.
 
While our management believes that we have the opportunity to be successful in the legal cannabis industry, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in accomplishing our business initiatives, or that we will be able to maintain significant levels of revenues, or recognize net income, from the sale of our products and services.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We do not currently hold the rights to any intellectual property.
 
Regulations
 
Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal law.
 
A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse.  The Department of Justice defines Schedule I controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.”  If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act in the states which have legalized marijuana for recreational or medical use, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
As of April 30, 2015, 29 states and the District of Columbia allow their citizens to use medical marijuana.  In 2015, cannabis was legalized for recreational use in Washington D.C., Oregon, Washington, Colorado and Alaska. In 2016, cannabis was also legalized for recreational use in California, Nevada, Massachusetts and Maine. The state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. At this time, the Company does not believe that President Trump and his administration will have a negative effect on the Company and its business operations. The Company believes there is overwhelming support for both recreational and medical cannabis use and there have been multiple bills introduced at the State level to provide support to the Cannabis industry in the event of action taken by President Trump and his administration.


However, any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of such current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to the Company and its shareholders.  While the Company does not intend to harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, the Company may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal or state governments or the enactment of new and more restrictive laws.

Following the sale of the Make-Whole Shares by the Assignee: (i) in the event that Assignee receives net proceeds from such sale which, when added to the Realized Amount from the prior relevant conversion notice, is less than the conversion amount specified in the relevant conversion notice, Assignee shall deliver an additional make-whole notice to the Company and the Company obligation to issue Make-Whole Shares shall continue until the conversion amount has been fully satisfied; and (ii) in the event that Assignee received net proceeds from the sale of Make-Whole Shares in excess of the conversion amount specified in the relevant conversion notice, such excess amount shall be applied to satisfy any and all amounts owed hereunder in excess of the conversion amount specified in the relevant conversion notice.
