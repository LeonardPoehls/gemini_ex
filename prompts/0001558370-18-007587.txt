precision metal and plastic fabrication.  We further differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing innovative, custom capabilities, which improve high-precision manufacturing efficiency and speed-to-market for our customers.
     Our Business Model
     Our business model is to accelerate the widespread adoption of MIM, along with other key technologies, including automation, robotics, and production software in traditional manufacturing, thereby benefiting from the elimination of inefficiencies currently present in the global supply chain.  More specifically, the two key pillars of our business strategy are centered on the following areas:
· | Holistic Manufacturing Solution. The metal and plastic fabrication industries are highly fragmented sectors with numerous single-solution providers. Given the inefficiencies associated with working with these disjointed groups, many manufacturers seek to improve their supplier base by working with more scaled, holistic providers. Our strategy is to facilitate the consolidation and streamlining of global supply chains by offering a holistic solution to our customers’ manufacturing needs. In particular, ARC provides a “one-stop shop” solution to our customers by offering a spectrum of highly advanced products, processes, and services, thereby delivering highly-engineered precision components at efficient production yields.

Kecy is a precision metal stamping company that also offers value-added secondary design and production processing.  The Kecy acquisition, along with the purchase of certain real property from Munson used in Kecy operations, allows ARC to provide its customers with metal stamping applications in order to offer a more holistic solution and improve the speed-to-market.
     During 2017, the Company determined two subsidiaries, Tekna Seal LLC (“Tekna Seal”) and ARC Wireless, LLC, were not essential to core, ongoing growth operations and subsequently divested them.  Also, during 2017, the Company decided to divest General Flange & Forge LLC (“GF&F”) and classified the business as held for sale on June 30, 2017.  GF&F was sold on September 15, 2017 (see Note 3, Divestitures, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, for further information).  
     On July 21, 2018, the Company merged and consolidated its subsidiaries ATC, a colorado limited liability company, and Thixoforming, a Colorado limited liability company, into AFT, a Colorado corporation.  Following the merger and consolidation on June 22, 2018, AFT changed its name to ARC Coloardo, Inc.
     On July 17, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a plan to explore hiring a third party to help market and sell 3DMT.  On July 25, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with a third party to market 3DMT for sale.  The Company is currently assessing what a reasonable estimated sale price would be fore the sale of 3DMT.  
     Everest Hill Group Inc. (“Everest Hill Group”) has been our major stockholder since 2008.  Over its 35-year investment history, Everest Hill Group and its affiliated investment vehicles have invested in over 75 companies, including approximately 40 active portfolio companies.  We believe that Everest Hill Group’s successful investment track record and long-term investment horizon provides value to our Company and its shareholders.
     Industry Overview
     We serve the global manufacturing industry as a provider of holistic prototype development and production solutions.  In particular, we manufacture highly-engineered, precision components for OEMs in the medical and dental device, aerospace, defense, and automotive industries, among others.  While our manufacturing technologies continue to gain market acceptance, they currently represent a fractional share of the global manufacturing market.
     The global manufacturing industries we compete in are generally highly fragmented, consisting of many privately-held production companies and some publicly traded companies.  We believe the industry offers opportunities for consolidation, as many small, privately-held companies lack the financial resources to invest in the emerging technologies that are necessary to remain competitive.

· | Demand for Efficient and Consolidated Supply Chain. The existing supply chain offers opportunities for improvement as OEMs procure parts, components, and sub-assemblies from many suppliers. A large supplier base requires OEM customers to invest substantial time and capital in the coordination and management of their supply chains, with OEMs maintaining large numbers of employees devoted solely to procurement and supply chain management. Additionally, the lead times necessary to fulfill OEM purchase orders often require several weeks, or months, due to the time associated with tooling, testing, manufacturing, and shipping complex parts. Consequently, our OEM customers are seeking solutions that will achieve the following goals: 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reduced Lead Times. Our OEM customers experience production bottlenecks in the quoting and quick-turn/prototyping phases of the production cycle. In order to reduce overall lead times, our customers are seeking technologically enabled solutions that eliminate inefficiencies in their procurement process. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Rationalization of Suppliers. Many of our customers have implemented company-wide initiatives to reduce the complexity of their respective supply chains. In selecting their ongoing supply partners, these customers are seeking industry leaders that offer an established market presence, financial flexibility and stability, the ability to supply multiple parts/components and an established track record of supplying technologically advanced, highly engineered parts/components with rapid turnaround times. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Competitive Strengths
     We believe our competitive strengths include:
    
· | Leading Market Position in MIM, with High Barriers to Entry. We believe we are one of the largest companies in the fragmented global MIM industry. Further, we believe our unique, proprietary production processes, metallurgical expertise, longstanding customer relationships, well-established industry reputation, and track record for quality products and services provide us with a competitive advantage over other market participants. Additionally, we have made a sizeable capital investment in MIM machinery, as well as the software and other complementary services necessary to maintain and grow our business. We believe there are a limited number of other market participants of comparable size and experience, with the vast majority of competitors being substantially smaller in size, scale, capabilities, and expertise. We believe that the development of high-quality, commercially scalable MIM production would require any new competitors to invest significant capital and years of research and development before being able to commercially compete with us, thereby resulting in high barriers to entry for any new participants in the industry. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These technologies provide our customers with reduced order turnaround times and customized engineering solutions, while strengthening our customer relationships and enhancing our ability to market a broader and differentiated suite of products. We believe our capital investment and collective experience with these technologies would be difficult to replicate for smaller or limited-product-suite competitors. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Differentiated Business Model. We believe that our business model is highly differentiated from many of our competitors. Historically, we generally manufactured some of the most critical and difficult-to-produce components for our customers’ products. As such, we have been able to expand the scope of products we offer to our customers to include other value-added services, including plastic injection molding and rapid tool making, among others. We believe our full-service solution represents a distinct competitive advantage in the marketplace and will increasingly become an even more important value differentiator going forward. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Lean Manufacturing Technology and Operating Best Practices. We manage our manufacturing operation on a decentralized basis, whereby each of our operating subsidiaries is run by a general manager. Our general managers are often recognized experts in lean manufacturing and general operating best practices. We have an orientation process whereby lean-manufacturing leaders groom our rising managers and mentor them on operating efficiency and excellence. These internal best practices are shared among our facilities and implemented when we acquire or initiate new operations. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Business Strategy
     Our business strategy focuses on growing revenues through the addition of new customers, organically increasing our “wallet share” from existing customers, developing technology to improve the manufacturing process, and making strategic acquisitions to advance the scope and scale of our product offerings.  In order to achieve this, we have implemented the following strategic initiatives:
· | Provide Customers with Faster and Higher Quality Solutions. We believe that a key competitive differentiator in our business is utilizing technological solutions to increase customers’ speed-to-market. We believe our technology-enhanced service offerings can reduce lead times and produce greater manufacturing efficiency. We also focus on utilizing our team of engineers and production experts to engage with customers at the design phase of their product development and endeavor to have them adopt our solutions throughout the entire manufacturing process, from prototype through large-scale commercial production, in order to create a deeper long term partnership.

· | Cross-Sell Products and Services Across Our Customer Base. We are able to gain greater access and better serve our customers by cross-selling our full suite of products and services. We believe our customers are interested in new and complementary products and services our Company can offer, while at the same time valuing the simplification of their supply chains. Consequently, we have found cross-selling provides us with a compelling symbiotic strategy for revenue growth, and we plan to continue to capitalize on cross-selling opportunities as we add products and services to our existing capabilities. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand Sales Force and Marketing. We have a highly skilled, technically focused sales force and look to strategically expand our presence in markets and sectors as appropriate. Each ARC sales representative is generally responsible for selling our complete suite of solutions to target customers. Traditional sales methodologies are supported and complemented by our online initiatives. Further, we believe that international markets present a compelling growth opportunity for our business, and we have been exploring those opportunities. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We intend to identify, and where and when appropriate, continue to pursue acquisitions that meet our core strategic and financial criteria. In particular, we seek companies that offer complementary products and services to our existing portfolio, while at the same time, provide us with access to new customer bases to cross-sell our existing solutions. We believe there are numerous potential

      Reporting Segments
     See Note 13, Segment Information, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, for further information on our segments.
     Employees
     As of June 30, 2018, our global workforce, excluding contractors, totaled approximately 530 employees.  None of our U.S. employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  Substantially all of our international employees are members of unions or subject to workers’ councils or similar statutory arrangements.  Management considers its relations with all of its employees to be in good standing.     Customer Base
     Our largest five customers accounted for approximately 36.9% and 45.0% of our 2018 and 2017 revenue, respectively.  The concentration of our business with a relatively small number of customers may expose us to a material adverse effect if one or more of these large customers were to experience financial difficulty or were to cease being a customer for non-financial related issues.     Suppliers
     We have good working relationships with our suppliers.  Given our volume of purchases, we are often able to secure certain volume purchase discounts from our vendors.  Each of our manufacturing facilities has a network of local partners that work very closely with us to deliver additional value-added services for manufactured components.
     For certain of our raw material and component purchases, including certain polymers, copper rod, copper and aluminum tapes, fine aluminum wire, steel wire, carbon steel, and other components, we are dependent on key suppliers. While we rely upon long-term relationships, we generally do not enter into long-term contracts with our key suppliers.  The timely procurement of necessary raw materials is critical to each of our operations.  Consequently, poor supply capacity amid tight demand for these materials, as well as natural disasters or accidents, or other events that negatively impact our suppliers, could adversely affect their timely procurement and harm our business.
     Regulation
     Our operations are regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment, including laws governing the discharge of pollutants into the soil, air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites.  We have infrastructures in place to ensure that our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations.  The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or competitive position, and we do not believe that they will in the future.  The imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations or a determination that we are responsible for the release of hazardous substances at our sites could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters.  While no material exposures have been identified to date that we are aware of, there can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no problem is currently known.
     As an exporter, we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products, services and technology from the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations.  In the U.S., these laws include, among others, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) administered by the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, and trade sanctions, regulations and embargoes administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control.  Certain of our products have military or strategic applications and are on the munitions list of the ITAR or represent so-called “dual use” items governed by the EAR.  As a result, these products require individual validated licenses in order to be exported to certain 

 
  6

 
jurisdictions.  Any failures to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, adverse publicity and restrictions on our ability to export our products, and repeat failures could carry more significant penalties.  Any changes in export regulations may further restrict the export of our products.  The length of time required by the licensing processes can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue.  Any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.
     Intellectual Property
     We actively pursue development of intellectual property.  We have registered and applied for the registration of U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights.  Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology and processes.  However, most of the technology used in our business is unpatented, but is protected by trade secrets and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements.  We are not currently engaged in any intellectual property litigation, nor are there any intellectual property claims pending either by or against us.     Available Information
