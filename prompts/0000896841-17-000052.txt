ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

OVERVIEW
We develop, market, sell, and support software and hardware for digital media content production, management and distribution. We do this by providing an open and efficient platform for digital media, along with a comprehensive set of tools and workflow solutions, that enable the creation, distribution and optimization of audio and video content. Digital media are video, audio or graphic elements in which the image, sound or picture is recorded and stored as digital values, as opposed to analog or tape-based signals. Our products are used in production and post-production facilities; film studios; network, affiliate, independent and cable television stations; recording studios; live-sound performance venues; advertising agencies; government and educational institutions; corporate communications departments; and by independent video and audio creative professionals, as well as aspiring professionals. Projects produced using our products include feature films, television programming, live events, news broadcasts, sports productions, commercials, music, video and other digital media content.
Our mission is to create the most powerful and collaborative media network that enables the creation, distribution and monetization of the most inspiring content in the world. Guided by our Avid Everywhere strategic vision, we strive to deliver the industry’s most open, tightly integrated and efficient platform for media, connecting content creation with collaboration, asset protection, distribution and consumption of media in the world - from the most prestigious and award-winning feature films, music recordings, and television shows, to live concerts, sporting events and news broadcasts. We have been honored over time for our technological innovation with 14 Emmy Awards, one Grammy Award, two Oscars and the first ever America Cinema Editors Technical Excellence Award. Our solutions were used in all 2017 Oscar nominated films for Best Picture, Best Film Editing and Best Original Score. Every 2017 Grammy nominee for Record of the Year and Album of The Year relied on our music creation solutions powered by our MediaCentral Platform.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
On January 26, 2017, we entered into a securities purchase agreement, or the Securities Purchase Agreement, with Jetsen, pursuant to which we have agreed to sell to Jetsen shares of our common stock in an amount equal to between 5% and 9.9% of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis. The purchase price for the shares is $18.2 million and will be payable in cash. The closing of the sale is subject to closing conditions, including China regulatory approvals. The exact number of shares to be issued and sold at closing will be determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock before closing. At the same time, we also entered into an Exclusive Distributor Agreement with Jetsen, pursuant to which Jetsen will become the exclusive distributor for our products and services in the Greater China region. The Distributor Agreement has a five-year term and Jetsen is required to make at least $75.8 million of aggregate purchases under the agreement over the first three years.
On March 14, 2017, or the Effective Date, we entered into an amendment, or the Amendment, to our existing financing agreement dated February 26, 2016, or the Financing Agreement, with the lenders party thereto. The Amendment modifies the covenant requiring us to maintain a Leverage Ratio (defined to mean the ratio of (a) consolidated total funded indebtedness to (b) consolidated EBITDA) such that following the Effective Date, we are required to keep a Leverage Ratio of no greater than 3.50:1.00 for the four quarters ending March 31, 2017, 4.20:1.00 for the four quarters ending June 30, 2017, 4.75:1.00 for the four quarters ending September 30, 2017, 4.80:1.00 for the four quarters ending December 31, 2017, 4:40:1 for each of the four quarters ending March 31, 2018 through March 31, 2019, respectively, and thereafter declining over time from 3.50:1.00 to 2.50:1.00. Following the Effective Date, interest accrues on outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and the term loan (each as defined in the Financing Agreement) at a rate of either the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Financing Agreement) plus 7.25% or a Reference Rate (as defined in the Financing Agreement) plus 6.25%, at the option of Avid.

CORPORATE STRATEGY
Technology has enabled almost every aspect of how we live to become increasingly digitized, and acceleration of digitization is having a tremendous impact on the media industry and altering the industry value chain. Today’s consumers are empowered to create and consume content on-demand-anywhere, anytime. Organizations in the media industry are under pressure to connect and automate the entire creation-to-consumption workflow, and are facing a number of challenges, including:

• | Increasing rate of content creation – many organizations are feeling intense pressure to create more and more content, specially tailored to each audience niche, while also facing greater competition from nimble players. At the same time, access to creative tools is wider today then ever before, giving more people the ability to tell their stories.


• | Exponential growth of distribution platforms – the economic models of new distribution platforms are often not fully matured or realized. Many organizations need to embrace new opportunities while also maximizing heritage business. 


• | Continued increase in content consumption – there has been a tremendous increase in viewership in the last decade, but it is spread across many outlets and channels, and while there is this increase in viewership, it is dwarfed by an increase in competitive content. In addition, with growing audience fragmentation, brand equity and relevance is even more critical today.


• | Media technology budgets – today’s economic realities are placing pressure on media technology budgets, while content output must increase exponentially to deliver on the market requirements. Content creators and distributors have to do a lot more, with a lot less.

We believe our strategic understanding and technological expertise uniquely position us to effectively help organizations in the media industry navigate through this period of unprecedented change. Our products and solutions allow our customers to (i) create high-quality, engaging and immersive content, (ii) distribute to more outlets and devices, (iii) maximize and protect the value of media assets, and (iv) create operational and capital efficiency. Our unique position across the media industry includes:

• | the comprehensive tools and solutions to create, distribute and optimize media, with proven end-to-end solutions that are precisely designed to optimize content production and media workflow efficiencies;


• | the open, integrated and efficient platform designed for media, providing an ecosystem that future-proofs and protects technology investments;


• | flexible deployment models, licensing options and commercial structures, including premise, public or private cloud, or hybrid deployments; perpetual, subscription or enterprise licensing; and flexible commercial models, all adaptable to the individual needs of each client; and


• | a preeminent client and user community that helps shape our collective future, including the industry’s most inspirational and award-winning thought leaders, innovators and storytellers that keep our community at the forefront of creative techniques and workflow best practices.

Our strategy is built on three pillars, Avid Everywhere, The Avid Advantage and the Avid Customer Association, or ACA. Avid Everywhere is our strategic vision for connecting creative professionals and media organizations with their audiences in a more powerful, efficient, collaborative, and profitable way. Central to the Avid Everywhere vision is the Avid MediaCentral Platform, an open, extensible, and customizable foundation that streamlines and simplifies workflows by integrating all Avid or third party products and services that run on top of it. The platform provides secure and protected access, which enables the creation and delivery of content faster and easier through a set of modular application suites and new public and private marketplaces, that together, represent an open, integrated and flexible media production and distribution environment for the media industry. The Avid Advantage complements Avid Everywhere by offering a new standard in service, support and education to enable our customers to derive more efficiency from their Avid investment. Finally, the ACA is an association of dedicated media community visionaries, thought leaders and users designed to provide essential strategic leadership to the media industry, facilitate collaboration between Avid and key industry leaders and visionaries, and strengthen relationships between our customers and us.

The set of modular application suites and public and private marketplaces on the Avid MediaCentral Platform are summarized below:

• | Artist Suite encompasses all of our audio and video creative tools for editing, mixing, and live sound production. Products and tools in the Artist Suite can be deployed on premise, cloud-enabled, or through a hybrid approach. Users can collaborate to access, edit, and share the same media; and collaborate with others as if they were all in the same facility.


• | Media Suite offers solutions to securely manage, distribute, and re-purpose assets. The solutions will be based on a new metadata tracking system, where metadata will be generated algorithmically and provide a greater level of detail, making it possible to take a flexible and adaptable view of assets at any stage of the lifecycle.


• | Studio Suite comprises in-studio tools for on-air program and viewership enhancement, including 3D real-time graphics, replay servers, sports enhancements and virtual studios.


• | Storage Suite refers to all of our products and tools used to capture, store, and deliver media, including online storage, nearline storage, and ingest/playout servers. These products and tools work in close concert with the Media Suite’s tagging and asset management.


• | Marketplaces provide an easy and secure way for the content creators to share or publish their products or elements. The marketplaces are designed for collaboration and distribution among individuals and enterprises.

Another key element of our strategy is our transition to a subscription or recurring revenue based model. We started offering cloud-based subscription licensing options for some of our products and solutions in 2014, and have more than 60,000 paying cloud-enabled subscribers at the end of 2016, a 141% increase from 2015. These licensing options offer choice in pricing and deployment to suit our customers’ needs and are expected to increase recurring revenue on a longer term basis. However, during our transition to a recurring revenue model, we expect that our revenue, deferred revenue, and cash flow from operations will be adversely affected as an increasing portion of our total revenue is recognized ratably rather than up front, and as new product offerings are sold at a wider variety of price points.
As a complement to our core strategy, we continue to review and implement programs throughout the Company to reduce costs, increase operational efficiencies, align talent and enhance our business, including the cost efficiency program announced in February 2016. The cost efficiency program encompasses a series of measures intended to allow us to more efficiently operate in a leaner, and more directed cost structure. These measures include reductions in our workforce, facilities consolidation, transferring certain business processes to lower cost regions, and reducing other third-party services costs. We anticipate that the cost efficiency program will be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of 2017

Our NewsCutter option and iNews systems are designed for the fast-paced world of news production. Our Avid Symphony option is used during the “online” or “finishing” stage of post-production, during which the final program is assembled in high resolution with finished graphics, visual effects, color grading and audio tracks. In September 2016, we introduced the next-generation newsroom, based around a complete story-centric workflow including multiple Avid solutions and new feature enhancements for modern newsroom management and news production. This new story-centric workflow puts the story at the center of news operations from planning to delivery, and provides the tools news teams need to plan, gather, create, collaborate, manage and deliver news to a wider range of viewers across multiple platforms. Our next-generation newsroom builds on the openness and integration of the Avid MediaCentral Platform.

COMPETITION
Our customer markets are highly competitive and subject to rapid change and declining average selling prices. The competitive landscape is fragmented with a large number of companies providing various types of products and services in different markets and geographic areas. We provide integrated solutions that compete based on total value workflow, features, quality, service and price. Companies with which we compete in some contexts may also act as our partners in other contexts, such as large enterprise customer environments.
Certain companies that compete with us across some of our products and solutions are listed below by the market in which they compete:

• | Broadcast and Media: The Associated Press Inc., Belden Inc., Bitcentral Inc., ChyronHego Corporation, Dalet S.A., EVS Corporation, Harmonic Inc., Imagine Communications Corp, Ross Video Limited and Vizrt Ltd., among others. 


• | Audio and Video Post and Professional: Ableton AG, Autodesk Inc., Blackmagic Design Pty Ltd, Harman International Industries Inc., Universal Audio Inc. and Yamaha Corporation, among others. 

In addition, we compete across both previously mentioned markets with companies such as Adobe Systems Incorporated, Apple Inc., Editshare LLC, Quantum Corporation, Snell Advanced Media, Sony Corporation and EMC Corporation, among others.
Some of our principal competitors are substantially larger than we are and have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than us. For a discussion of these and other risks associated with our competitors, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
OPERATIONS
Sales and Services Channels 
We market and sell our products and solutions through a combination of direct, indirect and digital sales channels. Our direct sales channel consists of internal sales representatives serving select customers and markets. Our indirect sales channels include global networks of independent distributors, value-added resellers, dealers and retailers. Our digital sales channel is represented by the online Avid Marketplace.
We have significant international operations with offices in 24 countries and the ability to reach over 169 countries through a combination of our direct sales force and resellers. Sales to customers outside the United States accounted for 64%, 63% and 64%, of our total net revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Additional information about the geographic breakdown of our revenues and long-lived assets can be found in Note P to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. For additional information about risks associated with our international operations, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
We generally ship our products shortly after the receipt of an order. However, a high percentage of our revenues has historically been generated in the third month of each fiscal quarter and concentrated in the latter part of that month. Orders that may exist at the end of a quarter and have not been shipped are not recognized as revenues in that quarter and are included in revenue backlog.
Certain orders included in revenue backlog may be reduced, canceled or deferred by our customers. Our revenue backlog, as we define it, consists of firm orders received and includes both (i) orders where the customer has paid in advance of our performance obligations being fulfilled and (ii) orders for future product deliveries or services that have not yet been invoiced by us. The expected timing of the conversion of revenue backlog into revenue is based on current estimates and could change based on a number of factors, including (i) the timing of delivery of products and services, (ii) customer cancellations or change orders, (iii) changes in the estimated period of time Implied Maintenance Release PCS is provided to customers or (iv) changes in accounting standards or policies. Implied Maintenance Release PCS, as we define it, is the implicit obligation to make software updates available to customers over a period of time, representing implied post-contract customer support, 
8

and is deemed to be a deliverable in each arrangement and accounted for as a separate element. As there is no industry standard definition of revenue backlog, our reported revenue backlog may not be comparable with other companies. Additional information on our revenue backlog can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.”
We provide customer care services directly through regional in-house and contracted support centers and major-market field service representatives and indirectly through dealers, value-added resellers and authorized third-party service providers. Depending on the solution, customers may choose from a variety of support offerings, including telephone and online technical support, on-site assistance, hardware replacement and extended warranty, and software upgrades. In addition to customer care services, we offer a broad array of professional services, including installation, integration, planning and consulting services, and customer training.
Manufacturing and Suppliers 
Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of the testing of subassemblies and components purchased from third parties, the duplication of software, and the configuration, final assembly and testing of board sets, software, related hardware components and complete systems. In addition to our internal manufacturing operations, we rely on a network of contractors around the globe to manufacture many of our products, components and subassemblies. Our products undergo testing and quality assurance at the final assembly stage. We depend on sole-source suppliers for certain key hardware product components and finished goods, including some critical items. Although we have procedures in place to mitigate the risks associated with our sole-sourced suppliers, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain sole-sourced components or finished goods from alternative suppliers or that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms without a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. For the risks associated with our use of contractors and sole-source vendors, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Our company-operated manufacturing facilities, primarily for final assembly and testing of certain products, are located in: Kfar Saba, Israel, Dublin, Ireland and Mountain View, California. Our Dublin facility is ISO 14001, Environmental Management System, certified.
We and our contract manufacturers manufacture our products at a relatively limited number of different facilities located throughout the world and, in most cases, the manufacturing of each of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations. An interruption in manufacturing capabilities at any of these facilities, as a result of equipment failure or other reasons, could reduce, delay or prevent the production of our products. Because some of our manufacturing or our contract manufacturer’s operations are located outside of the United States, including in Ireland, China and Thailand, those manufacturing operations are also subject to additional challenges and risks associated with international operations. For these and other risks associated with our manufacturing operations, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Our R&D efforts are focused on the development of digital media content-creation, distribution and monetization tools that operate primarily on the Mac, Windows and Linux platforms. Our R&D efforts also include networking and storage initiatives intended to deliver standards-based media transfer and media asset management tools, as well as stand-alone and network-attached media storage systems for workgroups. In addition to our internal R&D efforts, we outsource a significant portion of certain R&D projects to an internationally based partner in Kiev, Ukraine. Our R&D expenditures for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $81.6 million, $95.9 million and $90.4 million, respectively, which represented 16%, 19% and 17% of our total net revenues, respectively. For the risks associated with our use of partners for R&D projects, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Our company-operated R&D operations are located in: Burlington, Massachusetts; Mountain View, California; Berkeley, California; Munich, Germany; Kaiserslautern, Germany; Kfar Saba, Israel; Szczecin, Poland; and Montreal, Canada. We also partner with a vendor in Ukraine for outsourced R&D services.

Intellectual Property
We regard our software and hardware as proprietary and protect our proprietary interests under the laws of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as through contractual provisions.
We have obtained patents and have registered copyrights, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in many foreign countries. At December 31, 2016, we held 160 U.S. patents, with expiration dates through 2035, and had 13 patent applications pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We have also registered or applied to register various trademarks and service marks in the United States and a number of foreign countries, including Avid, Avid Everywhere, Media Composer, Pro Tools and Sibelius. As a technology company, we regard our patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks and trade secrets as being among our most valuable assets, together with the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our personnel.
Our software is licensed to end users pursuant to shrink-wrap, embedded, click-through or signed license agreements. Our products generally contain features to guard against unauthorized use. Policing unauthorized use of computer software is difficult, and software piracy is a persistent problem for us, as it is for the software industry in general. Although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, trademarks, copyrights, licensing arrangements, maintaining certain technology as trade secrets and other measures, there can be no assurance that any patent, trademark, copyright or other intellectual property rights owned by us will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged, that such intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us, or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the claims, or the scope of the claims, sought by us, if at all. Others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, duplicate our technology or design around the patents that we own. In addition, effective patent, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in countries in which we do business or may do business in the future. For these and other risks associated with the protection of our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
