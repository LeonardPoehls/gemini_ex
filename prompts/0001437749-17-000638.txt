Bulova Technologies Group, Inc. ("BTGI" or the "Company") was originally incorporated in Wyoming in 1979 as “Tyrex Oil Company”. During 2007, the Company divested itself of all assets and previous operations. During 2008, the Company filed for domestication to the State of Florida, and changed its name to Bulova Technologies Group, Inc. and changed its fiscal year from June 30 to September 30. 
 
On January 1, 2009 the Company acquired the stock of 3Si Holdings, Inc. (“3Si”), a private company that was under common control and began operations in Florida.  The assets and operations of 3Si at that time were accounted for in three operating subsidiaries, BT Manufacturing Company LLC, Bulova Technologies Ordnance Systems LLC, and Bulova Technologies (Europe) LLC (formerly Bulova Technologies Combat Systems LLC). 
 
From January 1, 2009, Bulova Technologies Group, Inc. operated in multiple business segments. Government Contracting was focused on the production and procurement of military articles for the US Government and other Allied Governments throughout the world, and was accounted for through two of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries, Bulova Technologies Ordnance Systems LLC, and Bulova Technologies (Europe) LLC. In October 2012, this segment was discontinued through the sale of substantially all of the assets of Bulova Technologies Ordnance Systems LLC, with any remaining assets and liabilities associated with that operation being segregated and reported as a discontinued operation. Contract Manufacturing included the production of cable assemblies and circuit boards accounted for through BT Manufacturing Company LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary that was discontinued and disposed of in March 2011.
 
In July of 2013, the Company began the sale of high precision industrial machine tools through a distributor network accounted for through Bulova Technologies Machinery LLC, a newly formed subsidiary. 
 
In January 2016, the Company, through a newly created joint venture, BT-Twiss Transport LLC, acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Twiss Transport, Inc., Twiss Logistics, Inc. and Twiss Cold Storage, Inc. and entered into the transportation and logistics industry of freight storage and movement. The joint venture agreement provides for Bulova’s 30% ownership interest, however, Bulova is fully responsible for operational management of the acquired entities, and is liable for approximately 4.6 million of convertible debt utilized to accomplish the acquisition. Accordingly, the joint venture financial statements have been combined with those of the Company. 
 
The Company continues to evaluate the incubation and marketing of innovative technology products for which it believes it can lend value because of its highly recognizable name brand and extensive marketing experience
 
We consolidate all entities we control by ownership of a majority voting interest and variable interest entities for which we have the power to direct activities and the obligation to absorb losses. Our judgment in determining if we consolidate a variable interest entity includes assessing which party, if any, has the power and benefits. Therefore, we evaluate which activities most significantly affect the variable interest entities economic performance, and determine whether we or another party have the power to direct these activities. The following is a listing of the entities we control, and the variable interest entity we have included in our consolidated financial statements:

In October 2012, Ordnance sold substantially all of its assets to an unrelated party. The sale included the right to perform Ordnance’s then-current contracts with the Department of Defense. As a result, the only remaining work with the DoD performed by Ordnance was the nominal performance of the contracts which were transferred (until a novation of the transferred contracts was to take place) and a remaining blanket purchase agreement (BPA) with the DoD whereby the DoD could have ordered non-standard (e.g. Eastern European) weapons for shipment to friendly forces abroad. The BPA expired in October 2015. Ordnance has not sought any new contracts from the DoD since 2012.
