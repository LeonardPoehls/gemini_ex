Item 1. Description of Business.
Corporate Background
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 9, 2014 under the name LISSOME TRADE CORP.
 
We originally planned to engage in the distribution of metal cookware made from stainless steel from China to the markets of Europe and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. However, in connection with a change of control transaction that closed on August 28, 2015, we appointed a new executive management team and changed our planned business operations.
Corporate Development in Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2017


As of the date of this report, 30,722,500 shares of Common Stock and the note convertible into 150 million shares of Common Stock in connection with the Share Exchange Agreement have been returned and cancelled.
Plan of Operations
 
Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through acquisition of a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of Qingxi Meng, our Chairman, CEO, & President. Our company has flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In our efforts to analyze business opportunities, we will consider the following factors:
 

● | Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; 
● | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources; 
● | The cost of participation by our company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials; 
● | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; 
● | The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and 
● | Other relevant factors. 

 
We do not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. We intend to sell our common shares to investors to raise funds for our operating and investing cash needs. Prior to us successfully raising funds through selling our common shares, we expect our operating costs will be paid with money to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders or management. During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring costs related to filing of Exchange Act reports and consummating an acquisition.
 
We believe we will be able to meet these costs through funds to be loaned by or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors.
 
We are in the development stage and have negative working capital, negative stockholders’ equity and have not earned any revenues as of date. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are currently devoting our efforts to locating new products and acquisition candidates. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to develop additional sources of capital, locate and complete a merger with another company, and ultimately, achieve profitable operations.

Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business acquisition with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.
 
Our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business acquisition, primarily due to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective shareholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management’s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.
 
We anticipate that the process of selection of a business acquisition will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking even the limited additional capital which we will have and/or the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business acquisition may occur at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.
 
Competition
 
Our primary goal is the acquisition of a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. The Company is in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including small public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business combination.
Patent and Trademarks
 
We currently do not own any patents, trademarks or licenses of any kind.
 
Government Regulations
 
There are no government approvals necessary to conduct our current business.
 
Employees
 
We presently have no employees apart from our management. Our officers and director are engaged in outside business activities and we anticipate that they will devote to our business very limited time until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination.
