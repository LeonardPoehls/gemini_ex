ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Except where the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K the terms “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “our company” and “our business” refer to Green Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries, including our banking subsidiary; Green Bank, N.A., a national banking association, and the term “Bank” refers to Green Bank, N.A., a national banking association. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we refer to the Houston—Sugar Land—Baytown and Dallas—Fort Worth—Arlington metropolitan statistical areas as the Houston and Dallas MSAs.
Our Company
We are a Texas focused bank holding company headquartered in Houston, Texas. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Green Bank, N.A., a nationally chartered commercial bank, provides commercial and private banking services primarily to Texas based customers through twenty-two full service branches in the Houston and Dallas MSAs and other markets. The Houston and Dallas MSAs are our target markets, and we believe their growing economies and attractive demographics, together with our scalable platform, provide us with opportunities for long‑term and sustainable growth. Our emphasis is on continuing to expand our existing business by executing on our proven business model as well as pursuing select strategic acquisitions and attracting additional talented portfolio bankers. As of December 31, 2017, we had consolidated total assets of $4.3 billion, total loans held for investment of $3.2 billion (of which $2.7 billion were originated by us and $514.0 million were acquired), total deposits of $3.4 billion and total shareholders’ equity of $463.8 million.
Our stock is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “GNBC”.
Our History and Growth
We are a Texas corporation that was incorporated on October 20, 2004. We began operations as a bank holding company on December 31, 2006 when we acquired Redstone Bank, a Houston community bank with two branches and $219.3 million in total assets. We were formed by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Manny Mehos, who previously founded, led and sold Coastal Bancorp, Inc. after overseeing its growth from one branch and less than $11 million in assets in 1986 to 43 branches and $2.7 billion in assets in 2004, with the objective of building a commercially focused bank in attractive Texas metropolitan markets.
During the period from December 31, 2013 through December 31, 2017, we experienced a 24% compounded annual growth rate in total loans and a 24% compounded annual growth rate in total deposits, while extending our branch footprint from twelve to twenty-two locations and expanding our team of portfolio bankers from 48 to 63. Our scale has allowed us to leverage our infrastructure to operate our business more efficiently as evidenced by the decrease in our efficiency ratio from 64.6% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 52.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017, while our total assets grew from $1.7 billion to $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2013 and 2017, respectively.

Following our acquisition of Redstone Bank, we have supplemented our organic growth and increased our total deposits by successfully completing and integrating the following acquisitions:

• | OneWest: one branch of OneWest Bank located in the Dallas MSA with $188.4 million in total deposits, acquired in October 2010;


• | Main Street: three branches of Main Street Bank located in the Houston MSA with $167.7 million in total deposits and $12.7 million in loans, acquired in October 2011;


• | Opportunity: Opportunity Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiary, Opportunity Bank, with one branch located in the Dallas MSA, $44.1 million in total deposits and $25.6 million in total loans, acquired in May 2012;


• | SharePlus: SP Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary, SharePlus Bank (together “SharePlus”), with three branches located in the Dallas MSA and one in Louisville MSA, $270.0 million in deposits and $251.2 million in loans, acquired in October 2014; and


• | Patriot: Patriot Bancshares, Inc. (“Patriot”) and its subsidiary, Patriot Bank, with six branches located in the Houston MSA, two branches located in the Dallas MSA, and one branch located in Fannin County, Texas, $1.1 billion in deposits and $1.1 billion in loans, acquired in October 2015. 

These acquisitions have provided significant strategic benefits and opportunities, including additional quality deposits which have provided funding for our lending business, new business lines which have contributed to the expansion of our product offerings and additional branches which have extended our geographic footprint and provided opportunities for consolidation of our support areas.
We have no current plans, arrangements or understandings to make any acquisitions at this time. However, at any given time we may be evaluating other acquisition candidates, conducting due diligence and may have entered into one or more letters of intent.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to be a leading provider of personalized commercial and private banking services to Texas businesses, entrepreneurs and individuals while capitalizing on the vibrant and growing economies of our target markets. We have made the strategic decision to focus on the Houston and Dallas MSAs because we believe these markets offer a compelling combination of economic growth, favorable demographics and desirable prospective customers.
We intend to continue our strategy of growth by executing our portfolio banker driven organic growth strategy complemented by disciplined strategic acquisitions.

Portfolio Banker Growth Strategy.  We employ a portfolio banking model that relies upon experienced bankers to originate quality loans, attract and retain low cost deposits and generate fee income. Within this model, our customers are generally assigned a dedicated portfolio banker who acts as the primary point of contact and relationship manager. We believe that this model allows us to build and maintain long‑term relationships, leading to increased business opportunities and referrals, while improving our risk profile through ongoing and proactive credit monitoring and loan servicing. Our portfolio banking model has been the primary driver of our loan growth and has also helped us achieve what we believe to be a comparatively high level of average deposits per branch. Our portfolio banking model incorporates a two‑tiered incentive structure designed to compensate our portfolio bankers at a level that is commensurate with their contribution to the successful execution of our business strategy.
Our target commercial customers include Texas based small and medium‑sized businesses in the manufacturing, distribution, service and supply sectors, as well as real estate investors, mortgage originators and professional firms. We offer a wide variety of banking products and services, including loans, government guaranteed loans through the Small Business Administration and U.S. Department of Agriculture lending programs, deposit products, including demand, savings, money market and time accounts, treasury management services, an interest rate swap program and a full suite of online banking solutions. We also seek to attract traditional retail customers and to generate retail business from mass affluent individuals with the capacity to maintain significant deposit balances with us through a combination of diverse product offerings with attractive rates, convenient branch locations and personalized service.
As a significant portion of our historical growth has occurred in a low interest rate environment, a key aspect of our strategy has been the maintenance of an asset‑sensitive balance sheet that we believe will produce increased net interest income if market interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2017, 81.4% of our total loans were comprised of floating‑rate loans, which may be subject to changes in yield as the interest rate environment changes. Our loan portfolio has grown to $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2017 from $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2013, as a result of loans acquired and originated by us during that period.
Strategic Acquisitions. We intend to supplement our organic growth by executing a disciplined acquisition strategy focusing on targets with a quality loan and deposit customer base and attractive branch locations in the Texas Triangle, which is anchored by the metropolitan areas of Houston, Dallas-Forth Worth and San Antonio and includes the Austin, Bryan-College Station, Killeen-Temple-Fort Hood and Waco MSAs, that possess favorable market share, an attractive deposit mix, manageable levels of nonperforming assets and commercial real estate loan concentrations and transactions that we expect will produce attractive risk‑adjusted returns for our shareholders. We plan to leverage our reputation as an experienced acquirer of banks, recognizing many banks in our target markets face scale and operational challenges, regulatory burdens, management succession issues and/or shareholder liquidity expectations.
Acquisitions
Patriot Bancshares, Inc. - On October 1, 2015, the Company completed the merger of Patriot with and into the Company and the merger of Patriot’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Patriot Bank, with and into the Bank (collectively, the “Patriot acquisition”). Patriot, headquartered in Houston, Texas, operated six locations in Houston, two in Dallas and one in Fannin County, Texas.  As of September 30, 2015, Patriot, on a consolidated basis, reported total assets of $1.4 billion, total loans of $1.1 billion, total deposits of $1.1 billion and total shareholders’ equity of $125.2 million.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, we issued 10.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock, with a total fair value of $123.7 million based on the closing price on October 1, 2015 of $11.85 per share, for all outstanding shares of Patriot common stock, including the converted Series D and Series F preferred stock.  In addition, Patriot’s $27.3 million Series B and Series C preferred stock were redeemed in connection with the closing.  Consistent with the Company’s strategy, the primary reasons for the Patriot acquisition were to enhance market share in Houston and Dallas, and improve profitability through cost savings and revenue synergies.
In connection with the merger, we recognized $55.2 million of goodwill, $8.3 million of core deposit intangibles, and $7.3 million in net deferred tax assets.  None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths will allow us to capitalize on our substantial market opportunity and achieve our business goals:
Well‑positioned within attractive major metropolitan markets in Texas. We are one of the few Texas based banking franchises focused primarily on the major metropolitan markets in the state with a presence in both the Houston and Dallas MSAs. Substantially all of our branches are strategically located within these markets in areas that we consider to be among the most attractive in terms of serving existing and attracting new customers. We believe our model will allow us to continue to capitalize on the favorable demographic and commercial characteristics of our economically robust target markets. Within these markets, we target commercial customers with annual revenues between $5 and $150 million, and we believe that we offer customers of this size a greater level of attention than our larger competitors while providing access to a broad range of sophisticated banking products that cannot be matched by most community banks. There are numerous businesses located in the markets we serve meeting this profile and we believe that we are well‑positioned to attract these target customers relative to our competitors as a result of our extensive local knowledge, broad service offerings and portfolio banking model.
Scalable portfolio banking and operational platforms with the capacity to generate and accommodate significant organic growth. Our management team has built a capable and knowledgeable staff and made significant investments in the technology and systems necessary to build a scalable corporate infrastructure with the capacity to support continued growth, while also improving operational efficiencies. We believe that our current team has the capacity to grow loans, deposits and fee income without significant additional overhead expense. Furthermore, we believe that our scalable credit, operational, technology and governance infrastructure will continue to allow us to efficiently and effectively manage the growth driven by our strategies. For example, our efficiency ratio has decreased from 64.6% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 52.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017, while our total assets grew from $1.7 billion to $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2013 and 2017, respectively.
Disciplined and sophisticated credit governance process. Our approach to credit risk management balances well‑defined centralized credit policies, disciplined underwriting criteria, a centralized credit approval process and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes with our portfolio banking model which demands that we respond promptly to our customers’ needs. Our processes emphasize early‑stage review of loans and regular credit evaluations, which supplement the ongoing and proactive credit monitoring and loan servicing provided by our portfolio bankers. This balanced team approach has augmented our ability to identify potential problem loans early and has allowed us to maintain strong credit metrics while executing our growth strategy. In addition, we believe our nimble and responsive credit culture and underwriting process will help us to attract and retain experienced bankers who are eager to be more responsive to customers’ credit requests.
Experienced acquirer and integrator of financial institutions. We have developed a proven platform to identify acquisition candidates, conduct comprehensive due diligence, model financial expectations, and effectively consummate the transaction and integrate the acquired institution into our scalable infrastructure and achieve synergies. Since completing a successful capital raise in 2010, we have completed five M&A transactions. In addition, members of our senior management team have successfully led over 30 bank merger and acquisition transactions since the mid‑1980s, including public company transactions. There are approximately 434 banks headquartered in Texas, approximately 115 of which are headquartered in our target markets. Of these 115 banks, 34 reported total assets between $500 million and $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2017. These banks provide us with opportunities to selectively pursue strategic transactions that meet our stringent financial, cultural and risk criteria to support our continued growth. While we have no current plans, arrangements or understandings to make any acquisitions, at any given time we may be evaluating other acquisition candidates and may enter into one or more letters of intent. We cannot assure you if or when we will announce any such transaction.
Strong and experienced management team. We are managed by a team of banking executives with complementary experience and personal attributes who have a history of managing large teams, leading acquisition and divestiture projects and managing significant growth in diverse markets and economic climates. Our executive management team members are career bankers and each has over 30 years of banking experience, including significant experience within large, nationally recognized financial institutions. As a result, our executive management team has substantial expertise with numerous sophisticated banking products, extensive knowledge of the bank regulatory landscape, significant experience throughout numerous interest rate and credit cycles and a range of experience with banks of all sizes. We believe that this varied experience has resulted in a diverse and adaptive culture that enhances our ability to attract driven, entrepreneurial bankers as well as seasoned and capable credit professionals.

Segments
We manage our operations in one reportable segment. Financial information about our operations, including our revenues and net income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, and our total assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, are included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 15 “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.”
Our Banking Services
The following is a general discussion of our major types of business activities:
Lending Activities
Loan Underwriting and Approval. Historically, we have made sound, high quality loans while recognizing that lending money involves a degree of business risk. We have loan policies designed to assist us in managing this business risk. These policies provide a general framework for our loan origination, monitoring and funding activities, while recognizing that not all risks can be anticipated. Our board of directors delegates loan authority up to board‑approved hold limits collectively to our Loan Committee, which is comprised of members of our executive management team and credit risk executives. Our board of directors also delegates more limited individual lending authority to our President and Corporate Chief Credit Officer, credit risk personnel, and, on a further limited basis, to selected lending managers in each of our target markets. Lending officers and relationship managers, including our portfolio bankers, do not have individual loan authority. When the total relationship exceeds an individual’s loan authority, a higher authority or Loan Committee approval is required. The objective of the Bank’s centralized credit approval process is to provide a disciplined, collaborative approach to larger credits while maintaining responsiveness to client needs.
Loan decisions are documented as to the borrower’s business, purpose of the loan, evaluation of the repayment source and the associated risks, evaluation of collateral, covenants and monitoring requirements, and the risk rating rationale. Our strategy for approving or disapproving loans is to follow our loan policies and consistent underwriting practices which include:

• | maintaining close relationships among our customers and their designated portfolio banker to ensure ongoing credit monitoring and loan servicing;


• | granting loans on a sound and collectible basis;


• | ensuring that primary and secondary sources of repayment are adequate in relation to the amount of the loan;


• | developing and maintaining targeted levels of diversification for our loan portfolio as a whole and for loans within each category; and


• | ensuring that each loan is properly documented and that any insurance coverage requirements are satisfied.

Managing credit risk is a Company‑wide process. Our strategy for credit risk management includes well‑defined, centralized credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all commercial and consumer credit exposures. Our processes emphasize early‑stage review of loans, regular credit evaluations and management reviews of loans, which supplement the ongoing and proactive credit monitoring and loan servicing provided by our portfolio bankers. Our Corporate Chief Credit Officer provides Company‑wide credit oversight. Internal loan review periodically reviews all credit risk portfolios to ensure that the risk identification processes are functioning properly and that our credit standards are followed. In addition, a third‑party loan review is performed to identify problem assets and confirm our internal risk rating of loans. We attempt to identify potential problem loans early in an effort to seek aggressive resolution of these situations before the loans become a loss, record any necessary charge‑offs promptly and maintain adequate allowance levels for probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio.
Our loan policies generally include other underwriting guidelines for loans collateralized by real estate. These underwriting standards are designed to determine the maximum loan amount that a borrower has the capacity to repay based upon the type of collateral securing the loan and the borrower’s income. Such loan policies include maximum amortization schedules and loan terms for each category of loans collateralized by liens on real estate.
In addition, our loan policies provide guidelines for personal guarantees; environmental review; loans to employees, executive officers and directors; problem loan identification; maintenance of an adequate allowance for loan losses; and other matters relating to lending practices.
7

Lending Limits. Our lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits imposed by federal law. In general, the Bank is subject to a legal lending limit on loans to a single borrower based on the Bank’s capital level. The dollar amounts of the Bank’s lending limit increases or decreases as the Bank’s capital increases or decreases. The Bank is able to sell participations in its larger loans to other financial institutions, which allows it to manage the risk involved in these loans and to meet the lending needs of its customers requiring extensions of credit in excess of these limits.
The Bank’s legal lending limit as of December 31, 2017 on loans to a single borrower was approximately $66.6 million. However, we maintain an in‑house, board‑approved “hold” limit for loans to a single borrower. Currently, mortgage‑warehouse loans are subject to a $25.0 million hold limit and all other products and businesses are subject to a $20.0 million hold limit. We have strict policies and procedures in place for the establishment of hold limits with respect to specific products and businesses and evaluating exceptions to the hold limits for individual relationships.
Our loan policies provide general guidelines for loan‑to‑value ratios that restrict the size of loans to a maximum percentage of the value of the collateral securing the loans, which percentage varies by the type of collateral. Our internal loan‑to‑value limitations follow limits established by applicable law.
Loan Types. We provide commercial loans, commercial real estate‑backed loans, residential real estate-backed loans and personal loans to small to medium‑sized businesses, commercial companies, professionals and individuals, primarily. 
At December 31, 2017, we had total loans of $3.2 billion, representing 75.0% of our total assets. Our loan portfolio consisted of the following as of December 31, 2017:

 | Originated | | Acquired | | Total | | Percentage of Total
 | (Dollars in thousands)
Commercial & industrial | $ | 1,223,027 | | | $ | 63,469 | | $ | 1,286,496 | | 40.3 | %
Owner occupied commercial real estate | 327,906 | | | 87,324 | | | 415,230 | | 13.0 | %
Commercial real estate | 823,361 | | | 244,418 | | | 1,067,779 | | 33.5 | %
Construction, land & land development | 136,998 | | | 27,954 | | | 164,952 | | 5.2 | %
Residential mortgage | 149,021 | | | 89,559 | | | 238,580 | | 7.5 | %
Consumer and other | 16,178 | | | 1,270 | | | 17,448 | | 0.5 | %
Total loans held for investment | $ | 2,676,491 | | | $ | 513,994 | | $ | 3,190,485 | | 100.0 | %
Total loans held for sale | $ | 7,156 | | | $ | — | | $ | 7,156 | | 100.0 | %

Commercial and Industrial Loans.  We make commercial and industrial loans, including commercial lines of credit, working capital loans, mortgage‑warehouse lines, term loans, equipment financing, acquisition, expansion and development loans, borrowing base loans, government guaranteed loans, purchased receivables financing, letters of credit and other loan products, primarily in our target markets that are underwritten on the basis of the borrower’s ability to service the debt from income. Our target commercial customers include Texas based small and medium-sized businesses in the manufacturing, distribution, service and supply sectors, as well as real estate investors, mortgage originators and professional firms. 
We take as collateral a lien on general business assets including, among other things, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment and generally obtain a personal guaranty of the borrower or principal. Our commercial and industrial loans generally have variable interest rates and terms that typically range from one to five years depending on factors such as the type and size of the loan, the financial strength of the borrower/guarantor and the age, type and value of the collateral. Fixed rate commercial and industrial loan maturities are generally short‑term, with three‑to‑five year maturities, or include periodic interest rate resets. Terms greater than five years may be appropriate in some circumstances, based upon the useful life of the underlying asset being financed or if some form of credit enhancement, such as a government guarantee is obtained. As of December 31, 2017, we had $45.1 million of commercial and industrial loans due after five years, comprised of loans with government guarantees and a small number of syndicated loans and corporate borrowers. These loans had a weighted average maturity of approximately 7.58 years.
8

In general, commercial and industrial loans may involve increased credit risk and, therefore, typically yield a higher return. The increased risk in commercial and industrial loans derives from the expectation that such loans generally are serviced principally from the operations of the business, and those operations may not be successful. Any interruption or discontinuance of operating cash flows from the business, which may be influenced by events not under the control of the borrower such as economic events, catastrophic weather events and changes in governmental regulations, could materially affect the ability of the borrower to repay the loan. In addition, the collateral securing commercial and industrial loans generally includes moveable property such as equipment and inventory, which may decline in value more rapidly than we anticipate exposing us to increased credit risk. As a result of these additional complexities, variables and risks, commercial and industrial loans require extensive underwriting and servicing.
Mortgage Warehouse Loans.  As part of our commercial and industrial loan portfolio, our mortgage warehouse finance loans consist of ownership interests purchased in single-family residential mortgages funded through our warehouse lending group. These loans are typically on our balance sheet for 10 to 25 days or less. We have agreements with mortgage lenders and purchase legal ownership interests in individual loans they originate. All loans are underwritten consistent with established programs for permanent financing with financially sound investors. Substantially all loans are conforming loans or loans eligible for sale to federal agencies or government sponsored entities. However, for accounting purposes, these loans are deemed to be loans to the originator and, as such, are classified as loans held for investment. At December 31, 2017, mortgage warehouse loans totaled approximately $182.4 million, approximately 5.7% of our total funded loans.
Reserve‑based Energy Loans.  As part of our commercial and industrial loan portfolio, we have made reserve‑based energy loans to small and medium‑sized independent oil and gas producers who derive a majority of their revenues from the sale of oil and gas products and whose credit needs require a technical evaluation of oil and gas reserves.  In the fourth quarter of 2015, management made the decision to discontinue new reserve based lending to oil and gas producers and reduce our exposure to this lending sector. The primary collateral for reserve‑based loans are the borrower’s interests in oil and gas leases and related facilities, the majority of which are proven developed producing properties. Collateral is evaluated on a case‑by‑case basis by a third‑party petroleum engineer. As of December 31, 2017, we had $20.1 million of reserve‑based energy loans outstanding, approximately 0.6% of our total funded loans.
Owner Occupied and Non‑Owner Occupied Commercial Real Estate Loans.  We make commercial mortgage loans collateralized by real estate, which may be owner occupied or non‑owner occupied real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. We require our commercial real estate loans to be secured by well‑managed property with adequate margins and generally obtain a guarantee from responsible parties. Our commercial mortgage loans generally are collateralized by first liens on real estate, have variable or fixed interest rates and amortize over a 10‑to‑25 year period with balloon payments or rate adjustments due at the end of three to seven years.
Payments on loans secured by such properties are often dependent on the successful operation (in the case of owner occupied real estate) or management (in the case of non‑owner occupied real estate) of the properties. Accordingly, repayment of these loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy to a greater extent than other types of loans. In underwriting commercial real estate loans, we seek to minimize these risks in a variety of ways, including giving careful consideration to the property’s age, condition, operating history, future operating projections, current and projected market rental rates, vacancy rates, location and physical condition. The underwriting analysis also may include credit verification, reviews of appraisals, environmental hazards or reports, the borrower’s liquidity and leverage, management experience of the owners or principals, economic condition and industry trends.
Construction, Land and Land Development Loans.  We make loans to finance the construction of residential and non‑residential properties. Construction loans generally are collateralized by first liens on real estate and have floating interest rates. We conduct periodic inspections, either directly or through an agent, prior to approval of periodic draws on these loans. Underwriting guidelines similar to those described above also are used in our construction lending activities. Our construction loans generally have terms that typically range from three to five years depending on factors such as the type and size of the development and the financial strength of the borrower/guarantor and generally utilize a one to three-year interest‑only period during development/construction followed by a two‑ to five‑year period requiring amortization or in some cases principal curtailments. We offer an owner‑occupied commercial real estate loan product, which includes construction financing, with terms up to 25 years. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $28.8 million of construction, land and development loans due after five years, with a weighted average maturity of 21.51 years.
9

Construction loans generally involve additional risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of a project under construction, and the project is of uncertain value prior to its completion. Because of uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it can be difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan‑to‑value ratio. As a result of these uncertainties, construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, there is no assurance that we will be able to recover the entire unpaid portion of the loan. In addition, we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and it may be necessary to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time subject to the regulatory limitations imposed by the National Bank Act and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”).
Residential Mortgage Loans. We refer residential real estate loans primarily collateralized by owner occupied properties located in our market areas to a third-party mortgage lender.  Within this referral relationship, there are a variety of mortgage loan products which include conventional, FHA, VA, fixed and variable rate mortgages, with amortization periods up to 30 years. Typically, the mortgage vendor sells the closed mortgage loan in the secondary market. The Bank is also approved as an investor for ARM mortgage products being offered and may purchase mortgage loans to be held in the loan portfolio from these third-party mortgage lenders. Home equity loans are also being referred to the same mortgage relationship.
Consumer and Other Loans.  We make a variety of loans to individuals for personal and household purposes, including secured and unsecured term loans and home improvement loans. Consumer loans are underwritten based on the individual borrower’s income, current debt level, past credit history and the value of any available collateral. The terms of consumer loans vary considerably based upon the loan type, nature of collateral and size of the loan. Consumer loans entail greater risk than do residential real estate loans because they may be unsecured or, if secured, the value of the collateral, such as an automobile or boat, may be more difficult to assess and more likely to decrease in value than real estate. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan balance. The remaining deficiency often will not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans.
As of December 31, 2017, the aggregate amount of loans to our 10 and 25 largest borrowers (including related entities) amounted to approximately $255.0 million, or 8.0% of total loans, and $522.2 million, or 16.4% of total loans, respectively. See “Risk Factors—Risk Related to Our Business—We have a significant amount of loans outstanding to a limited number of borrowers, which may increase our risk of loss.”
Managed Asset Reduction Strategy (“MARS”). During April 2016 we initiated the Managed Asset Reduction Strategy (“MARS”) to divest our portfolio of energy loans and certain other classified assets on an accelerated basis.  We made the decision to implement MARS in order to remove uncertainty in the Company’s financial results due to the volatility in the energy cycle.  An expanded team of workout professionals who reported to our Corporate Chief Credit Officer were assigned to focus solely on the resolution of the MARS portfolio.  The MARS team took a multifaceted approach to reducing the portfolio through the use of proven management and disposition techniques, which included one or more of the following: (i) the restructure and substitution of collateral, (ii) a full refinancing by a third-party lender, (iii) a discounted pay-off by the borrower, (iv) a foreclosure and liquidation of the applicable collateral, (v) “one-off” note sales, and (vi) a portfolio sale. MARS was completed during the first quarter of 2017 after substantial reductions in energy loans and an overall reduction in nonperforming assets.
Deposit Products
Our services include the usual deposit functions of commercial banks, safe deposit facilities, commercial and personal banking services in addition to our loan offerings. Our principal source of funds is deposits. We offer a variety of deposit products and services consistent with the goal of attracting a wide variety of customers, including small to medium‑sized businesses. The types of deposit accounts consist of demand, savings, money market and time accounts. We attract deposit accounts by offering competitive rates, telephone banking, online banking and other convenient services to our customers.
We actively pursue commercial deposit accounts that will benefit from the utilization of our treasury management services. This line of business provided $561.9 million in commercial demand deposit accounts as of December 31, 2017.
10

We have developed a specialty in providing depository services to Texas-based municipal utility districts and other public entities. These deposits are generally insured time and money market deposits with some customers utilizing the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas (the “FHLB”) letters of credit to secure the uninsured portion of deposits greater than $250,000. This line of business provided $210.7 million in time and $153.9 million in money market deposit funding with $348.9 million in pledged letters of credit as of December 31, 2017.
We offer a money market account for financial institutions which generally pays a rate slightly above alternative rates available from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) Banks or correspondent banks through traditional federal funds. This product is marketed by specialty bankers specifically focused on this line of business, and provided $154.2 million in money market deposit funding as of December 31, 2017.
In addition, we provide enhanced depository services, including customized reporting, for trustees appointed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. These deposits are generally demand deposits with a portion of our securities portfolio pledged to the uninsured portion of single debtor accounts exceeding the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) insurance limits. This line of business provided $72.0 million in demand deposit funding in 1,809 separate accounts with $55.5 million in securities pledged as of December 31, 2017.
Other Products and Services
We offer banking products and services that are attractively priced and easily understood by the customer, with a focus on convenience and accessibility.

In addition, five other corporate locations are supported through our limited service concierge branches and on-site ATMs.  In addition to on-site services, we may offer, from time to time, discounted loan fees, employee relocation mortgage services, CD rate specials, Lunch and Learn financial education opportunities and other services to support the nationwide employee bases of companies participating in the Bank at Work programs. 
We are currently focused on expanding noninterest income though increased income from our treasury management services and our derivative program. We offer a full array of commercial treasury management services designed to be competitive with banks of all sizes. Treasury Management Services include balance reporting (including current day and previous day activity), transfers between accounts, wire transfer initiation, ACH origination and stop payments. Cash management deposit products consist of lockbox, remote deposit capture, positive pay, reverse positive pay, account reconciliation services, zero balance accounts and sweep accounts including loan sweep.
Our interest rate swap program has been developed as an accommodation to our customers who desire a fixed rate on loans over a certain size threshold with a defined repayment schedule. In such cases, we enter into a derivative contract with our borrower using a standard International Swaps and Derivative Association agreement and confirmation, while simultaneously entering into a “mirror” derivative contract with a correspondent bank counterparty. The two derivatives are carried at market value with changes in value offsetting.

(1)According to S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Houston. Houston ranks fourth in the nation as a home to Fortune 500 company headquarters, including Phillips 66, Sysco, ConocoPhillips, Enterprise Products Partners, and Halliburton, along with the Texas Medical Center, which is the largest health complex in the world, and benefits from a vibrant and diverse economy. The Houston MSA is the fifth largest in the country and the city of Houston is the fourth most populous city in the United States, according to 2016 U.S. Census Bureau estimates.  The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates the Houston MSA Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at $503.3 billion in 2015, making it the fourth largest U.S. metro economy. 
Dallas. Dallas ranks third in the nation as a home to Fortune 500 company headquarters, including Exxon Mobil Corp., AT&T, Energy Transfer Equity, American Airlines Group, Tenet Healthcare and Southwest Airlines. The Toyota Motor Company opened its North America headquarters in Plano in July 2017, which will employ approximately 4,000 workers.  The Dallas MSA is the seventh largest in the country and the city of Dallas is the ninth most populous city in the United States, according to 2016 U.S. Census Bureau estimates. The Dallas MSA was the largest annual percentage increase in employment among the metropolitan divisions during the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Our Portfolio Banking Model
We employ a portfolio banking model that relies upon experienced bankers to originate quality loans, attract and retain low cost deposits and generate fee income. Within this model, customers are assigned a dedicated portfolio banker who acts as the primary point of contact and relationship manager, eliminating the need to utilize a less personal call center to interact with our customers.
We have implemented a two‑tiered incentive structure designed to compensate our portfolio bankers at a level that is commensurate with their contribution to the successful execution of our business strategy. Pursuant to our Portfolio Banker Compensation Program, each eligible portfolio banker’s base salary is determined by reference to a salary matrix and net interest margin target. The salary matrix is scaled based on the size of the banker’s “portfolio,” which includes the amount of loans and weighted deposits attributable to such banker. Deposits are weighted by category according to cost with noninterest‑bearing deposits receiving maximum credit. Base salaries are subject to adjustment based on performance appraisals as well as our portfolio bankers’ management of credit risk within their portfolio.
12

Under our Portfolio Banker Incentive Program, portfolio bankers receive an incentive award based on the achievement of loan and deposit growth targets and asset quality and performance goals. Generally, the incentive award represents an uncapped share in the growth in loans and weighted deposits generated by eligible portfolio bankers during the applicable period, according to an established formula. Eligible portfolio bankers also receive a percentage of the attributable net loan origination and certain other fees received by us. Incentive awards are subject to adjustment based on performance appraisals as well as our portfolio bankers’ management of credit risk as growth objectives are pursued.
Investments
The primary objectives of our investment policy are to provide a source of liquidity, to provide an appropriate return on funds invested, to manage interest rate risk, to meet pledging requirements and to meet regulatory capital requirements.
As of December 31, 2017, the book value of our investment portfolio totaled $728.8 million, with an average yield of 2.65% and an estimated duration of approximately 4.1 years.
Our Bank board of directors and the Asset Liability Committee (“ALCO”) are responsible for the regular review of our investment activities and the review and approval of our investment policy. Day to day transactions affecting our investment securities portfolio are managed by our senior executives in accordance with the guidelines set forth in our investment policy. 
Our investment policy outlines investment type limitations, security mix parameters, authorization guidelines and risk management guidelines. The policy authorizes us to invest in a variety of investment securities, subject to various limitations. Our current investment portfolio consists of obligations of U.S. government agencies or sponsored entities, including mortgage‑backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, and smaller balances in CRA Qualified investment funds, municipal obligations and corporate debt securities.
Information Technology Systems
We have made and continue to make significant investments in our information technology systems for our banking and lending operations and treasury management activities. We believe this is a necessary investment in order to enhance our capabilities to offer new products and overall customer experience, and to provide scale for future growth and acquisitions. We outsource our core data and item processing services to a nationally recognized bank software vendor, and use the vendor’s primary system which has the capability of serving our primary data processing needs well into the future.
The majority of our other systems including our electronic funds transfer, transaction processing and our online banking services are hosted by third‑party service providers. The scalability of this infrastructure will support our growth strategy. In addition, the tested capability of these vendors to automatically switch over to standby systems should allow us to recover our systems and provide business continuity quickly in case of a disaster.
Competition
The banking business is highly competitive, and our profitability will depend principally upon our ability to compete with other banks and non‑bank financial institutions located in our market areas in Texas for lending opportunities, deposit funds, bankers and acquisition candidates. Our banking competitors in our target markets include national, regional and community banks.
We are subject to vigorous competition in all aspects of our business from banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, finance companies, credit unions and other providers of financial services, such as money market mutual funds, brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, asset‑based non‑bank lenders, insurance companies and certain other non‑financial entities, including retail stores which may maintain their own credit programs and certain governmental organizations which may offer more favorable financing than we can.
Many of the banks and other financial institutions with which we compete have greater financial strength, marketing capability and name recognition than us and operate on a statewide, regional or nationwide basis. These institutions are also likely to have legal loan limits substantially in excess of those that we maintain. Such institutions can perform certain functions for their customers, including trust, securities brokerage and international banking services, which we presently do not offer directly. Although we may offer these services through correspondent banks, the inability to provide such services directly may be a competitive disadvantage and this may affect our ability to generate business, attract experienced bankers and capitalize on acquisition opportunities.
13

We also face competition for acquisition opportunities in connection with the implementation of our acquisition strategy. Because there are a limited number of acquisition opportunities in our target markets, we face competition from other banks and financial institutions, many of which possess greater financial, human, technical and other resources than we do. Our ability to compete in acquiring target institutions will depend on our available financial resources to fund the acquisitions, including the amount of cash and cash equivalents we have and the liquidity and market price of our common stock. In addition, increased competition may also drive up the acquisition consideration that we will be required to pay in order to successfully capitalize on attractive acquisition opportunities.
In addition, recent developments in technology and mass marketing have permitted larger companies to market loans and other products and services more aggressively to our small business customers. Such advantages may enable our competitors to realize greater economies of scale and operating efficiencies than we can. Further, some of the non‑bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern the Company and the Bank. Various legislative acts in recent years have led to increased competition among financial institutions and competition from both financial and non‑financial institutions is expected to continue. See “Risk Factors—We face strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services, which could harm our business.”
We have been able to compete effectively with other financial institutions by providing a high level of personalized banking service to professionals and owner‑operated businesses and by emphasizing quick and flexible responses to customer demands; establishing long‑term customer relationships and building customer loyalty; and by offering products and services designed to address the specific needs of our customers. We rely heavily on the continued business generation of our portfolio bankers and the efforts of our officers and directors for the solicitation and referral of potential customers and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future.
Our Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 368 full time employees and no part‑time employees. None of our employees are represented by a union. Management believes that our relationship with employees is good.

Regulation and Supervision
The U.S. banking industry is highly regulated under federal and state law. These laws and regulations affect the operations of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Statutes, regulations and policies limit the activities in which we may engage and the manner in which we conduct our permitted activities. Further, the regulatory system imposes reporting and information collection obligations. We incur significant costs relating to compliance with these laws and regulations. Banking statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by federal and state legislatures and regulatory agencies, and a change in them, including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
The material statutory and regulatory requirements that are applicable to us are summarized below. The description below is not intended to summarize all laws and regulations applicable to us, and the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations, policies, interpretive letters and other written guidance that are described herein.
Bank and Bank Holding Company Regulation
The Bank is currently a national bank. As a national bank organized under the National Bank Act, the Bank is subject to ongoing and comprehensive supervision, regulation, examination and enforcement by the OCC.
Any entity that directly or indirectly controls a bank must be approved by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act to become a bank holding company (a “BHC”). BHCs are subject to regulation, inspection, examination, supervision and enforcement by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act. The Federal Reserve’s jurisdiction also extends to any company that is directly or indirectly controlled by a BHC.
The Company, which controls the Bank, became a BHC in 2006. As a BHC, the Company is subject to ongoing and comprehensive supervision, regulation, examination and enforcement by the Federal Reserve. The Company is also subject to supervision, regulation, examination and enforcement by the Texas Department of Banking.
FDIC Deposit Insurance
The FDIC is an independent federal agency that insures the deposits of federally insured depository institutions up to applicable limits. The FDIC also has certain regulatory, examination and enforcement powers with respect to FDIC‑insured institutions. The deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to applicable limits. As a general matter, the maximum deposit insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor.
Broad Supervision, Examination and Enforcement Powers
A principal objective of the U.S. bank regulatory system is to protect depositors by ensuring the financial safety and soundness of banking organizations. To that end, the banking regulators have broad regulatory, examination and enforcement authority. The regulators regularly examine the operations of banking organizations. In addition, banking organizations are subject to periodic reporting requirements.
The regulators have various remedies available if they determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of a banking organization’s operations are unsatisfactory. The regulators may also take action if they determine that the banking organization or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation. The regulators have the power to, among other things:
•    enjoin “unsafe or unsound” practices;
•    require affirmative actions to correct any violation or practice;
•    issue administrative orders that can be judicially enforced;
•    direct increases in capital;
•    direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets;
•    limit dividends and distributions;
15

•    restrict growth;
•    assess civil monetary penalties;
•    remove officers and directors; and
•    terminate deposit insurance.
The FDIC may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency. Engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or failing to comply with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the Company, and subsidiaries of the Company or their officers, directors and institution‑affiliated parties to the remedies described above and other sanctions.
The Dodd‑Frank Act
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd‑Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd‑Frank Act is having a broad impact on the financial services industry, and imposes significant regulatory and compliance requirements, including the designation of certain financial companies as systemically important financial companies, the changing roles of credit rating agencies, the imposition of increased capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements, and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthen safety and soundness within, the financial services sector. Additionally, the Dodd‑Frank Act establishes a new framework of authority to conduct systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC.
The following items provide a brief description of certain provisions of the Dodd‑Frank Act that are most relevant to the Company and the Bank.

• | Source of strength. The Dodd‑Frank Act requires all companies, including BHCs, that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution to serve as a source of strength for the institution. Under this requirement, the Company in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank should it experience financial distress. 


• | Limitation on federal preemption. The Dodd‑Frank Act significantly reduces the ability of national banks to rely on federal preemption of state consumer financial laws. Although the OCC, as the primary regulator of national banks, will have the ability to make preemption determinations where certain conditions are met, the broad rollback of federal preemption has the potential to create a patchwork of federal and state compliance obligations. This could, in turn, result in significant new regulatory requirements applicable to the Bank, with potentially significant changes in our operations and increases in our compliance costs. It could also result in uncertainty concerning compliance, with attendant regulatory and litigation risks. 


• | Mortgage loan origination and risk retention. The Dodd‑Frank Act imposes new standards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders, including banking organizations, in an effort to require steps to verify a borrower’s ability to repay. In addition, the Dodd‑Frank Act generally requires lenders or securitizers to retain an economic interest in the credit risk relating to loans the lender sells or mortgage and other asset‑backed securities that the securitizer issues. On January 10, 2013, federal regulators released the “qualified mortgage” rule. The qualified mortgage rule is intended to clarify the application of the Dodd‑Frank Act requirement that mortgage lenders have a reasonable belief that borrowers can afford their mortgages, or the lender may not be able to foreclose on the mortgage. 

16

On August 28, 2013, the OCC, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the SEC, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development issued a proposed rule in connection with the risk retention requirement mandated by Section 941 of the Dodd‑Frank Act. The final rules implementing the risk retention requirements of Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective on February 23, 2015.  The risk retention requirement generally requires a securitizer to retain no less than 5% of the credit risk in assets it sells into a securitization and prohibits a securitizer from directly or indirectly hedging or otherwise transferring the credit risk that the securitizer is required to retain, subject to limited exemptions. One significant exemption is for securities entirely collateralized by “qualified residential mortgages” (“QRMs”), which are loans deemed to have a lower risk of default. The rule defines QRMs to have the same meaning as the term “qualified mortgage,” as defined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). In addition, the rule provides for reduced risk retention requirements for qualifying commercial loan, commercial real estate loan and auto loan securitizations.

• | Imposition of restrictions on certain activities. The Dodd‑Frank Act imposes a new regulatory structure on the over‑the‑counter derivatives market, including requirements for clearing, exchange trading, capital, margin, reporting and record keeping. In addition, certain swaps and other derivatives activities are required to be “pushed out” of insured depository institutions and conducted in separately capitalized non‑bank affiliates. The Dodd‑Frank Act also requires certain persons to register as a “major swap participant,” “swap dealer,” “major security‑based swap participant” or a “security‑based swap dealer.” The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has substantially completed adopting regulations to implement much of the new derivatives regulatory structure of the Dodd‑Frank Act. The SEC and other U.S. regulators are still in the process of adopting regulations to implement the new derivatives regulatory structure of the Dodd‑Frank Act. With regard to security‑based swaps, it is anticipated that this further rulemaking will further clarify, among other things, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, margin and capital requirements, the scope of registration requirements and the types of swaps that are required to be centrally cleared and exchange‑traded. Rules will also be issued to enhance the oversight of clearing and trading entities. As these remaining rules are implemented, new restrictions or limitations may affect our ability to manage certain risks in our business. 


• | Expanded FDIC resolution authority. While insured depository institutions have long been subject to the FDIC’s resolution process, the Dodd‑Frank Act creates a new mechanism for the FDIC to conduct the orderly liquidation of certain “covered financial companies,” including bank and thrift holding companies and systemically significant non‑bank financial companies. Upon certain findings being made, the FDIC may be appointed receiver for a covered financial company, and would conduct an orderly liquidation of the entity. The FDIC liquidation process is modeled on the existing FDIA and generally gives the FDIC more discretion than in the traditional bankruptcy context. The FDIC has issued final rules implementing the orderly liquidation authority. 


• | Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd‑Frank Act created a new, independent CFPB. The CFPB is tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing products and services offered to bank and thrift consumers. For banking organizations with assets of $10 billion or more, the CFPB has exclusive rule making and examination, and primary enforcement authority under federal consumer financial laws. In addition, the Dodd‑Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB. Compliance with any such new regulations would increase our cost of operations. 


• | Deposit insurance. The Dodd‑Frank Act made permanent the general $250,000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits. Amendments to the FDIA also revised the assessment base against which an insured depository institution’s deposit insurance premiums paid to the DIF of the FDIC will be calculated. Under the amendments, the assessment base is no longer the institution’s deposit base, but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. Additionally, the Dodd‑Frank Act made changes to the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits, and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. Several of these provisions may impact the FDIC deposit insurance premiums paid by the Bank. 

17


• | Transactions with affiliates and insiders. The Dodd‑Frank Act generally enhanced the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and clarification regarding the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied. Insider transaction limitations are expanded through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to the various limits, including derivatives transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending or borrowing transactions. Restrictions are also placed on certain asset sales to and from an insider to an institution, including requirements that such sales be on market terms and, in certain circumstances, approved by the institution’s board of directors. 


• | Enhanced lending limits. The Dodd‑Frank Act strengthens the existing limits on a depository institution’s credit exposure to one borrower. On June 25, 2013, the OCC published a final rule amending its existing lending limits to incorporate changes made by the Dodd‑Frank Act. The Dodd‑Frank Act and the final rule amend the OCC’s lending limit regulation to include credit exposures arising from derivative transactions and repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions and securities borrowing transactions. The final rule exempts certain types of transactions, and outlines the methods that banks can choose from to measure credit exposures of derivative transactions and securities financing transactions. In most cases, a bank may choose which method it will use; the OCC, however, may specify that a bank use a particular method for safety and soundness reasons. 


• | Corporate governance. The Dodd‑Frank Act addresses many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies, including the Company. The Dodd‑Frank Act (1) grants shareholders of U.S. publicly traded companies an advisory vote on executive compensation; (2) enhances independence requirements for compensation committee members; (3) requires companies listed on national securities exchanges to adopt incentive‑based compensation clawback policies for executive officers and (4) provides the SEC with authority to adopt proxy access rules that would allow shareholders of publicly traded companies to nominate candidates for election as a director and have those nominees included in a company’s proxy materials. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of the provisions of the JOBS Act allowing us to not seek a non‑binding advisory vote on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. 

The requirements of the Dodd‑Frank Act are in the process of being implemented over time and most will be subject to regulations implemented over the course of several years. Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd‑Frank Act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on our operations is unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd‑Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require certain changes to our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements.
In February 2017, the U.S. President issued an executive order that (i) stated his administration's core principles and policies for regulating the U.S. financial system and (ii) directed specified regulatory agencies to review and identify laws and regulations that inhibit federal regulation of the U.S. financial system in a manner consistent with the principles stated in the executive order. Changes in laws or regulations as a result of this review could result in the amendment of or delayed implementation of certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
Failure to comply with the new requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
The Volcker Rule
The Dodd-Frank Act amends the BHC Act to require the federal financial regulatory agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain hedge funds and private equity funds.  Since neither the Company nor the Bank engages in the types of trading or investing covered by the Volker Rule, the Volcker Rule does not currently have any effect on the operations of the Company or the Bank. 
18

Notice and Approval Requirements Related to Control
Banking laws impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an FDIC‑insured depository institution. These laws include the BHC Act, the Change in Bank Control Act and the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act. Among other things, these laws require regulatory filings by a shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an FDIC‑insured depository institution. The determination whether an investor “controls” a depository institution is based on all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the investment. As a general matter, a party is deemed to control a depository institution or other company if the party owns or controls 25% or more of any class of voting stock. Subject to rebuttal, a party may be presumed to control a depository institution or other company if the investor owns or controls 10% or more of any class of voting stock. Ownership by affiliated parties, or parties acting in concert, is typically aggregated for these purposes. If a party’s ownership of the Company were to exceed certain thresholds, the investor could be deemed to “control” the Company for regulatory purposes. This could subject the investor to regulatory filings or other regulatory consequences.
In addition, except under limited circumstances, BHCs are prohibited from acquiring, without prior approval:
•    control of any other bank or BHC or all or substantially all the assets thereof; or
•    more than 5% of the voting shares of a bank or BHC which is not already a subsidiary.
Permissible Activities and Investments
Banking laws generally restrict the ability of the Company from engaging in, or acquiring 5% or more of the voting shares of a company engaged in, activities other than those determined by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. The Gramm‑Leach‑Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (the “GLB Act”) expanded the scope of permissible activities for a BHC that qualifies as a financial holding company. Under the regulations implementing the GLB Act, a financial holding company may engage in additional activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to a financial activity. Those activities include, among other activities, certain insurance and securities activities. Qualifications for becoming a financial holding company include, among other things, meeting certain specified capital standards and achieving certain management ratings in examinations. Under the Dodd‑Frank Act, BHCs and their subsidiaries must be well‑capitalized and well‑managed in order for the BHC and its nonbank affiliates to engage in the expanded financial activities permissible only for a financial holding company.
In addition, as a general matter, the establishment or acquisition by the Company of a depository institution or, in certain cases, a non‑bank entity, requires prior regulatory approval.
Regulatory Capital Requirements and Capital Adequacy
The federal bank regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution’s financial soundness. As a general matter, national banks and their holding companies are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold. The final supervisory determination on an institution’s capital adequacy is based on the regulator’s assessment of numerous factors.
As a BHC and a national bank, the Company and the Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements.
The Federal Reserve has established risk‑based and leverage capital guidelines for BHCs, including the Company. The OCC has established substantially similar risk‑based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to national banks, including the Bank. The risk‑based capital guidelines in effect as of December 31, 2014, commonly referred to as “Basel I,” were based upon the 1988 capital accord of the International Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel Committee”), a committee of central banks and bank supervisors, as implemented by the U.S. federal banking agencies. The federal banking agencies subsequently adopted separate risk‑based capital guidelines for so‑called “core banks” based upon the Revised Framework for the International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards (“Basel II”) issued by the Basel Committee in November 2005. The revised comprehensive capital framework referred to as “Basel III” became effective January 1, 2015.  Prior to January 1, 2015 the Basel I Capital Rules applied to the Company and the Bank.
19

Basel I.   Under Basel I, the minimum ratio of total capital to risk‑weighted assets (which are primarily the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain off‑balance sheet items such as standby letters of credit) was 8%. At least half of total capital must have been composed of tier 1 capital, which includes common shareholders’ equity (including retained earnings), qualifying non‑cumulative perpetual preferred stock (and, for BHCs only, a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of trust preferred securities), and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill, other disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets, among other items. The Federal Reserve also has adopted a minimum leverage ratio requiring tier 1 capital of at least 4.0% of average quarterly total consolidated assets (as defined for regulatory purposes), net of goodwill and certain other intangible assets for all but the most highly rated BHCs.
The federal banking agencies have also established risk‑based and leverage capital guidelines that FDIC‑insured depository institutions are required to meet. These regulations are generally similar to those established by the Federal Reserve for bank holding companies.
Basel II.  Under the final U.S. Basel II rules issued by the federal banking agencies, there are a small number of “core” banking organizations that are required to use the advanced approaches under Basel II for calculating risk‑based capital related to credit risk and operational risk, instead of the methodology reflected in the regulations effective prior to adoption of Basel II. The rules also require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles, and to publicly disclose certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy. The Company and the Bank are not among the core banking organizations required to use Basel II advanced approaches.
Basel III.  On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation, known as Basel III. The Basel III calibration and phase‑in arrangements were previously endorsed by the Seoul G20 Leaders Summit in November 2010, and are subject to individual adoption by member nations, including the United States. Under these standards, when fully phased‑in on January 1, 2019, banking institutions will be required to satisfy three risk‑based capital ratios:

i. | A common equity tier 1 ratio of at least 7.0%, inclusive of 4.5% minimum common equity tier 1 ratio, net of regulatory deductions, and the new 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” of common equity to risk‑weighted assets;


ii. | A tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8.5%, inclusive of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer; and


iii. | A total capital ratio of at least 10.5%, inclusive of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer.

US Implementation of Basel III.  In July 2013, the federal banking agencies published final rules (the “Basel III Capital Rules”) that revised their risk‑based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk‑weighted assets to implement, in part, agreements reached by the Basel Committee and certain provisions of the Dodd‑Frank Act. The rules implemented the Basel Committee’s December 2010 framework known as “Basel III” for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Capital Rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions, including the Company and the Bank, under the previous U.S. risk-based capital rules. The Basel III Capital Rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Capital Rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing risk-weighting approach, which was derived from the Basel I capital accords of the Basel Committee, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the standardized approach in the Basel Committee’s 2004 “Basel II” capital accords. The Basel III Capital Rules also implemented the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies’ rules. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015, subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions.  While some provisions are tailored to larger institutions, the Basel III Capital Rules generally apply to all banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank.
Among other things, the Basel III Capital Rules: (i) include a new capital measure entitled “Common Equity Tier 1” (“CET1”); (ii) specify that tier 1 capital consist of CET1 and additional financial instruments satisfying specified requirements that permit inclusion in tier 1 capital; (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions or adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions or adjustments from capital as compared to the existing regulations.
20

The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Under the previous capital standards, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital were excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded; however, non-advanced approach banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. The Company and the Bank made this election in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale securities portfolio. The Basel III Capital Rules also preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, as Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies, subject to phase-out.
The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a “countercyclical capital buffer” that is applicable to only certain covered institutions and does not have any current applicability to the Company or the Bank.
The aforementioned capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.
Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a four-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and increasing by an additional 20% per year thereafter). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and is being phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019).
The Basel III Capital Rules also provide a permanent exemption from the proposed phase out of existing trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock from regulatory capital for banking organizations with less than $15 billion in total assets, while also implementing stricter eligibility requirements for regulatory capital instruments that should serve to disallow the inclusion of all non‑exempt issuances of trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock from tier 1 capital. The Basel III Capital Rules also provide additional constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage servicing assets, deferred tax assets and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in tier 1 capital, as well as providing stricter risk weighting rules to these assets.
The Basel III Capital Rules provide for the following minimum capital to risk‑weighted assets ratios:

i. | 4.5% based upon CET1;


ii. | 6.0% based upon tier 1 capital; and


iii. | 8.0% based upon total regulatory capital.

A minimum leverage ratio (tier 1 capital as a percentage of total assets) of 4.0% is also required under the Basel III Capital Rules. The Basel III Capital Rules additionally require institutions to retain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above these required minimum capital ratio levels. Banking organizations that fail to maintain the minimum 2.5% capital conservation buffer could face restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, with distributions and discretionary bonus payments being completely prohibited if no capital conservation buffer exists, or in the event of the following: (i) the banking organization’s capital conservation buffer was below 2.5% at the beginning of a quarter and (ii) its cumulative net income for the most recent quarterly period plus the preceding four calendar quarters is less than its cumulative capital distributions (as well as associated tax effects not already reflected in net income) during the same measurement period.
21

When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules will require the Company to maintain (1) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0% upon full implementation), (2) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation), (3) a minimum ratio of Total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation) and (4) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average quarterly assets.
The Basel III Capital Rules also provide stricter rules related to the risk weighting of past due and certain commercial real estate loans, as well as on some equity investment exposures, and replaces the existing credit rating approach for determining the risk weighting of securitization exposures with an alternative approach.
Finally, the Basel III Capital Rules amend the thresholds under the “prompt corrective action” framework enforced with respect to the Bank by the OCC to reflect both (i) the generally heightened requirements for regulatory capital ratios as well as (ii) the introduction of the CET1 capital measure, as discussed below under “Prompt Corrective Action.”
The Basel III Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the previous four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. In addition, the Basel III Capital Rules provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation.
The federal banking agencies’ risk-based and leverage capital ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria. Banking organizations not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios. The federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant. Federal Reserve Board guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets.
The enactment of the Basel III Capital Rules increased the required capital levels that the Company and the Bank must maintain. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective as applied to the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015, with a phase in period from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2019.
Liquidity Coverage Ratio.  The Basel III Capital Rules adopted in July 2013 did not address the proposed liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”) called for by the Basel Committee’s Basel III framework. On October 24, 2013, the Federal Reserve issued a proposed rule implementing a LCR requirement in the United States for larger banking organizations. Neither the Company nor the Bank would be subject to the LCR requirement as proposed.
Prompt Corrective Action
Under the FDIA, the federal bank regulatory agencies must take “prompt corrective action” against undercapitalized U.S. depository institutions. U.S. depository institutions are assigned one of five capital categories: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized,” and are subjected to different regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls.

• | A bank is “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or higher; a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or higher (not applicable prior to January 1, 2015); a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or higher (6.0% prior to January 1, 2015); a leverage ratio of 5.0% or higher; and is not subject to any written agreement, order or directive requiring it to maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.


• | A bank is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or higher; a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or higher (not applicable prior to January 1, 2015); a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or higher (4.0% prior to January 1, 2015); a leverage ratio of 4.0% or higher; and does not meet the criteria for a “well capitalized” bank.

22


• | A bank is “under capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%; a CET1 capital ratio less than 4.5% (not applicable prior to January 1, 2015); a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0% (4.0% prior to January 1, 2015) or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%.


• | A bank is “significantly under capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%; a CET1 capital ratio less than 3.0% (not applicable prior to January 1, 2015); a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% (3.0% prior to January 1, 2015) or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%.


• | A bank is “critically under capitalized” if it has tangible equity equal to or less than 2.0% of average quarterly tangible assets.

At December 31, 2017, the Bank was classified as “well-capitalized” for purposes of the FDIC’s prompt corrective action regulations in effect as of such date.
Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the institution to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies, including: termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, restrictions on certain business activities and appointment of the FDIC as conservator or receiver.  Under certain circumstances, a well‑capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category. A banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan. The capital restoration plan will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company having control of the undercapitalized institution guarantees the subsidiary’s compliance with the capital restoration plan up to a certain specified amount.
As noted above, the Basel III Capital Rules amend the thresholds under the “prompt corrective action” framework enforced with respect to the Bank by the OCC to reflect both (i) the generally heightened requirements for regulatory capital ratios as well as (ii) the introduction of the CET1 capital measure.
Regulatory Limits on Dividends and Distributions
Federal law currently imposes limitations upon certain capital distributions by national banks, such as certain cash dividends, payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares, payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash‑out merger and other distributions charged against capital. The Federal Reserve and OCC regulate all capital distributions by the Bank directly or indirectly to the Company, including dividend payments.
For example, under applicable regulations, the Bank must file an application for OCC approval of a capital distribution if the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the Bank’s net income for that year to date plus the Bank’s retained net income for the preceding two years. Additionally, the Bank may not pay dividends to the Company if, after paying those dividends, it would fail to meet the required minimum levels under risk‑based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage and tangible capital ratio requirements, or in the event the OCC notified the Bank that it was in need of more than normal supervision. Under the FDIA, an insured depository institution such as the Bank is prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become “undercapitalized.” Payment of dividends by the Bank also may be restricted at any time at the discretion of the appropriate regulator if it deems the payment to constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice.
In addition, the Bank may become subject to supervisory limits on its ability to declare or pay a dividend or reduce its capital unless certain conditions are satisfied.
Reserve Requirements
Pursuant to regulations of the Federal Reserve, all banking organizations are required to maintain average daily reserves at mandated ratios against their transaction accounts. In addition, reserves must be maintained on certain non‑personal time deposits. These reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in an account at a Federal Reserve Bank.
23

Limits on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders
Insured depository institutions are subject to restrictions on their ability to conduct transactions with affiliates and other related parties. Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act imposes quantitative limits, qualitative requirements and collateral requirements on certain transactions by an insured depository institution with, or for the benefit of, its affiliates. Transactions covered by Section 23A include loans, extensions of credit, investment in securities issued by an affiliate and acquisitions of assets from an affiliate. Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act requires that most types of transactions by an insured depository institution with, or for the benefit of, an affiliate be on terms at least as favorable to the insured depository institution as if the transaction were conducted with an unaffiliated third‑party.
As noted above, the Dodd‑Frank Act generally enhances the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and a clarification regarding the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied. The ability of the Federal Reserve to grant exemptions from these restrictions is also narrowed by the Dodd‑Frank Act, including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators.
The Federal Reserve’s Regulation O and OCC regulations impose restrictions and procedural requirements in connection with the extension of credit by an insured depository institution to directors, executive officers, principal shareholders and their related interests.
Brokered Deposits
The FDIA restricts the use of brokered deposits by certain depository institutions. Under the applicable regulations, (i) a “well capitalized insured depository institution” may solicit and accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit without restriction, (ii) an “adequately capitalized insured depository institution” may not accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless it has applied for and been granted a waiver of this prohibition by the FDIC and (iii) an “undercapitalized insured depository institution” may not accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit. The FDIC may, on a case‑by‑case basis and upon application by an adequately capitalized insured depository institution, waive the restriction on brokered deposits upon a finding that the acceptance of brokered deposits does not constitute an unsafe or unsound practice with respect to such institution.
Concentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Guidance
The federal banking agencies, including the OCC, have promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100% or more of total capital or (ii) total reported loans secured by multifamily and non‑farm residential properties and loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 300% or more of total capital and the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. Owner occupied commercial real estate loans are excluded from this second category. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address the following key elements: including board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending.
Examination Fees
The OCC currently charges fees to recover the costs of examining national banks, processing applications and other filings, and covering direct and indirect expenses in regulating national banks. The Dodd‑Frank Act provides various agencies with the authority to assess additional supervision fees.
Deposit Insurance Assessments
FDIC‑insured depository institutions are required to pay deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC. The amount of a particular institution’s deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution’s risk classification under an FDIC risk‑based assessment system. An institution’s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to the regulators. Deposit insurance assessments fund the DIF. As noted above, the Dodd‑Frank Act changed the way an insured depository institution’s deposit insurance premiums are calculated. These changes may impact assessment rates, which could impact the profitability of our operations.
24

Depositor Preference
The FDIA provides that, in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If we invest in or acquire an insured depository institution that fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non‑deposit creditors, including us, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.
Anti‑Money Laundering and OFAC
Under federal law, financial institutions must maintain anti‑money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing employee training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit function. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and customer identification in their dealings with non‑U.S. financial institutions and non‑U.S. customers. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions, and law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and they must consider an institution’s compliance with such obligations in connection with the regulatory review of applications, including applications for banking mergers and acquisitions. The regulatory authorities have imposed “cease and desist” orders and civil money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations.
The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s (“U.S. Treasury Department”) Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC publishes lists of persons, organizations and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. If the Company or the Bank finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, the Company or the Bank must freeze or block such account or transaction, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities.
Consumer Laws and Regulations
Banking organizations are subject to numerous laws and regulations intended to protect consumers. These laws include, among others:

• | Truth in Lending Act;


• | Truth in Savings Act;


• | Electronic Funds Transfer Act;


• | Expedited Funds Availability Act;


• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act;


• | Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act;


• | Fair Housing Act;


• | Fair Credit Reporting Act;


• | Fair Debt Collection Act;


• | GLB Act;


• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act;


• | Right to Financial Privacy Act;


• | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act;


• | laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices; and


• | usury laws.

25

Many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous, and in addition to, those listed above. These federal, state and local laws regulate the manner in which financial institutions deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans or conducting other types of transactions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could give rise to regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by state and local attorneys general and civil or criminal liability. The creation of the CFPB by the Dodd‑Frank Act has led to enhanced enforcement of consumer financial protection laws.
The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”)
The CRA is intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas, including low and moderate‑income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. The bank regulators examine and assign each bank a public CRA rating. The CRA then requires bank regulators to take into account the federally insured bank’s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering an application by a bank to establish or relocate a branch or to conduct certain mergers or acquisitions. The Federal Reserve is required to consider the CRA records of a BHC’s controlled banks when considering an application by the BHC to acquire a banking organization or to merge with another BHC. When the Company or the Bank applies for regulatory approval to engage in certain transactions, the regulators will consider the CRA record of the target institution and our depository institution subsidiaries. An unsatisfactory CRA record could substantially delay approval or result in denial of an application. The regulatory agency’s assessment of the institution’s record is made available to the public. Following its most recent CRA examination in July 2016, the Bank received an overall rating of “Satisfactory.”
Changes in Laws, Regulations or Policies
Federal, state and local legislators and regulators regularly introduce measures or take actions that would modify the regulatory requirements applicable to banks, their holding companies and other financial institutions. Changes in laws, regulations or regulatory policies could adversely affect the operating environment for the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways, increase our cost of doing business, impose new restrictions on the way in which we conduct our operations or add significant operational constraints that might impair our profitability. We cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Effect on Economic Environment
The policies of regulatory authorities, including the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, have a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Among the means available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits.
Federal Reserve monetary policies have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the business and earnings of the Company and its subsidiaries cannot be predicted.
