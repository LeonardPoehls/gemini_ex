ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
Retail Properties of America, Inc. is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and operates high quality, strategically located shopping centers in the United States. As of December 31, 2017, we owned 112 retail operating properties representing 20,265,000 square feet of gross leasable area (GLA). Our retail operating portfolio includes (i) neighborhood and community centers, (ii) power centers, and (iii) lifestyle centers and multi-tenant retail-focused mixed-use properties, as well as single-user retail properties.

In addition to our operating portfolio, as of December 31, 2017, we owned two properties that were in active redevelopment and one property where we have begun activities in anticipation of future redevelopment.
Operating History
We are a Maryland corporation formed in March 2003 and have been publicly held and subject to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting requirements since 2003. We were initially formed as Inland Western Retail Real Estate Trust, Inc. and on March 8, 2012, we changed our name to Retail Properties of America, Inc.
Business Objectives and Strategies
In 2012, management began transforming our portfolio in an effort to focus the portfolio on high quality, multi-tenant retail properties. The core objective of this effort was to become a prominent owner of multi-tenant retail properties primarily located in certain markets. We believe that a geographically focused portfolio allows us to optimize our operating platform and enhance our operating performance. The markets we identified include: Dallas, Washington, D.C./Baltimore, New York, Chicago, Seattle, Atlanta, Houston, San Antonio, Phoenix and Austin, which generally feature one or more of the following characteristics:

• | well-diversified local economy;


• | strong demographic profile with significant long-term population growth or above-average existing density, high disposable income and/or a highly educated employment base;


• | fiscal and regulatory environment conducive to business activity and growth;


• | strong barriers to entry, whether topographical, regulatory or density driven; and

1


• | ability to create critical mass and realize operational efficiencies.

Since the beginning of 2012, we have sold 206 properties for aggregate consideration of $3,214,763, including our pro rata share of unconsolidated joint ventures and three development properties, with a majority of the proceeds used for the acquisition of high quality, multi-tenant retail assets, debt reduction and repurchases of our common stock. Since we began executing on our external growth initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2013, we have purchased 33 properties for aggregate consideration of $1,590,647, including our pro rata share of unconsolidated joint ventures. As a result of these efforts, we have strengthened our portfolio and balance sheet and have geographically focused our portfolio, with approximately 84% of our multi-tenant retail annualized base rent (ABR) as of December 31, 2017 in the top 25 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), as determined by the United States Census Bureau and ranked based on the most recently available population estimates. Subject to favorable market conditions, among other factors, we expect to effectively complete our portfolio transformation in early 2018 and moving forward, we expect to maximize value through mixed-use redevelopment, leasing and opportunistic, accretive property recycling.
Competition
In seeking new investment opportunities, we compete with other real estate investors, including other REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, foreign investors, real estate partnerships, private equity funds, private individuals and other real estate companies.
From an operational perspective, we compete with other property owners on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, location, visibility, quality and aesthetic value of construction, and strength and name recognition of tenants. These factors combine to determine the level of occupancy and rental rates that we are able to achieve at our properties. Because our revenue potential may be linked to the success of retailers, we indirectly share exposure to the same competitive factors that our retail tenants experience when trying to attract customers. These factors include other forms of retailing, including e-commerce and direct consumer sales, and general competition from other regional shopping centers. To remain competitive, we evaluate all of the factors affecting our centers and work to position them accordingly. We believe the principal factors that retailers consider in making their leasing decisions include:

• | consumer demographics;


• | quality, design and location of properties;


• | diversity of retailers within individual shopping centers;


• | management and operational expertise of the landlord; and


• | rental rates.

Based on these factors, we believe that the size and scope of our property portfolio and operating platform, as well as the overall quality and attractiveness of our individual properties, enable us to compete effectively for retail tenants. We believe that our geographically-focused strategy enhances our ability to drive revenue growth by more thoroughly understanding the local market dynamics and by increasing our market relevancy.
Tax Status
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on the taxable income we distribute to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the generally applicable corporate tax rate. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income, property or net worth and U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. We have one wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary that has jointly elected to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A TRS is taxed on its net income at the generally applicable corporate tax rate. The income tax expense incurred through the TRS has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Regulation
General
The properties in our portfolio, including common areas, are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations.
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
Our properties must comply with Title III of the ADA to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to allow access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe our existing properties are substantially in compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to incur significant capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information regarding compliance with the ADA.
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or release of hazardous substances, waste, or petroleum products at, on, in, under or from such property, including costs for investigation, remediation, natural resource damages or third party liability for personal injury or property damage. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or release of such materials, and the liability may be joint and several.
Independent environmental consultants conducted Phase I Environmental Site Assessments or similar environmental audits for all of our investment properties. A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment is a written report that identifies existing or potential environmental conditions associated with a particular property. These environmental site assessments generally involve a review of records and visual inspection of the property, but do not include soil sampling or ground water analysis. These environmental site assessments have not revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our operations. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information regarding environmental matters.
Insurance
We carry comprehensive liability and property insurance coverage inclusive of fire, extended coverage, earthquakes, terrorism and loss of income insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio under a blanket policy. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. We believe that the properties in our portfolio are adequately insured. Terrorism insurance is carried on all properties in an amount and with deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information. The terrorism insurance is subject to exclusions for loss or damage caused by nuclear substances, pollutants, contaminants and biological and chemical weapons. Insurance coverage is not provided for losses attributable to riots or certain acts of God.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 220 employees.

Recent Tax Legislation
The recently enacted H.R. 1, informally titled as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (TCJA), generally applicable for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, made significant changes to the Code, including a number of provisions of the Code that affect the taxation of businesses and their owners, including REITs and their shareholders, and, in certain cases, that modify the tax rules.
Among other changes, the TCJA made the following changes:

• | for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, (i) the U.S. federal income tax rates on ordinary income of individuals, trusts and estates have been generally reduced and (ii) non-corporate taxpayers are permitted to take a deduction for certain pass-through business income, including dividends received from REITs that are not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income, subject to certain limitations;


• | the maximum withholding rate on distributions by us to non-U.S. shareholders that are treated as attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest is reduced from 35% to 21%;


• | a U.S tax-exempt shareholder that is subject to tax on its unrelated business taxable income (UBTI) will be required to separately compute its taxable income and loss for each unrelated trade or business activity for purposes of determining its UBTI;


• | the maximum U.S. federal income tax rate for corporations has been reduced from 35% to 21% and the corporate alternative minimum tax has been eliminated, which would generally reduce the amount of U.S. federal income tax payable by any taxable REIT subsidiary (TRS) that we own or form and by us to the extent we were subject to corporate U.S. federal income tax (for example, if we distributed less than 100% of our taxable income or recognized built-in gains in assets acquired from C corporations);


• | certain new limitations on net operating losses now apply; such limitations may affect net operating losses generated by us or any TRS that we own or form;


• | new limitations on the deductibility of interest expense may apply, including a new limitation on the deductibility of net business interest expense of up to 30% of our adjusted taxable income, and such limitations may affect the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by us or any TRS that we own or form. At the taxpayer’s election, the 30% of adjustable taxable income limitation does not apply to business interest of a real property trade or business (RPTOB). If the RPTOB election is made, it is irrevocable and the alternative depreciation system (ADS) must be used for non-residential real property, residential rental property and qualified improvement property held by the taxpayer;


• | there is no change to the depreciable lives for non-residential property (remains at 40 years). It appears Congress intended to (i) reduce the ADS recovery period of qualified improvement property to 20 years (generally previously 39 years) and (ii) provide 100% bonus depreciation for qualified improvement property expenditures through 2022 (with such bonus depreciation being phased down beginning in 2023 through 2026), but it also appears that unless Congress passes technical corrections to the TCJA, such reduced ADS recovery period and 100% bonus depreciation property will not be available. In addition, bonus depreciation is not applicable for the class lives required to use ADS (such as when the RPTOB election is made). The changes to depreciable lives and bonus depreciation may impact our depreciation deduction;


• | generally starting with compensation paid in 2018, Code Section 162(m) will limit the deduction of compensation, including performance-based compensation, in excess of $1,000 paid to anyone who serves as the principal executive officer or chief financial officer, or who is among the three most highly compensated executive officers for any taxable year. This change expanded the limitation to include the principal financial officer and continues after separation of service. Therefore, there may be an increase in the amount of compensation we provide to our executive officers that may not be deductible; and


• | the timing of recognition of certain income items for U.S. federal income tax purposes has changed to generally require us to recognize income items no later than when we take the item into account for financial statement purposes, which may accelerate our recognition of certain income items.

This summary does not purport to be a detailed discussion of the changes to U.S. federal income tax laws as a result of the enactment of the TCJA. Technical corrections or other amendments to the TCJA or administrative guidance interpreting the TCJA may be forthcoming at any time. We cannot predict the long-term effect of the TCJA or any future law changes on REITs or their shareholders. Shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of the TCJA based on their particular circumstances.

Taxation of Non-U.S. Holders of Debt Securities
For debt securities held by a non-U.S. debt holder that is not an individual, the IRS Form W-8BEN has been replaced by the IRS Form W-8BEN-E. Further, the IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (as applicable) is generally effective for the remainder of the year of signature plus three full calendar years unless a change in circumstances renders any information on the form incorrect and is effective beyond such three calendar years only if, in addition to the absence of any change in circumstances makes any information on the form incorrect, the non-U.S. debt holder satisfies certain requirements specified in the applicable Treasury regulations.
