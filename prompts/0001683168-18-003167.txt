With our participation in online and offline platforms, we hope to improve the payment landscape in Malaysia, connecting people across emerging markets. We seek to revolutionize the way business works by providing cutting-edge payment solutions, security, internet & mobile technologies and integrating with conventional business practices to mitigate the constraints of distance and time for maximum convenience and speed.
 
HISTORY
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 25, 2007. Prior to our acquisition of MIG Mobile Tech Berhad (“MMT”), a corporation organized under the laws of Malaysia, we were an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. We were also a “shell company” with no meaningful assets or operations other than our efforts to identify and merge with an operating company. We operated under the name “Contact Minerals Corp. and our securities traded under the symbol “CNTM.” Effective November 6, 2017, we changed our name to “WECONNECT Tech International, Inc.” and our symbol to “WECT.” Our business office is located at 1st Floor, Block A, Axis Business Campus, No. 13A & 13B, Jalan 225, Section 51A, 46100 Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia. Effective June 8, 2018, we consummated the acquisition of 49,831,007 shares of MMT (the “MMT Shares”), constituting approximately 99.662% of the issued and outstanding securities of MMT. As a result of our acquisition of the MMT Shares, we ventured into the payment solution business with a focus on users located in Malaysia.
 
Effective August 29, 2017, the Company and Kerry McCullagh, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary and Treasurer (the “Seller”) entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Shiong Han Wee and Kwueh Lin Wong (collectively, the “Purchasers”). Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Purchasers agreed to purchase 7,000,000 shares from the Seller (the Seller Shares”) and 78,770,000 shares from the Company (the “Issued Shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $350,000. The sale of the Seller Shares and the Issued Shares consummated September 11, 2017.
 
Upon the consummation of the sale, Kerry McCullagh, Alex Langer and William McCullagh, our former executive officers and directors, resigned from all of their positions with the Company. Their resignations were not due to any dispute or disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices.
 
The following individuals were appointed to serve in the positions set forth next to their names below:
 

Name | Age | Position 
---------------+-----+------------------------------------------------
Shiong Han Wee | 41 | Director, Chief Executive Officer 
Kwueh Lin Wong | 41 | Director, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary

 
Chee Kuen Chim and Pui Hold Ho were each appointed to serve as a Director of the Company effective September 22, 2017. Mr. Chim resigned from his positions with the Company effective May 11, 2018, and Mun Wai Wong was appointed to fill the vacancy caused by such resignation on June 1, 2018.
 
Effective June 1, 2018, Kwueh Lin Wong resigned from his position as the Chief Financial Officer of the Company and Chow Wing Loke was appointed to fill the vacancy caused by Mr. Wong’s resignation.
 
Effective June 8, 2018, we consummated the acquisition of 49,831,007 shares of MMT (the “MMT Shares”), constituting approximately 99.662% of the issued and outstanding securities of MMT. As consideration, we agreed to issue to the MMT shareholders 498,310,070 shares of our common stock, at a value of US $0.05 per share, for an aggregate value of US$24,915,503.50. As a result of our acquisition of the MMT Shares, we entered into the payment solution business with a focus on users located in Malaysia.

GLOBAL E-COMMERCE & DIGITAL PAYMENT MARKET 
 
Global
 
According to ResearchAndMarkets.com, the digital payment market is estimated to be USD 38.00 billion in 2018 and is projected to reach USD 86.76 billion by 2023 – at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 18.0% during the forecast period. Major factors driving the growth of the digital payment market include initiatives undertaken for the promotion of digital payments, the high proliferation of smartphones, and the need to provide improved customer service at POS terminals. On the other hand, lack of global standards for cross-border payments is a key factor expected to restrain the growth of the digital payment market.
 
Based on organization size, the SMEs segment of the digital payment market is projected to grow at a higher CAGR from 2018 to 2023 as compared to the large enterprise segment. Governments of countries across the globe have launched various initiatives to promote the adoption of new technologies in SMEs. In addition, they have also reduced the Merchant Discount Rate (“MDR”) for SMEs to facilitate large-scale deployment of digital payment solutions. As a result, SMEs in countries such as India, Australia, China, and Germany are increasingly adopting digital payment solutions to improve business outcomes. 
 
The digital payment market in the Asia Pacific region is projected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. This growth was attributed to the increased demand for digital payment solutions and advancements in digital technologies benefitting all stakeholders in the digital payment ecosystem in the Asia Pacific region.
 
ASEAN Market
 
The rapid spread of e-commerce may help keep Southeast Asia’s economic prospects strong. This digital revolution was aided by the efforts of many innovators and entrepreneurs seeking to drive a regional strategy across ASEAN, which includes Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Social media, the growing reach of e-commerce platforms, and investments in logistical infrastructure are helping to connect buyers with sellers across Southeast Asia.
 
As a result, e-commerce is projected to grow explosively by 36% per year through 2025 and is also projected to account for 6.4% of retail sales in ASEAN by 2025, compared with less than 1% today. This projected positive growth will create enormous new opportunities for ASEAN companies to reach the region’s middle-class and affluent consumers, whose ranks are projected to reach 400 million by 2020.

With the rapid growth and embrace of digital technologies, we believe that an increasing number of consumers will be ready to welcome more payment options. As Malaysian society slowly goes cashless, we expect e-commerce platforms to introduce new and creative payment methods to meet the changing needs of consumers. At WECT, we want to contribute to the economic growth and technological advancement by introducing creative payment solutions.

Current - WECONNECT 1.0
 
WECONNECT 1.0 is our mobile payment platform designed to consolidate users’ payment needs and connect merchants to consumers in a dynamic ecosystem via digital transactions in the form of mobile payment. The launch of WECONNECT 1.0 enabled us to gather users’ feedbacks in Malaysia to drive the development of WECONNECT 2.0.

Under Development - WECONNECT 2.0 
 
We are currently developing WECONNECT 2.0 based upon feedbacks received from the launch of WECONNECT 1.0. We expect WECONNECT 2.0 to serve as our upgraded platform that will support a dynamic ecosystem of technology services that we believe may influence how commerce takes place, covering both online and offline channels, via digital transactions that are both convenient and rewarding.

v | WECONNECT Technology
--+---------------------

 
We believe that payment systems in the ASEAN region face the following common market challenges:
 

· | Unreliable 3G/4G network of digital connectivity by telecommunication service providers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ever-shifting of the legislative and compliance structures which are restrictive;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Existing ecosystem of legacy payment system;
--+---------------------------------------------


· | Security and data privacy issues and identity fraud; and/or
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | Non-unified payment network which is confusing and costly.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

 
To address these market challenges, we have developed the core of our WECONNECT 2.0 platform using BLOCKCHAIN technology. Why Blockchain – because of TRUST:
 

1. | Transparency 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Public decentralized ledger of transactions, allowing the respective party to easily verify the legitimacy of each record.


2. | Reputation 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Peer to peer protocols are increasingly becoming a means to set an additional layer of trust based on an individual’s reputation or scoring system.


3. | Unalterable 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | The immutable nature of the blockchain renders it the most robust and trustworthy decentralized network.


4. | Smart Contracts 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | A digitally agreed upon terms of a contract that underpins the trust between two parties while executing an agreement without involving 3rd parties, yet using lines of code.


5. | Token Economy 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Token or new cryptocurrencies are used to fuel the blockchain network designed to solve real use cases, increase liquidity and trust amongst its members without a central authority.

We are working to develop a base structure that will harness on 5th Generation Blockchain Technology which will allow seamless plugin of existing legacy systems in the market. It will enable WECONNECT 2.0 to be capable of processing more than 1 million tps (transaction per second). The improved WECONNECT 2.0 will make possible any payment through Fiat currencies, Cryptocurrencies, cards network, and biometrics, facial recognition, iris recognition for IT security protocols which would put us as the leader in the payment solution that is seamless, trustless, borderless and instant.

v | WECONNECT Revenue Streams
--+--------------------------

 
We expect WECONNECT 2.0 to generate revenue from the following streams:
 
Marketing: WECONNECT 2.0 will be capable of providing a platform-wide marketing campaign for both B2B and B2C segments. We will employ the Geo Fencing and target marketing feature to pull more consumers or potential consumers to our merchants. We will also employ push and pull marketing strategies to our merchants.
Advertisement: WECONNECT 2.0 will be a cost-effective advertising platform for G2C, B2B and B2C. Voucher, promotions and advertisement will be available for both B2B and B2C marketplaces.
 
OPERATIONS
 
Our business operations are divided into the following core functions to address the needs of our unique business model centered around our merchants and customers.
 
Service Representatives: Our service representatives team focuses on expanding the merchant base of WECONNECT, as well as addressing all the needs of our customers. They will work with the Tech Development team to improve the customer experience on the website and mobile applications based on customer feedback. Our services representative team will also actively initiate communications with prospective merchants through various business engagements, ranging from introduction of the WECONNECT tools and plan for the digital ecosystem. Our representatives will work closely with the merchant before and after any of their product goes live on the app, as well as assist them to review their transaction progress and performance. We also offer several merchant tools to help merchants manage their products. These tools are accessible through an online account that is personal to the merchant and can be accessed through a mobile platform. As of July 31, 2018, we employed 14 services representatives.
Technology: We embrace and welcome new technologies to improve the WECONNECT user experience for both our subscribers and merchants. We aim to increase the user rate of our subscribers and enhance the efficiency of our business operations. To continue expanding our business model, we will continue to develop and refine our technology.
 
Our information technology team is focused on the design and development of new features and products, maintenance of our websites and development and maintenance of our internal operations systems.
 
In addition, we use our technology and scale to target relevant products based on individual user preferences. As we increase the volume of transactions through our marketplace, we increase the amount of data that we have about deal performance and customer interests. This data allows us to continue to improve our ability to help merchants design the most effective deals and deliver deals to customers that match their interests. Increased relevancy enables us to offer the best products, which we believe will result in increasing purchases by targeted subscribers, thereby driving greater demand. We monitor the relevancy of products by measuring purchasing rates among targeted subscribers.
 
Merchant Scale and Quality: We draw on the experience we have gained to evaluate prospective merchants based on quality, location and relevance to our subscribers. We maintain a large base of prospective merchants interested in our marketplace, which enables us to be more selective and offer our subscribers higher quality products. Increasing our merchant base also increases the number and the variety of deals that we are able to offer to consumers. We believe this will drive higher user traffic, and in turn promotes greater merchant interest in offering attractive deals through our marketplace.

Brand: Our vision is to create a trusted brand by delivering a compelling value proposition to our merchants and customers backed by our unique digital eco-system platform. Substantial portion of our subscribers are acquired through word-of-mouth, which we consider valuable users other than those acquired from a paid-for link to our website. We believe our brand is trusted due to our dedication to our customers and our significant investment in customer satisfaction. We believe that trust in our brand is evidenced by our repeat customers and the scale of our merchant pool.
 
To fund our expansion and operation in the next 18 months, we will require an approximate USD2,850,000 to implement our business plan. For the immediate future, we intend to finance our business expansion efforts through sales of our securities to existing shareholders and loans from existing shareholders or financial institutions.
 
DISTRIBUTION
 
We market our deals directly through several platforms: mobile applications, social platforms and various business partners to display and promote WECONNECT deals or cross-collaborations.
 

· | Mobile Applications: Consumers access our products through our mobile platform, which is available at no additional cost on the iOS and Android mobile operating systems.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Social Platforms: We promote our products and deals on our various social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Consumers will be able to view our offerings by scrolling down the screen, without being required to open an app.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Business Partners: We actively seek business/brand partnerships to cross-promote our brand, products, services, deals or even events.

OUR STRATEGY
 
Our objective is to become an essential part of everyday local commerce for consumers and merchants. Key elements of our strategy include the following:
 
A Single Ecosystem: We believe our WECONNECT platform is unique in the way that the platform connects businesses and consumers through technology in more than one way with just a few steps. In addition to online shopping, we also offer cashless interactions between merchants and users. Through our platform, businesses will be able to better target certain customers and consumers will be able to purchase products by using their mobile phones or walking into a store without their wallets. We believe that products offering a combination of online and brick and mortar cashless shopping interactions are currently not prevalent in our markets.
Omnipresence: We believe that our products will help offline and online businesses mitigate experimental marketing or wasting marketing dollars to “find out what works for them”. We believe that our platform will help businesses better target their customers by:

· | Increasing online and offline visibility through online user reviews of participating businesses;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Providing key user and product performance data to allow businesses to refine their offerings and target users; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increasing customer retention by offering convenient online and offline shopping experience and increased security through the use of vouchers in lieu of cash or credit cards.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Based on this, we believe our merchants will consider the profitability of the immediate deal, potential revenue generated by repeat customers and increased brand awareness and the resulting revenue stream that brand awareness may generate over time. We believe that some merchants may view our platform as a low-cost marketing expense and may be willing to offer products with little or no immediate profitability in an effort to gain future customers and increased brand awareness.
 
Helping businesses adapt to the digital age: We are extremely dedicated to helping our merchants reach their full potential and gain as much exposure as possible. Technology has changed shopping and the way we spend our money so radically that many traditional businesses struggle to keep up. Owners of offline businesses will now be able to bring their products to an online market without needing to create their own platform, thanks to WECONNECT. We strive to make the platform as accessible as possible for both merchants and users because we understand that not everyone has an easy understanding of digital-age selling.
 
Security and convenience: Because the mode of payments reduces cash interactions, we believe that we help users mitigate fraud and security issues. All purchases and interactions are done through pre-purchased vouchers, making the entire process safer and offering our users peace-of-mind. We understand the security concerns faced by many people today and are always seeking new and innovative ways to ensure the safety of our users and merchants.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENTS
 
We expect to rely on patents, trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, trademarks, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our “WeConnect” brand and services. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.
 
The laws of Malaysia and our target countries may not protect our brand and services and intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws, if at all. We may be unable to fully protect our intellectual property rights in these countries. Further, companies in the internet, social media technology and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.
 




8
-

 

We intend to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets through a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and patents, if applicable. We anticipate that the form of protection will vary depending upon the level of protection afforded by the particular jurisdiction. Initially, we expect that our revenue will be derived principally from our operations in Malaysia where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. In such instances, we may seek protection of our intellectual property through measures taken to increase the confidentiality of our findings.
 
We intend to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our companies and products. We intend to protect our trademarks against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate.
 
We rely on trade secrets and unpatentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. We expect that, where applicable, we will require our employees to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment with us. We expect these agreements to provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances. The agreements will also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as the exclusive property of our company. There can be no assurance, however, that all persons who we desire to sign such agreements will sign, or if they do, that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or unpatentable know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.
 
COMPETITION
 
We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry that is sensitive to price and service. We compete with leading e-commerce companies such as iPay88, PayPal, MOLPay and Alibaba (which offers Alipay) which may offer substantially the same or similar product offerings as us. We also compete with businesses that focus on particular merchant categories or markets. We also compete with traditional cash payments and other popular online shopping websites and apps, and other traditional media companies that provide discounts on products and services. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:

· | Breadth of subscriber base and merchants featured;
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | Local presence and understanding of local business trends;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | Ability to deliver a high volume of relevant deals to consumers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ability to produce high purchase rates for deals among subscribers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ability to generate a positive return on investment for merchants; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strength and recognition of our brand.
--+---------------------------------------

 
Although we believe we compete favorably on the factors described above, we anticipate that larger, more established companies may directly compete with us as we continue to demonstrate the viability of a local one-stop payment solution provider. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, larger product and services offerings, larger customer base and greater brand recognition. These factors may allow our competitors to benefit from their existing customer or subscriber base with lower acquisition costs or to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies, which may allow them to build a larger subscriber base or to monetize that subscriber base more effectively than us. Our competitors may develop products or services that are similar to our products and services or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services. In addition, although we do not believe that merchant payment terms are a principal competitive factor in our market, they may become such a factor and we may be unable to compete fairly on such terms.
