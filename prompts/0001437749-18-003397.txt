Item 1. Business
Overview 
 
We are a global, high-growth diagnostics company focused on developing and commercializing proprietary tests for underserved immune-regulated conditions. Our focus is on four areas: infectious diseases transplantation, autoimmune and inflammatory disease and immune-oncology. We believe these areas are particularly attractive because they involve large patient populations and chronic conditions that present the opportunity for both initial diagnosis and additional testing to monitor the conditions. These immune-regulated conditions also tend to be characterized by wide variation in presentation and progression and often require expensive therapies, making diagnostic tests that can better categorize patients and inform treatment pathways particularly useful and cost-effective. Lastly, we believe these conditions to be underserved as the industry lacks the appropriate techniques to prosecute the immune responses which are driving these conditions.
 
Our first product is our proprietary T-SPOT®1.TB test, which is used to test for tuberculosis, or TB, infection and leverages our T-SPOT technology platform, which allows us to measure the response of specific immune cells to inform the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of patients with immune-regulated conditions. Our T-SPOT.TB test has been approved for sale in over 50 countries, including the United States, where we have received premarket approval, or PMA, from the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in Europe, where we have obtained a CE mark, as well as in Japan and China. Interferon-gamma release assays, or IGRAs, such as our T-SPOT.TB test have been included in clinical guidelines for TB testing in over 30 countries, including the United States, several European countries and Japan. In addition, we have established reimbursement for our test in the United States, as well as a Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT 2, code that is unique to our test. Outside the United States, we have established reimbursement in several countries where reimbursement applies, including Japan, Switzerland, Germany, France and South Korea. We have also established the cost-effectiveness of our test in several published studies. 
 
Our second product line is a range of assays for tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme disease. Tick-borne disease is the collective name for diseases passed to humans through the bite of an infected tick. The most prevalent and well known tick-borne disease is Lyme disease, but there are others such as anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, and babesiosis. If left unrecognised, and therefore untreated, they may go on to cause significant complications, including in rare cases death. Our tick-borne disease tests utilize molecular methods (such as polymerase chain reaction) and techniques to prosecute the immune system, and are widely reimbursed in the U.S. using existing codes on fee schedules. Our tests include multiple laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, which utilize unique methodologies offered from our Clinical and Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, certified and College of American Pathologists, or CAP, accredited laboratory in Massachusetts and an FDA cleared test kit utilizing the C6 peptide, which is a marker specific to Lyme disease. Our C6 Lyme ELISATM kit is also CE marked in the European Union. 
 
Our third product line is a series of assays for use in screening blood for the parasite Babesia microti which causes babesiosis. Babesiosis is a tick-borne disease characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that range from asymptomatic to severe acute or even fatal illness. The disease is generally mild to moderate in children and young healthy adults, but it is more severe in neonates, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals such as those undergoing treatment for cancer. While it is primarily transmitted through a tick bite, babesiosis can also be transmitted by blood transfusion. In fact, transfusion-transmitted babesiosis is responsible for the highest percentage (31%) of transfusion-related infectious fatalities reported to the FDA in transfusion recipients and Babesia microti is the highest ranking pathogen in the U.S. transmitted by blood transfusion for which no licensed donor screening is available. The transmission risk of Babesia microti is comparable to the transmission risk of HIV, HBV, and HCV prior to the implementation of routine blood screening programs for these pathogens. Screening of blood products for Babesia microti, therefore, has become a priority for the FDA. We are developing three assays for use in screening the U.S. blood supply for Babesia microti. We have submitted biologics license applications, or BLAs, for these three assays and they are currently under review by the FDA.
 
Our T-SPOT.CMV test is a part of our fourth product line focused on the transplantation market. The test utilizes our T-SPOT technology platform and is an LDT performed in our CLIA certified, CAP accredited laboratory in Tennessee. The T-SPOT.CMV test is also CE marked as a kit in the European Union. The T-SPOT.CMV test measures the strength of a patient’s cellular immune response to antigens specific to cytomegalovirus, or CMV, and provides information that may be useful in informing management strategies of patients at risk of CMV infection and disease, such as transplant patients. We continue to take a measured approach to market introduction of this test as we await final results of our two pivotal clinical studies involving this test.

Product development activities are inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain regulatory body clearance to market our products, including our blood donor screening assays, and delays in obtaining regulatory clearance may allow for increased competition, thereby potentially impacting the successful commercialization of our products. In addition, we may terminate our development efforts with respect to one or more of our products under development at any time, including before or during clinical trials, based upon changed market conditions.
 
We believe the annual global market opportunity for our T-SPOT.TB test is well in excess of $1 billion, assuming we can largely displace the tuberculin skin test, or TST, in the developed world. We believe the market opportunity for our tests directed to Lyme and other tick-borne diseases exceeds $400 million. We have not yet sized the market opportunity for our transplantation and blood screening assays, as the volume of sales and pricing remain unknown.
 
We are a global business with 457 employees, including sales and marketing teams on three continents, and laboratories in the United States and the United Kingdom. In 2017, we derived approximately 38% of our revenue from outside the United States and our current customer base includes more than 3,000 active customers, such as hospitals, public health departments, physician offices, commercial testing laboratories, importers and distributors.
 
Our focus
 
Our focus is to develop and commercialize proprietary assays for under-served immune-regulated conditions by leveraging the technological, product development, manufacturing, quality, regulatory and sales and marketing capabilities we have developed over our fifteen year history. Large populations of patients have immune-regulated conditions that are often chronic conditions requiring active management through monitoring. Testing that allows better categorization of patients and yields insights into the most likely successful treatment path facilitates personalized medicine, directing therapies to patients in whom they are more likely to work and saving healthcare dollars. We view this space as being underserved by traditional diagnostic companies which lack appropriate techniques to prosecute the immune system.
 
Understanding immune-regulated conditions requires interrogation of the immune system. The human immune system is composed of two principal branches: cellular (T cell) immunity and humoral (B cell and antibody-based) immunity. Through our T-SPOT technology platform we can efficiently measure marker-specific T cell responses at a single cell level and thereby inform the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of patients with immune-regulated conditions. We employ a quantitative method to detect antigen-specific cells releasing immune messenger molecules, called cytokines, released by effector T cells. In relation to effector T cells, our technology is designed to selectively measure responses from this subtype of T cells because they are primarily present when active, replicating pathogens are inside the body, as opposed to other T cell subtypes that may be present long after an infection has been cleared from the body. For diagnosis and monitoring applications, it is more relevant to be able to measure the immune response associated with the current infection rather than the immune response associated only with past, cleared exposure.

Our T-SPOT technology offers many technical advantages that make it well suited to support our focus on immune-regulated conditions including high analytical sensitivity, application across multiple diseases and conditions and standardization of white blood cell counts, which makes our technology particularly useful in immunocompromised patients, such as those undergoing transplant surgery or immunosuppressive therapy. We employ proprietary manufacturing processes and protocols designed to cost-effectively and reliably produce key elements of our T-SPOT technology, including the process for coating microtiter plates with cytokine antibodies, such as IFN-y antibodies, and our quality control testing procedures. Further, we have developed proprietary methods designed to achieve rapid throughput in assay performance across our product lines. These methods involve specific protocols throughout the assay process and have been developed in our service and research and development laboratories.
 
Our assays directed to tick-borne diseases include differentiated tests that provide increased insight into antibody responses to tick-borne pathogens, which may help clinicians understand the disease state more completely. Our C6 Lyme test kit employs a patented synthetic peptide derived from a protein that is highly specific for Lyme disease. 
 
In addition to our technologies, we have a number of capabilities that we believe we can leverage in developing and commercializing products. We operate both kit and service offerings, giving us go to market flexibility. We have a proven track record of running multi-center clinical trials, changing guidelines and establishing reimbursement, capabilities that are important to commercial success of diagnostic products. We have the experience and capability to gain regulatory clearance to manufacture and sell products meeting the regulatory requirements of numerous countries around the world. This, combined with our global sales and marketing infrastructure, allows us to generate revenues in a large number of countries. 
 
Our Commercial Products and Late-Stage Product Pipeline
 
Tuberculosis
 
Tuberculosis is a common and, if not properly treated, potentially lethal infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or MTB. MTB typically infects the lungs, but the lymph nodes, kidneys, brain and bones may also be infected. Those with latent tuberculosis infection, or LTBI, are asymptomatic and are not infectious; however, each person with LTBI has a 5% to 10% chance, on average, of progressing to active TB over his or her lifetime. This risk of progression to active TB is significantly elevated among individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, or diabetes or those on drugs that suppress the immune system (e.g., those taking biologic therapies for autoimmune disease or those undergoing immune suppression post-transplantation). Without proper treatment, up to two thirds of individuals with active TB disease will die. 
 
 2


According to the World Health Organization, or WHO, approximately one-third of the world’s population, over two billion people, is infected with M. tuberculosis. Despite the availability of an effective treatment, TB is the leading cause of infectious disease death worldwide and remains one of the top ten causes of death worldwide from any cause. The WHO estimated that in 2016 approximately 10 million people were diagnosed with active TB disease, of which approximately 1.7 million people died. 
 
There are three broad strategies to control TB: vaccination, finding and treating active TB disease, and finding and treating LTBI to prevent the development of new active TB disease cases. The United States has one of the most comprehensive LTBI screening programs in the world with screening of several high-risk groups, including healthcare workers, recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC. Screening of healthcare workers is also recommended as part of the accreditation standards for U.S. hospitals. Other high-risk groups identified by CDC include persons with immunosuppressive conditions, such as persons receiving immunosuppressive agents or organ transplant recipients, and persons with human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. In addition, TB screening is required in many cases for additional populations, such as day care staff, school teachers and students, and emergency response personnel. 
 
In total, we estimate that there are approximately 22 million LTBI tests performed each year in the United States, the majority of which are performed within the healthcare system in a variety of settings, including hospitals, public health offices, physicians’ offices and clinics. Outside the United States, we estimate the total number of tests to be approximately 28 million each year, for a combined market size of approximately 50 million LTBI tests annually. 
 
The primary test currently used for TB screening is the more than 100-year-old TST. The TST is administered by injecting an extract from cultured M. tuberculosis, called tuberculin or PPD, into the skin of a subject’s forearm using a needle and syringe. The injection of the PPD into the skin of a subject previously infected with MTB stimulates the immune response, including T cells, causing the formation of a hard lump at the site of the injection. Because it takes time for this reaction to occur, the subject must return 48 to 72 hours after the PPD injection to have the result read. The test result is graded by feeling for the boundaries of the swelling, marking these with a pen and then measuring the diameter with a ruler. 
 
The TST suffers from several limitations, including an antiquated technique that results in substantial test variability, false negative results in immunocompromised patients, false positive results in patients who have been Bacille Calmette-Geurin, or BCG, vaccinated and boosting of results, which occurs when an infected subject’s reaction to an initially false-negative TST causes increased sensitivity in a subsequent test such that it tests positive. In addition to these technical drawbacks, the TST requires multiple patient visits, which increases its overall cost.
 
Our T-SPOT.TB test addresses the limitations of the TST by directly measuring antigen-specific T cells indicative of TB infection. We use two TB-specific antigens, ESAT-6 and CFP10, to stimulate T cells that have previously been exposed to M. tuberculosis, which causes them to release a cytokine called interferon-gamma. Interferon-gamma is one of the dominant cytokines released by activated T cells when encountering M. tuberculosis. In contrast to the PPD reagent used in the TST, these two antigens are not shared with the BCG vaccine or with most non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Because our test detects individual T cells via their release of interferon-gamma, our test is sometimes referred to generically as an IGRA. 
 
We currently offer our T-SPOT.TB test in either an in vitro diagnostic kit or a service format. In the former, we sell test kits and associated accessories to laboratories for them to perform the testing themselves. In the latter, we have established clinical testing laboratories in the United States and the United Kingdom, where we perform our T-SPOT.TB test on samples sent to us by customers. In these markets, we have found that many customers prefer to send samples to us rather than perform their own analysis on-site. We market our service offering under the name Oxford Diagnostic Laboratories®, or ODL®.
 
Our test is widely reimbursed both internationally, with reimbursement established in Japan, Switzerland, Germany, France and South Korea, and in the U.S., where we have established a unique CPT code for our test. Based upon the combination of public and private payors, we have over 300 million covered lives in the U.S.
 
We believe that clinical guidelines, which are recommendations issued by national medical societies or public health bodies, are a driving factor in a clinician’s decision to use a specific diagnostic test. IGRAs, such as our T-SPOT.TB test have been included in clinical guidelines for TB testing in over 30 countries, including the United States, several European countries and Japan.
 
In recent years, the use of IGRAs has been increasingly recommended. For example, in December 2016, a publication titled “Official American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Clinical Practice Guidelines: Diagnosis of Tuberculosis in Adults and Children” recommended use of IGRAs for testing for TB infection instead of the TST for patients over the age of five who meet the following criteria: 1) are likely to be infected with MTB, 2) have a low or intermediate risk of disease progression, 3) testing for LTBI is warranted, and 4) either have a history of BCG vaccination or are unlikely to return for a second visit to read the TST. 
 
 3


We believe that these guidelines, and similar national guidelines outside the United States, allow us to access the vast majority of the current TST market and assert the superiority of an IGRA in significant segments of the market.
 
We currently market our T-SPOT.TB test directly in the United States, Northern Europe and Japan. Outside of these territories, we have contracted with distributors who market and sell our test. In countries where we have a direct presence, we use a combination of sales managers, sales representatives, customer service staff and technical experts to interact with clinicians, nurses, administrative staff, laboratories and other groups who are involved in the implementation of TB screening programs. Our goal is to educate these groups about the clinical, operational and economic benefits of switching from the TST to our T-SPOT.TB test. Our customer service staff and technical experts are also involved in the practical training of customers to perform and order our T-SPOT.TB test as well as providing ongoing customer support. In addition to these teams, we offer a diverse array of marketing programs and services, which include advertising, medical education, attendance at scientific meetings and other awareness-raising activities. 
 
In 2017, we derived approximately 83% of our revenue from sales of our T-SPOT.TB test.
 
Tick-borne diseases
 
Tick-borne diseases is the collective name for diseases passed to humans through the bite of an infected tick. As reported by the CDC, the most common tick-borne disease in the United States is Lyme disease, and it is estimated that over 300,000 people are diagnosed with the disease each year. Other tick-borne diseases include Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, babesiosis, erlichiosis, anaplasmosis, Powassan disease, tick-borne relapsing fever and tularemia. According to data maintained by CDC, the incidence of all tick-borne diseases has increased steadily each year and the number of reported cases of Lyme disease more than doubled from 2001 through 2016.
 
The symptoms of tick-borne diseases often overlap, making diagnosis a challenge without accurate tests that can differentiate between the causative agents of disease. The CDC recommended approach for diagnosis of Lyme disease involves a 2-tier testing methodology that relies on detection of antibodies. While these guidelines are effective in many situations, this 2-tier testing algorithm has limitations, especially during the first few weeks of infection. Furthermore, the CDC guidelines for Lyme disease testing do not require testing for other tick-borne infections, meaning that such infections may be missed. 
 
Tests, or combinations of tests, that allow for more timely and accurate detection of tick-borne infections other than Lyme disease are a primary unmet need in this market. Our portfolio of tick-born disease tests addresses this need by covering a wide range of tick-borne diseases, including babesiosis, erlichiosis and anaplasmosis. Our tests also aim to address the separate unmet need for tests that have higher sensitivity in early presentations of Lyme disease. We use a variety of methods, including antibody capture, enzyme immunoassay, or EIA, western blot, polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, and immunofluorescence assay, or IFA, to detect serological and molecular evidence of the particular organisms associated with tick-borne disease. 
 
We also maintain a tick-borne disease database of specimens with serological evidence of infection. This database allows us to run a comparative analysis of current and past samples to provide further information to clinicians about their patients and disease state. Our database also enables us to analyze co-infection data and tailor test combinations to the tick-borne diseases most prevalent in particular geographies. 
 
In 2017, our Massachusetts laboratory began offering an assay targeting Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, or RMSF. RMSF is the most lethal and most frequently reported rickettsial tick-borne diseases in the United States. Although RMSF cases have been reported throughout most of the contiguous United States, five states (North Carolina, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Missouri) account for over 60% of RMSF cases. The early clinical presentation of RMSF is nonspecific and may resemble a variety of other infectious and non-infectious diseases. Our offering can be used to identify RMSF infection as well as other rickettsial diseases. 
 
In addition to our service offerings, our C6 Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme) ELISA kit, or C6 Lyme ELISA kit, measures Lyme specific antibodies by leveraging a synthetic version of the C6 peptide antigen, a marker specific to Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative organism of Lyme disease in the U.S. We currently utilize our sales force to market our tick-borne disease tests directly in the U.S. Outside the U.S., we rely on our direct sales force as well as independent distributors to market our C6 Lyme ELISA kit.
 
Babesia microti Blood Screening
 
Babesiosis is a tick-borne disease characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that range from asymptomatic to severe acute or even fatal illness. While the disease is generally mild to moderate in children and young healthy adults, it is more severe in neonates, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals such as those undergoing treatment for cancer.  Babesiosis is predominately caused by a parasite called Babesia microti. While it is primarily transmitted through a tick bite, babesiosis can also be transmitted by blood transfusion. Transfusion-transmitted babesiosis is responsible for the highest percentage (31%) of transfusion-related infectious fatalities over the past ten years (2006 – 2015) reported to the FDA in transfusion recipients and Babesia microti is the highest ranking pathogen in the U.S. transmitted by blood transfusion for which no licensed donor screening is available. The transmission risk of Babesia microti is comparable to the transmission risk of HIV, HBV, and HCV prior to the implementation of routine blood screening programs for these pathogens. Screening of blood products for Babesia microti, therefore, has become a priority for the FDA.
 
 4


To address the need for effective blood screening assays, we have three assays that have demonstrated ability to detect Babesia microti in donated blood. Our antibody and PCR tests are the subject of two pending BLA applications and are offered from our Massachusetts laboratory. These tests were the subject of an extensive clinical trial, completed under an FDA Investigational New Drug, or IND, application and in cooperation with the American Red Cross, which screened approximately 90,000 blood samples to evaluate the effectiveness of our testing regime in detecting Babesia microti infected donors. No reported cases of transfusion-transmitted babesiosis were associated with the 75,331 screened donations from high risk states as compared to 14 cases per 253,031 unscreened donations. Based upon the study results, we believe our antibody and PCR tests are effective for screening blood for Babesia microti. The results of the clinical trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in December 2016.
 
We also have a second antibody test that may be used to screen for Babesia microti in blood donor samples. This test utilizes a standard ELISA platform and would be offered as a kit for laboratories seeking to screen units of blood for Babesia microti in-house. Our BLA application for this test remains pending with FDA. In mid-February, the Company received a complete response letter, or CRL, from FDA which raised a number of questions related to the Company’s submissions in the fourth quarter of 2017 in support of licensure.  Given FDA’s previous verbal comments to the Company, the CRL was unexpected and will delay licensure and commercialization of the assay. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $7.2 million to write off the intangible assets related to the assay.

Transplantation
 
The most recent available information indicates that over 160,000 transplants are conducted in the world every year. Kidney and hematopoietic stem cell transplants comprise the majority of the market. The majority of transplants are performed in hospitals or clinics specializing in transplantation and thus represent a fairly concentrated sales call point. 
 
Our T-SPOT.CMV test currently targets the transplant market. Technical development of this test has been completed and clinical validation activities are currently underway. 
 
Our T-SPOT.CMV test measures the strength of a patient’s T cell response to CMV infection. Once infected with CMV, the virus remains in the body for life and is an opportunistic pathogen. It is present in up to 90% of the human adult population, most of whom successfully control its progression through their T cell response. For those with weakened immune systems such as transplant recipients, however, CMV presents a significant source of morbidity. Our T-SPOT.CMV test provides information that may be useful in informing management strategies of patients at risk of CMV infection and disease, such as transplant patients. Our T-SPOT.CMV test is CE marked in the European Union. In the U.S., our CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited laboratory in Tennessee performs this test. We continue to take a measured approach to market introduction of this test as we await final results of our two pivotal clinical studies involving this test.
 
Regulatory approvals and clinical validation 
 
Tuberculosis
 
Our T-SPOT.TB test is approved for commercial sale in over 50 countries. Key geographies where we have regulatory approval include: 
 

● | The United States. We obtained PMA for our T-SPOT.TB test from the FDA in 2008. Since 2008, an additional ten PMA supplements have been approved, including supplements relating to manufacturing improvements and label extensions, such as those that enable overnight shipment of blood samples.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Europe. We obtained a CE mark in 2004, which allows us to sell our T-SPOT.TB test in Europe as well as other countries that accept the CE mark.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | China. We obtained initial approval for our T-SPOT.TB test from the China Food and Drug Administration, or the CFDA, in 2010. Consistent with CFDA re-registration requirements, we secured re-registration of our test in 2014, which will remain effective until 2019.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Japan. We obtained approval for our T-SPOT.TB test from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, or MHLW, in 2012.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to being validated in multiple clinical studies, our T-SPOT.TB test has also been the subject of nearly 500 peer-reviewed publications in scientific journals including several meta-analyses. 
 
Tick-borne diseases and transplantation
 
Our C6 Lyme ELISA kit is FDA cleared and CE marked in the European Union. The test has been the subject of over 20 peer-reviewed publications.
 
Our service-based tests for tick-borne diseases are offered as laboratory developed tests from our CLIA certified, CAP accredited laboratory in Massachusetts. Our tests have been the subject of more than 20 peer-reviewed publications.
 
Competitive landscape
 
Tuberculosis
 
Our T-SPOT.TB test competes primarily with the TST. We believe our T-SPOT.TB test has a number of compelling advantages that make it a superior alternative to the more than 100-year-old TST, including superior sensitivity and specificity, simplicity of administration and elimination of variability due to subjective interpretation of results. Although the TST is often considered to be inexpensive, as the PPD reagent and other materials used in the test typically cost less than $5 per test, the materials cost is only one element of the total cost involved when conducting a TB screening program or TB control strategy. Substantial costs beyond the materials cost of the TST test include additional costs associated with: (i) false-negatives and false-positives, which risk non-detection and require additional confirmatory tests; (ii) individuals who fail to return within the prescribed period and, therefore, require re-testing; and (iii) implementing and maintaining training programs for healthcare workers who administer and read TST tests. 
 
 5


Several studies have been published investigating the costs or cost-effectiveness of a TB screening program in the healthcare worker setting using the TST and in comparison to our T-SPOT.TB test. We believe these studies are informative in demonstrating how expensive the TST actually is to implement and how using our T-SPOT.TB test in preference to the TST can be a more cost-effective solution when implementing TB screening programs. 
 
Other than the TST, our principal competitor is the QuantiFERON®3-TB Gold Plus test, or QFN Plus, which was approved for sale in the U.S. in 2017 and has been available in Europe since 2016. Early publications suggest similar performance characteristics between QFN Plus and its predecessor. QFN Plus, however, requires use of a fourth specialized antigen-coated blood collection tube, either at the time of blood draw or later, which may increase phlebotomy complexity and time requirements. The additional blood collection tube also increases lab processing expense as it requires an additional well per test. 
 
We have been competing with QFN Plus, or prior versions of this test, since the launch of our T-SPOT.TB test in 2004. Based on our experience, we believe that we have several performance advantages over QFN Plus, including:
 

● | In our pivotal clinical studies conducted in support of our PMA, T-SPOT.TB test results were not impacted by immunocompromised status or immunosuppression. The U.S. package insert for the QFN Plus test notes that the test has not been extensively evaluated in individuals with impaired or altered immune function and that the minimum number of lymphocytes required for a reliable test result has not been established and may also be variable. We believe this is an important differentiating factor in patient populations with weakened immune systems, such as those on biologic therapies, corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive treatments, those with HIV and those undergoing dialysis or organ transplantation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the FDA pivotal studies in the United States, our T-SPOT.TB test was shown to have sensitivity advantages over the QFN Plus test.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to the performance advantages we believe we have over QFN Plus, we have developed and implemented the ability to offer our test as a service in the United States and the United Kingdom. The significant advantages of offering our test as a service include marketing opportunities created through the development of direct customer relationships, more convenient and extensive (7 days a week) access to testing via our logistics infrastructure, faster and more efficient customer on-boarding as a result of the simplicity of our pre-paid shipper boxes, and greater utility for our customers due to additional services we can provide beyond a test result. 
 
As a result of clinical and service advantages, we have been able to negotiate a higher average selling price for our service. We believe this advantage provides us a larger addressable market than is available through selling kits as done by QFN Plus; simply put, our revenue potential from the same testing volume is higher. This advantage has been further strengthened as a result of the recent adjustments to the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule based upon the provisions of the Protect Access to Medicare Act, or PAMA. In 2017, The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, reimbursement for our test under CPT code 86481 was approximately $103 per test; CMS reimbursement for QFN Plus under CPT code 86480 was approximately $85 per test. Under PAMA, reimbursement for our T-SPOT.TB test for the years 2018-2020 will remain largely unchanged from 2017 rates. In contrast, the reimbursement for QFN Plus will decrease by 27% by 2020. We believe that the increased difference in reimbursement under PAMA provides us with pricing and access advantages in certain segments of the U.S. market. 
 
Tick-borne diseases
 
Historically, the tick-borne disease testing market has been served by undifferentiated assays focused mainly on Lyme disease. The U.S. CDC guidelines, which are now over 20 years old and were formulated when the incidence Lyme and other tick-borne diseases was far lower, recommend the use of a 2-tier methodology for Lyme disease testing consisting of an initial screening by EIA or IFA followed by a confirmatory western blot for equivocal or positive EIA or IFA results. This methodology has three limitations: 1) it relies solely on indirect serological detection of infection; 2) serology testing can be insensitive within the first few weeks following infection; and 3) it does not address testing for co-infection with other organisms that cause tick-borne diseases. 
 
The competitive landscape for diagnostics directed to tick-borne diseases is largely fragmented in the U.S. with national laboratories, regional laboratories and specialty laboratories offering various tests utilizing a range of established technologies and laboratory techniques. Large community and academic hospitals may offer tick-borne disease testing ‘in-house’ i.e., within their laboratories, but it is typically limited to Lyme disease testing, as no FDA-approved test kits exist for ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, babesiosis and several other tick-borne diseases other than Lyme. National laboratories, including Quest Diagnostics Inc. and Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, have broad geographic reach in the U.S. and offer a range of antibody screening and PCR tests targeting Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. Regional laboratories focus on particular geographic areas within the U.S. and differ in the variety of tick-borne disease tests offered while specialty laboratories tend to have more limited test menus, especially for tick-borne diseases other than Lyme disease.

We believe that our growing portfolio of tick-borne disease tests offers a significant competitive advantage relative to the existing products on the market. Through the combination of PCR and antibody tests offered through our Massachusetts laboratory, we are able to detect the organism that causes the tick-borne disease as well as the antibody response to the organism. Our service approach accommodates a wider diagnostic window and aims to provide additional information to clinicians about the stage of infection than the traditional test for Lyme disease. Based upon our tick-borne disease database, we are able to offer a comparative analysis of past and current samples to better inform the interpretation of the results. Our database also enables us to offer customers tests tailored to the tick-borne diseases present in their local geographies. Our test result turnaround time of 24-48 hours from time of sample receipt also provides us with a competitive advantage. 
 
Our pipeline
 
As noted above, our late-stage pipeline consists of three assays for use in screening the U.S. blood supply for Babesia microti and our T-SPOT.CMV test. In addition, we have active development programs to enhance our TB and tick-borne disease product offerings. With regard to TB, we are developing multiple product enhancements that aim to improve the clinical utility of our test and improve test workflow and automation. These enhancements will also serve to increase the barriers to entry in both the U.S. and outside the U.S. 
 
In tick-borne disease, we continue to develop enhancements to improve the accuracy of Lyme disease diagnosis and recently commenced a prospective clinical study earlier this year. This study, named the Lyme Test Indication Combinations or LyTIC Study, aims to establish the performance of individual tests, including our Spirofind assay, and combinations of tests in diagnosis of early Lyme infection. Our SpiroFind assay targets Lyme disease and may provide both an earlier diagnosis and the ability to differentiate re-infections from prior exposure. This assay would complement our existing assays offering comprehensive testing for tick-borne infections.
 
We also have additional assays in technical development which target other tick-borne infectious diseases endemic to the U.S.
 
Our total research and development expenses were $16.7 million, $13.9 million, and $10.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
Intellectual property 
 
We seek to secure and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology platform and of our existing and planned products. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, and confidentiality, license and invention assignment agreements and other contracts to protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, we have developed substantial knowledge in the field of immunology diagnostics including proprietary methods that we believe provide us with a significant advantage relative to potential competitors.
 
The intellectual property relating to our T-SPOT.TB test that we own or license includes 12 issued U.S. patents, 13 issued patents in other jurisdictions, one pending U.S. patent application and two pending patent applications in other jurisdictions, as well as registered trademarks, proprietary manufacturing processes and protocols, and proprietary methods directed towards achieving rapid throughput in assay performance.
 
Our owned and licensed patents 
 
Many of the patent rights we own or in-license have claims directed to the use of ESAT-6 and/or CFP10 to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We believe that these are the most important TB-specific antigens and we include peptides from both of these in our T-SPOT.TB test. We also believe that using an ELISPOT technique for an IGRA enhances its accuracy and suitability for use in testing individuals with compromised immune systems. Our T-SPOT.TB test employs this technique.
 
Our technology patents contain claims to methods of measuring marker-specific effector T cell responses at a single-cell level to certain peptides of ESAT-6 to diagnose TB infection. In December 2017, as part of the settlement of our patent infringement action, we received a one-time, lump sum payment of $27.5 million from Qiagen Inc., or Qiagen. The settlement agreement included a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to certain of our patents for use in Qiagen’s QFN products. See “Legal Proceedings” for more information. These patents expire in 2019. 
 
The inventions claimed in our patents relating to removal of granulocytes from stored blood samples may also have applications in relation to other diseases, conditions or situations where blood samples cannot be tested soon after the blood draw. This proprietary method is a core part of the T-SPOT technology as it improves the stability of stored blood enabling the overnight shipment of blood samples. The patents covering these inventions expire in 2027 (outside of the U.S.) and 2028 (U.S.).

We have also licensed two patents on a non-exclusive basis that relate to our T-SPOT.CMV test and four patents that relate to our C6 Lyme ELISA kit. In connection with our acquisitions of Boulder Diagnostics, Inc., or Boulder, and Immunetics, Inc., or Immunetics, we gained access to additional patents that we believe may assist us to develop future diagnostic tests in the infectious disease or transplant fields. We have licensed certain patents related to the detection of antibody-secreting B cells specific for HLA and to the PCR and IFA tests performed at our Massachusetts laboratory. We also have two patents under license and acquired a patent family application, pending in four territories, relating to additional TB antigens. The expected expiration dates of the licensed patents range from March 2018 to May 2032. We can give no assurance that any of our current or future research and development programs will result in the development and validation of any diagnostic test that leverages any of these patents or patent applications or otherwise.
 
Our license and assignment agreements 
 
We currently rely upon several license agreements to obtain rights under certain patents that we believe may be necessary to make, use and sell our products. We may in the future rely, at least in part, upon licensing agreements with third parties to obtain patent rights and transfers of technology, information and know-how to enable us to take advantage of research work already completed, including potentially the identification of antigens useful for measuring disease conditions. We believe such licensing arrangements have enabled us, and may in the future enable us, to reduce the amount of time we need to develop and validate new diagnostic tests. 
 
We have royalty obligations under some of our current license agreements that are measured in part based upon our sales levels. Where our royalty obligations are calculated on our net sales, the definition of net sales varies by agreement and typically results in a lower effective royalty rate on our service revenue than on sales of our kits. Currently, our aggregate royalty burden for our T-SPOT.TB test under all license and assignment agreements, as a percentage of gross product and service revenue, is in the low single digits. Our royalty burden for our T-SPOT.CMV test under all license agreements, as a percentage of gross product and service revenue, is also in the low single digits. Under our license agreements, we may be responsible for paying, or contributing to, patent prosecution and maintenance costs or subject to diligence obligations. We believe we are in compliance with all obligations of our license agreements. 
 
Tuberculosis related patents
 
In 2013, we entered into an assignment agreement with Isis Innovation Limited, now known as Oxford University Innovation Ltd., or Oxford Innovation, pursuant to which various patents we previously licensed from Oxford Innovation were assigned to us. We have ongoing obligations under the assignment agreement to make payments to Oxford Innovation until the patents expire and to continue to extend license rights to Oxford University, its employees, students, agents and appointees to use the technology for academic and research purposes. Our rights under the patents are subject to various grants of license rights, including (i) a license back to Oxford Innovation to maintain a pre-existing license for research use only, (ii) a pre-existing grant to a third party of non-exclusive rights under the patents covering a field of two infectious diseases, and (iii) a pre-existing grant to a third party of non-exclusive rights under the patents limited to the licensee’s internal use to monitor vaccine response. 
 
The amount we pay to Oxford Innovation for our royalty obligation is equal to a royalty rate in the low single digits. Our aggregate royalty obligation payments to Oxford Innovation through December 31, 2017 have been $3.2 million. Our royalty obligations to Oxford Innovation will cease when there are no valid patent claims still in force.
 
Finally, our license agreement with Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, or Rutgers, grants us an exclusive license to certain patents to manufacture and commercialize kits for in vitro diagnostic assays relating to TB other than in the ELISA format. The license was made in 2006 and has been amended in 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2016 and 2017. Our license is royalty-bearing, worldwide, with the right to sublicense. We have not granted any sublicenses under this license. Rutgers has reserved the right to grant one additional license to this technology, limited to an ELISA format. To date, we do not believe Rutgers has entered into any such license. 
 
We must make semi-annual royalty payments to Rutgers. Although the agreement contains minimum royalty obligations, the amount of royalties due based on our actual sales utilizing the licensed patents has exceeded the minimum for a number of years and we expect our royalties on actual sales will continue to exceed the minimum for the duration of our royalty obligations. We pay a royalty rate in the low single digits. Our aggregate payments to Rutgers through December 31, 2017 for signing fees, annual fees, milestones and royalties, including minimum royalties, have been $5.9 million. Our royalty obligations to Rutgers will cease when there are no valid patent claims still in force covering licensed products or assays. Previously, we made a number of other payments to Rutgers for license issue fees, annual license fees and milestone payments. No such future payments are required under the license. 
 
Tick-borne disease related patents
 
We license patents relating to our tick-borne disease products from Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., or Roche, Life Technologies Corporation, or Life Technologies, and Tulane University, or Tulane. The licenses from Roche and Life Technologies pertain to patents covering aspects of the PCR and IFA test methods, respectively, used at our Massachusetts laboratory. Both are fully paid up licenses with no ongoing royalty obligations. The patents that are the subject of the licenses expire in 2018.

Our C6 Lyme ELISA kit incorporates the VIsE protein and C6 peptide, the most immunodominant portion of the VIsE protein. The protein is the subject of a patent held by Tulane. The license from Tulane grants us the exclusive right to use the C6 peptide in a diagnostic test for Lyme disease in humans. The license from Tulane has a royalty rate in the single digits and expires in 2019.
 
Trademarks and other protection
 
The trademarks we employ in our business include T-SPOT, T-Cell Xtend, Oxford Diagnostic Laboratories, ODL, the Oxford Immunotec logo, our laboratory logo, the Imugen logo and the word Immunetics. We have obtained registrations in the United States for T-SPOT, T-Cell Xtend, Oxford Diagnostic Laboratories, the Oxford Immunotec logo and the Imugen logo and the word Immunetics. We have also obtained or are seeking registrations for certain of these trademarks in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, the European Community, Japan and China. We have also secured numerous internet domain name registrations. 
 
We have a policy of requiring all our employees to sign agreements that obligate them to maintain in confidence all confidential information they receive during the course of their employment, except in certain circumstances. Substantially all of our employees are also bound by invention assignment obligations, which provide that rights to all inventions and other types of intellectual property, whether or not patentable, conceived by them during the course of employment are assigned to us. We seek to enter into similar confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our consultants.
 
Our Trade Secrets 

There are several areas in which we have developed trade secrets relating to manufacturing that we believe provide a competitive advantage not only with respect to our T-SPOT.TB test, but also for the other tests we perform at our laboratories. It is essential to the performance of ELISPOT tests used to detect the release of interferon-gamma from stimulated T cells that the microtiter plates used in the test be smoothly coated with the proper amount of interferon-gamma antibodies. For volume manufacturing, these coated plates must also meet stringent shelf life requirements. Our plate-coating process meets these criteria and cost-effectively provides reliable results. We believe this approach results in significant cost savings for us without sacrificing our compliance with either good manufacturing practices or our own high standards. 
 
As part of our test offerings, we use unique formulations of peptides and other reagents that we believe are important to the accuracy of our tests. Further, we have devoted substantial time and resources to the development of processes and techniques that have resulted in cost reductions in our test manufacture and in assay performance in our service laboratories. In our ODL facilities, we have streamlined the workflow process in our laboratories to allow for rapid throughput, which reduces labor costs and reduces the time we take to provide test results to our customers. In addition, we have developed and validated automated solutions for the assay process, including proprietary protocols for maximizing efficiencies garnered from the automation equipment. These methods are useful in our current test offerings, and will be applicable to future tests we may develop using our T-SPOT technology and other platforms. We believe the manufacturing process and assay performance efficiencies we have developed and employ could not easily or quickly be developed by others.
 
Manufacturing and laboratory facilities
 
Our tests are generally manufactured by us from materials we obtain from a limited number of suppliers. We manufacture our T-SPOT.TB test at our U.K. corporate headquarters in Abingdon, England, where we currently lease approximately 2,800 square feet of manufacturing space. The lease covering this space expires in 2020 and our current rent for the manufacturing space is $102,000 annually, which is subject to change. Our manufacturing facility is certified to ISO 13485 and ISO 9001. Our space in Abingdon also includes 6,400 square feet of storage/warehouse space. The leases covering this space expire in 2025 and our current rent for the storage/warehouse space is $75,000 annually, which is subject to change.
 
We also operate a laboratory in Abingdon, England, where we currently lease approximately 2,100 square feet of space divided equally between our diagnostic testing laboratory and our research and development and quality control laboratory. The leases for these facilities expire in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Our current rent for the total U.K. laboratory space is $83,000 annually, which is subject to change.
 
In 2017, we executed an agreement for lease for new space in Abingdon, England that will allow us to combine our manufacturing, laboratory, storage and office operations into a single facility. We expect to take occupancy of the new space in the second half of 2018. 
 
We operate two diagnostic testing laboratories in the United States where we process samples sent to us by our customers who choose the service format of our product offering. Our U.S. laboratory facility, located in Memphis, Tennessee performs our T-SPOT.TB test and performs our T-SPOT.CMV test. Our current lease for the Tennessee laboratory facility covers approximately 35,000 square feet of space and expires in 2021. Our current rent under this lease is $150,000 annually and is subject to annual increases. 
 
Our second U.S. laboratory is located in Norwood, Massachusetts and performs both our T-SPOT.TB and tick-borne disease testing. Our current lease for the Norwood laboratory facility covers approximately 58,000 square feet of space divided between two buildings. During 2018, we expect to consolidate our current facilities into a single building and reduce our space under lease to approximately 40,000 square feet. Our current lease expires in March 2023 and rent for our Norwood operations is approximately $975,000 and is subject to annual increases. We also currently lease approximately 14,000 square feet in Boston, Massachusetts, which includes a clinical and research laboratory directed to the development and testing of the products acquired from Immunetics. The lease for the Boston facility expires in July 2018 at which time the operations will be consolidated into the Norwood, Massachusetts facility. Current rent under this lease is $263,000 annually.

Key customer relationships 
 
Given the diversity of our product and service offerings, our customers include large hospital systems, public and private institutions such as universities, public health departments and physician groups. Our customer relationships also include our distributors outside of the U.S. We believe our relationships with two of the distributors of our T-SPOT.TB test are key customer relationships. 
 
Shanghai Fosun Long March Medical Science Co. Ltd. We have a distribution agreement with Shanghai Fosun Long March Medical Science Co. Ltd., or Fosun, pursuant to which Fosun distributes our TB-related products in China. Under the distribution agreement, Fosun serves as our exclusive distributor in a territory consisting of the People’s Republic of China, including Macau Special Administrative Regions, and also serves as our non-exclusive distributor in Hong Kong. Fosun commits to using its best efforts to promote, sell and distribute our products in the territory in compliance with our policies and procedures and applicable law. The agreement imposes certain annual minimum purchase obligations at agreed upon pricing and covers our products, as well as other accessories which may be used in conjunction with our products. Fosun is obligated to refrain from dealing in any products in the territory which would be competitive with ours through a period extending 12 months after the termination of the agreement.

Either party may terminate the agreement for a material uncured breach or in the event of bankruptcy or an equivalent winding up of the other party’s business. We may terminate the agreement if Fosun does not meet the minimum purchase requirements, for late payment or if Fosun undergoes a change in control. In December 2017, we amended the distribution agreement to provide a certain rebate in Fosun’s discount programs in 2017, subject to Fosun’s achievement of minimum purchase quantities. 
 
Riken Genesis Co., Ltd. We sell our T-SPOT.TB test to a Japanese importer, Riken Genesis Co., Ltd., or Riken, which also serves as our marketing authorization holder in Japan, a position required by Japanese regulatory authorities. We entered into a marketing authorization holder agreement with Riken in 2011 and it was amended in 2013, 2016 and 2017. Pursuant to this agreement, Riken provides services for importation into Japan. We initially paid an initiation fee to Riken in the amount of ¥200,000, or approximately $1,600. We currently pay Riken a flat monthly fee in the amount of ¥150,000, or approximately $1,300, and also pay a single-digit percentage commission based on the prices at which end users purchase our products. The initial agreement with Riken had a one-year term and automatically renews for additional one-year periods in the absence of specified notice by either party. Either party may terminate for a material uncured breach or in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings of the other party.
 
Government regulation
 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
 
In the United States, in vitro diagnostics, or IVDs, are regulated by the FDA as either medical devices or biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, depending on their intended use. IVDs that are used as diagnostics are regulated as medical devices. IVDs that are used to screen donor blood are regulated as biological products, which have two different regulatory pathways. 
 
Marketing pathways 
 
There are two regulatory pathways to receive authorization to market IVDs intended for diagnostic purposes: a premarket application, or PMA, and a 510(k) premarket notification. The regulatory pathway to receive authorization to market an IVD intended for blood screening is by a Biologics License Application, or BLA. The FDCA establishes a risk-based standard for determination of the pathway for which a particular IVD device is eligible. 
 
The information that must be submitted to the FDA to obtain clearance or approval to market a new medical device varies depending on how the medical device is classified by the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes on the basis of the controls necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are subject to general controls, including labeling and adherence to the FDA’s quality system regulation, which establishes device-specific good manufacturing practices. Class II devices are subject to general controls and special controls, including performance standards and post-market surveillance. Class III devices are subject to these requirements as well as to premarket approval. Most Class I devices are exempt from premarket submissions to the FDA; most Class II devices require the submission of a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA; and Class III devices require submission of a PMA application. Our T-SPOT.TB test is a Class III device and our C6 Lyme ELISA kit is a Class II device. We have other Class II devices that have received 510(k) clearance from FDA that we acquired through our acquisition of Immunetics. 
 
 11


Premarket approval. The PMA process, by which we received marketing authorization for our T-SPOT.TB test in 2008, is complex, costly and time consuming. A PMA application must be supported by detailed and comprehensive scientific evidence, including clinical data, to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the medical device for its intended purpose. If the device is determined to present a “significant risk,” the sponsor may not begin a clinical trial until it submits an investigational device exemption, or IDE, to the FDA and obtains approval from the FDA to begin the trial. After the PMA application is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to make a threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the application is complete, the FDA will accept it for filing. The FDA is subject to a non-binding performance goal review time for a PMA application of 180 days from the date of filing, although in practice this review time is often longer. Questions from the FDA, requests for additional data and referrals to advisory committees may delay the process considerably. Indeed, the total process may take several years and there is no guarantee that the PMA application will ever be approved. Even if approved, the FDA may limit the indications for which the device may be marketed. The FDA may also request additional clinical data as a condition of approval or after the PMA is issued. Any changes to the medical device may require a supplemental PMA application to be submitted and approved. Since we received initial PMA application approval of our T-SPOT.TB test in 2008, the FDA has granted approval for ten supplemental PMA applications for our T-SPOT.TB test, including supplements relating to the use of our T-Cell Xtend reagent with our T-SPOT.TB test. 
 
510(k) Clearance. Our C6 Lyme ELISA kit has obtained 510(k) clearance from FDA. A traditional 510(k) submission requires demonstration of substantial equivalence to a previous legally marketed device that was not subject to PMA. If a substantial equivalence cannot be demonstrated and the test is of low to moderate risk, the FDA may allow a de novo 510(k) submission. Submission of either a traditional or de novo 510(k) notification is subject to a 90-day FDA review period. Questions from the FDA, requests for additional data and referrals to advisory committees may delay the process considerably and the FDA may ultimately limit the indications for which the device may be marketed. Marketing of an IVD medical device may begin as soon as FDA clearance is granted. 
 
Biologics License Application. The BLA process is similar to a PMA in that it must be supported by detailed and comprehensive scientific evidence, including clinical data to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the biological product for its intended use in donor blood screening. Blood screening assay development follows the same general pathway followed for drugs and vaccines. Before an application is submitted, an Investigational New Drug application (IND) must be submitted and completed. The IND describes the biological product, its method of manufacture, and quality control tests for release, as well the comprehensive clinical trial protocols. We currently have three BLAs under review by FDA.
 
FDA Guidance on Laboratory Developed Tests. The FDA has historically exercised enforcement discretion over the regulation of Laboratory Developed Tests, or LDTs. In October 2014, the FDA issued draft guidance for the oversight of LDTs that included notification and medical device reporting. Under the draft guidance, the FDA sought to classify LDTs as high, medium or low risk tests, which would then dictate the regulatory route to be followed for each test. In November 2016, the FDA announced that it would not finalize its guidance during 2016. It is uncertain whether the guidance in its current form will be finalized or if, and when, alternate guidance may be issued by the agency. 
 
Post-marketing regulations and controls 
 
Under the medical device and biological products regulations, the FDA regulates quality control and manufacturing procedures by requiring us to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the quality system regulation, which sets forth the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices requirements for medical devices and biological products. The FDA monitors compliance with the quality system regulation and current good manufacturing practices requirements by conducting periodic inspections of manufacturing facilities. FDA inspections in the United States are typically unannounced. FDA inspections outside the United States are coordinated with the companies being inspected. Violations of applicable regulations noted by the FDA during inspections of our manufacturing facilities could adversely affect the continued marketing of our tests. 
 
The FDA also enforces post-marketing controls that include the requirement to submit product reports to the agency when a manufacturer becomes aware of information suggesting that any of its marketed products may have caused or contributed to a death, serious injury or serious illness or any of its products has malfunctioned and that a recurrence of a malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or illness. The FDA relies on product reports to identify product problems and utilizes these reports to determine, among other things, whether it should exercise its enforcement powers. The FDA also enforces the requirement that manufacturers submit reports of recalls and field actions to the FDA if the actions are initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. The FDA may also require post-market surveillance studies for specified devices. 
 
FDA regulations also govern, among other things, the preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, distribution, labeling and promotion of medical devices and biological products. In addition to compliance with good manufacturing practices and product reporting requirements, we are required to comply with the FDCA’s general controls, including establishment registration, device listing and labeling requirements. If we fail to comply with any requirements under the FDCA, we could be subject to, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or product corrections, total or partial suspension of production, denial of premarket notification clearance or approval of products, rescission or withdrawal of clearances and approvals, and criminal prosecution. We cannot assure you that any final FDA policy, once issued, or future laws and regulations concerning the manufacture or marketing of medical devices will not increase the cost and time to market of new or existing tests. If we fail to comply with these FDA regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, the FDA.

International medical device regulations 
 
International marketing of medical devices is subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The European Commission is the legislative body responsible for directives with which manufacturers selling medical products in the European Union and the European Economic Area, or EEA, must comply. The European Union includes most of the major countries in Europe, while other countries, such as Switzerland, are part of the EEA and have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices. The European Union has adopted directives that address regulation of the design, manufacture, labeling, clinical studies and post-market vigilance for medical devices, including IVDs. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive, including the IVD Directive (Directive 98/79 EC), will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be marketed throughout the European Union and EEA.
 
Outside of the European Union, regulatory pathways for the marketing of medical devices vary greatly from country to country. In many countries, local regulatory agencies conduct an independent review of IVD medical devices prior to granting marketing approval. For example, in China, approval by the CFDA, must be obtained prior to marketing an IVD medical device. In Japan, approval by the MHLW following review by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or the PMDA is required prior to marketing an IVD. The process in such countries may be lengthy and require the expenditure of significant resources, including the conduct of clinical trials. In other countries, the regulatory pathway may be shorter and/or less costly. The timeline for the introduction of new IVD medical devices is heavily impacted by these various regulations on a country-by-country basis, which may become more lengthy and costly over time.
 
Our T-SPOT.TB test has been approved for sale in over 50 countries, including in Europe, China, and Japan. Our T-SPOT.TB test obtained a CE mark in 2004, CFDA approval in China in 2010 and re-registration in 2014, and MHLW approval in Japan in 2012. Our T-SPOT.CMV and T-SPOT.PRT tests obtained CE marks in 2015 and our C6 Lyme ELISA kit obtained a CE mark in 2011. 
 
Laboratory certification, accreditation and licensing 
 
As a company engaged in the diagnostic testing business, we are required to maintain certain federal and state licenses, certificates and permits.
 
United States. In the United States, CLIA imposes requirements relating to test processes, personnel qualifications, facilities and equipment, record keeping, quality assurance and participation in proficiency testing, which involves comparing the results of tests on specimens that have been specifically prepared for our laboratory to the known results of the specimens. The CLIA requirements also apply as a condition for participation by clinical laboratories under the Medicare program. Under the CLIA regulations, the complexity of the tests performed determines the level of regulatory control. United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, classifies our T-SPOT tests and our tests directed to tick-borne diseases as high-complexity tests. As a result, we must employ more experienced and highly educated personnel, as well as additional categories of employees. 
 
HHS, or an organization to which HHS delegates authority, verifies compliance with CLIA standards through periodic on-site inspections. Sanctions for failure to meet these certification, accreditation and licensure requirements include suspension or revocation of the certification, accreditation or license, as well as imposition of plans to correct deficiencies, injunctive actions and civil and criminal penalties. If HHS should remove or suspend our CLIA certificates, we would be forced to cease performing testing at our U.S. laboratories in Memphis, Tennessee or Norwood, Massachusetts. 
 
Our U.S. laboratories are also accredited by CAP. The CAP Laboratory Accreditation Program is an internationally recognized program that utilizes teams of practicing laboratory professionals as inspectors, and accreditation by CAP can often be used to meet CLIA and state certification requirements. Additionally, a few states require out-of-state laboratories to obtain a license prior to performing testing on samples originating from such states and to take certain notice or approval steps in connection with the performance by such laboratories of additional tests. The failure to maintain such licenses or approvals would force us to cease performing the applicable tests on samples originating from such a state. 
 
United Kingdom. Our laboratory located in the United Kingdom operates under accreditation by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service, or UKAS, for the International Standard: ISO 17025:2005 (General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories). Compliance with this standard is required to maintain accreditation and the continued use of the UKAS logo on our laboratory documentation. National Health Service (NHS)-based customers require that the testing services they procure operate to an accredited quality management system, which is evidenced by the UKAS accreditation. Therefore, a failure to maintain this accreditation could cause us to lose a substantial majority of our U.K. service business. 
 
HIPAA and other privacy laws

U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, established for the first time in the United States comprehensive protection for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations, or Covered Entities: health plans, healthcare clearing houses, and healthcare providers that conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically. Covered Entities and their Business Associates, as defined in HIPAA, must have in place administrative, physical, and technical standards to guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health information. Because we are a healthcare provider and we conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically, we are currently a Covered Entity, and we must have in place the administrative, physical, and technical safeguards required by HIPAA, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations. Additionally, some state laws impose privacy protections more stringent than HIPAA. We may conduct other activities that may implicate HIPAA, such as conducting clinical studies or entering into specific kinds of relationships with a Covered Entity or a Business Associate of a Covered Entity.

If we or our operations are found to be in violation of HIPAA, HITECH or their implementing regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, fines, and exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against Covered Entities, their Business Associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
 
Our activities must also comply with international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information. For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation covers personal information of citizens of the European Union and imposes strict penalties for noncompliance. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws could significantly impact our business and our future plans. 
 
U.S. federal and state billing and fraud and abuse laws 
 
Although only about 15% of our U.S. clinical diagnostics business currently involves payment by third-party payors, including government payors, we are subject to numerous laws governing billing for health care services. 
 
Antifraud laws / overpayments. As participants in federal and state healthcare programs, we are subject to numerous federal and state anti-fraud and abuse laws. Prohibitions under some of these laws include:
 

● | the submission of false claims or false information to government programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | deceptive or fraudulent conduct;
--+---------------------------------


● | excessive or unnecessary services or services at excessive prices; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | defrauding private sector health insurers.
--+-------------------------------------------

 
We could be subject to substantial penalties for violations of these laws, including denial of payment, obligation to issue refunds, suspension of payments from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs and exclusion from participation in the federal healthcare programs, as well as civil and criminal penalties and imprisonment. One of these statutes, the False Claims Act, is a key enforcement tool used by the government to combat healthcare fraud.
 
Numerous federal and state agencies enforce anti-fraud and abuse laws. In addition, private insurers may bring private actions. In some circumstances, private whistleblowers are authorized to bring fraud suits on behalf of the government against providers and are entitled to receive a portion of any final recovery.
 
U.S. federal and state “anti-kickback” and “self-referral” restrictions 
 
Anti-kickback statute. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. 
 
Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and do not contain identical safe harbors.
 
If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. We may also be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations.
 
Self-referral law. We are subject to a federal “self-referral” law, commonly referred to as the “Stark” law, which provides, unless a specific exception applies, that physicians who, personally or through a family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with a laboratory are prohibited from making a referral to that laboratory for laboratory tests reimbursable by Medicare, and also prohibits laboratories from submitting a claim for Medicare payments for laboratory tests referred by physicians who, personally or through a family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with the testing laboratory. 
 
 14


We are subject to comparable state laws, some of which apply to all payors regardless of source of payment, and do not contain identical exceptions to the Stark law. The self-referral laws may cause some physicians who would otherwise use our laboratory to use other laboratories for their testing. Providers are subject to sanctions for claims submitted for each service that is furnished based on a referral prohibited under the federal self-referral laws. These sanctions include denial of payment, obligation to issue refunds, civil monetary payments and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and civil monetary penalties. They may also include penalties for applicable violations of the False Claims Act, which may require payment of up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of up to about $11,000 to $22,000 for each separate false claim. 
 
U.S. health care reform 
 
In March 2010, the PPACA was enacted, which included measures that significantly changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Changes were made to the PPACA as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to remove certain parts of the original legislation and the current Congress continues to make efforts to repeal and/or replace the PPACA. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act, enacted as part of PPACA, has not been repealed and requires medical device manufacturers to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any “transfer of value” made or distributed to such entities, as well as any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to report this information to CMS. Various states have also implemented regulations prohibiting certain financial interactions with healthcare professionals and/or mandating public disclosure of such financial interactions. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. 
 
Other laws 
 
We are also subject to numerous U.S. federal, state and local laws as well as international laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and transportation and disposal of blood and hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 457 employees. None of our employees is covered under a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we believe our employee relations are good. 
 
Environmental matters
 
Our operations require the use of hazardous materials, which, among other matters, subjects us to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements, including those relating to the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of biological and hazardous materials and wastes. The primary hazardous materials we handle or use include human blood samples and solvents. Some of the regulations under the current regulatory structure provide for strict liability, holding a party liable for contamination at currently and formerly owned, leased and operated sites and at third-party sites without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our, or others’, operations or activities should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. We could also be subject to significant fines for failure to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements. We cannot predict how changes in laws or development of new regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance.
