Item 1. Business 
Overview 
 We are a commercial-stage diagnostics company committed to reducing healthcare costs and improving patient care through the provision of innovative tests within established markets. Our initial focus is on blood grouping and donor disease screening, which is commonly referred to as transfusion diagnostics. Blood grouping involves specific procedures performed at donor or patient testing laboratories to characterize blood, which includes antigen typing and antibody detection. Disease screening involves the screening of donor blood for unwanted pathogens using two different methods, a serological approach (testing for specific antigens or antibodies) and a molecular approach (testing for DNA or RNA).
 We have over 30 years of experience developing, manufacturing and commercializing conventional reagent products used for blood grouping within the global transfusion diagnostics market. We are developing MosaiQ, our proprietary technology platform, to better address the comprehensive needs of this large and established market. MosaiQ will initially comprise two separate microarrays, one for immunohematology (blood grouping), or IH, and one for serological disease screening, or SDS, and a high-throughput instrument. We are also developing a third microarray for molecular disease screening. We believe MosaiQ has the potential to transform transfusion diagnostics, significantly reducing the cost of blood grouping in the donor and patient testing environments, while improving patient outcomes. 
 We have designed MosaiQ to offer a breadth of diagnostic tests that is unmatched by existing commercially available transfusion diagnostic instrument platforms. Time to result for MosaiQ is expected to be significantly quicker than existing methods for extended antigen typing and antibody detection and is expected to be equivalent to the time to result for current instrument platforms performing basic antigen typing. We believe that customer adoption of MosaiQ will lead to improved patient outcomes through better and easier matching of donor and patient blood, given cost-effective extended antigen typing offered by MosaiQ. Improved patient outcomes using MosaiQ include the potential for reduced incidence of alloimmunization, where the patient develops antibodies to foreign antigens introduced to the body through transfused blood. Cost savings and efficiencies should also be available to customers that adopt MosaiQ, as a result of: 
  
• | comprehensive characterization of donor or patient blood, eliminating the need for routine manual testing typically undertaken by skilled technicians;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | simplification of required consumables and testing processes;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | consolidation of multiple instrument platforms in donor testing laboratories;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | significant reduction of sample volume requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | reduction of consumable and reagent waste; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | more streamlined processes for matching donor units to patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

 We have designed MosaiQ to match the existing performance of automated platforms used by donor testing laboratories for serological disease screening. We also believe the incorporation of molecular disease screening on MosaiQ will offer considerable advantages over existing approaches in use by donor testing laboratories, delivering operational cost savings and a reduced time to result, while also eliminating the need to pool samples.
 Our aim is to provide donor testing laboratories with a single instrument platform to be utilized for blood grouping and, if applicable, both serological and molecular disease screening for donated red blood cells and plasma. Based on historical annual blood donations collected by our key target donor testing customers, we estimate that the potential market for MosaiQ microarrays (for blood grouping, serological disease screening and molecular disease screening) should exceed 100 million microarrays per annum following receipt of applicable regulatory clearances and approvals for MosaiQ.
 We have a proven track record and significant expertise in product development, manufacturing and quality assurance, tailored to the highly regulated transfusion diagnostics market. We currently derive revenue from a portfolio of products used for blood grouping, as well as whole blood controls used daily for quality assurance testing of third-party blood grouping instruments. We have introduced a range of FDA-licensed products in the United States under the Quotient brand, which we sell directly to donor testing laboratories, hospitals and independent patient testing laboratories. We also develop, manufacture and sell conventional reagent products to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, such as Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (or Ortho), Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (or Bio-Rad) and Grifols S.A. (or Grifols). In March 2017 the FDA licensed a range of conventional reagent products developed and manufactured by Quotient for use on instrument and semi manual testing platforms commercialized by Ortho.

On April 30, 2014, we completed our initial public offering and issued 5,000,000 units at $8.00 per unit. We raised net proceeds of $37.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, while other costs of the offering amounted to $3.6 million. Each unit comprised one ordinary share and one warrant and each warrant permitted the holder, prior to October 26, 2015, to subscribe for 0.8 of one new ordinary share at an exercise price equivalent to $8.80 per underlying ordinary share. On October 26, 2015, the warrants expired and were delisted. 4,981,052 warrants were exercised prior to the expiration date and 18,948 were cancelled on October 26, 2015. The exercise of the warrants resulted in the issuance of 3,984,823 ordinary shares and we received proceeds of $35.1 million. 
 On November 25, 2014, we entered into subscription agreements with certain institutional and individual accredited investors for the private placement of 2,000,000 newly issued ordinary shares at a price of $9.50 per share and 850,000 newly issued pre-funded warrants at a price of $9.49 per warrant, amounting to an aggregate subscription price of approximately $27.1 million. Each prefunded warrant permitted the holder to subscribe for one new ordinary share at an exercise price of $0.01 per pre-funded warrant. On July 19, 2016, we issued 850,000 ordinary shares following the exercise of the 850,000 pre-funded warrants. 
 On January 29, 2015, we entered into a subscription agreement with Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Finco S.Á.R.L., an affiliate of Ortho, for the private placement of 444,445 newly issued ordinary shares at a price of $22.50 per share and 666,665 newly issued 7% cumulative redeemable preference shares, of no par value, at a price of $22.50 per share, for an aggregate subscription price of approximately $25 million.
 On February 10, 2016, we completed a public offering of 4,444,445 newly issued ordinary shares at a price of $9.00 per share. The net proceeds from this offering were $36.8 million, net of underwriting discounts and other offering expenses.
 On August 3, 2016, we completed a public offering of 3,220,000 newly issued ordinary shares at a price of $5.50 per share.  The net proceeds from this offering were $16.3 million, net of underwriting discounts and other offering expenses. 
 On October 14, 2016, we completed the private placement of up to $120 million aggregate principal amount of 12% senior secured notes due 2023 (the “Secured Notes”) and entered into an indenture with the guarantors party thereto and U.S. Bank National Association, a national banking association, as trustee and collateral agent. We issued $84 million aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes on October 14, 2016 and, so long as no event of default has occurred, we will issue an additional $36 million aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes upon public announcement of field trial results for the MosaiQ IH Microarray that demonstrates greater than 99% concordance for the detection of blood group antigens and greater than 95% concordance for the detection of blood group antibodies when compared to predicate technologies for a pre-defined set of blood group antigens and antibodies. The net proceeds from the offering completed on October 14, 2016 were $78.5 million, after deducting offering expenses. We paid $5 million of these net proceeds into a cash reserve account maintained with the collateral agent under the terms of the indenture. We also used a portion of these net proceeds to repay all outstanding obligations under our previous secured term loan facility with MidCap Financial Trust, which amounted to $33.5 million including fees and expenses.
 On April 10, 2017, we completed a public offering of 8,050,000 newly issued ordinary shares at a price of $6.00 per share.  The net proceeds from this offering were $45.2 million, net of underwriting discounts and other offering expenses.
 Our Market Opportunity 
 The global transfusion diagnostics market is large and established. Total annual product sales in this market amounted to $3.4 billion in 2014, of which the United States accounted for $1.5 billion of sales. Product sales comprise the sale of reagents and instruments. In 2014, we believe blood grouping accounted for $1.2 billion of product sales, disease screening using serological methods accounted for $1.1 billion of sales and disease screening using molecular methods accounted for $1.1 billion of sales. We believe product sales in 2014 to the highly concentrated donor testing market accounted for approximately $2.2 billion of sales, while patient testing accounted for the remaining $1.2 billion of sales. Performed primarily within hospitals, the patient testing market is highly fragmented. 
 According to the World Health Organization, 54 million blood donations were collected globally in 2014 within “high-income” countries located in North America, Western Europe and Eastern Asia. In the United States, 17 million blood donations were collected during 2014, based on data from the American Association of Blood Bankers and the American Red Cross. In addition, over 20 million plasma donations are collected each year in the United States and Europe. While plasma is not subject to blood grouping, it is subject to disease screening. We estimate that over 90 million patients are blood grouped annually in the developed world, although only a small proportion of these patients actually receive a blood transfusion. 
 Combined, the cost of procuring and characterizing blood for transfusion represents a significant cost to the global healthcare system. The costs and expenses related to blood grouping and disease screening are typically included in the price a hospital pays for a unit of blood. In the United States, the average price paid by a hospital for a unit of red blood cells is approximately $225. Where a hospital requests units of blood with a specific antigen profile (for patients with blood group antibodies) the average price of those antigen

negative units of blood in the United States is estimated to increase by $80 for each antigen screened. The costs and expenses related to patient blood grouping at hospitals are not specifically reimbursed by a third party payor, but typically absorbed within the reimbursement structure of a broader medical procedure. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2014 laboratory fee schedule, the reimbursement rate for outpatient services associated with basic antigen typing and an antibody screen is $36 per sample. When an antibody screen is positive, an antibody identification procedure will be undertaken on the patient sample for which the reimbursement rate is an additional $92 per sample. 
 Blood grouping and disease screening techniques have remained generally unchanged for many years. Varying levels of automation are offered by existing instrument platforms, although more complex blood grouping procedures such as extended antigen typing and antibody identification are more typically undertaken manually. The need for ongoing routine manual testing continues to impose a significant cost burden on the healthcare system. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our strategy is focused on the development and commercialization of a range of consumables (or microarrays) to address the global transfusion diagnostics market.  Each microarray will incorporate existing, well characterized assays to undertake:

(i) | a comprehensive characterization of donor and patient blood, including extended antigen typing and antibody detection/identification. We expect there to be two blood grouping microarrays, one for the donor testing market and one for the patient testing market. We refer to the blood grouping microarrays as the MosaiQ IH Microarray; 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | all mandated serological disease screening tests for donor red blood cells or source plasma. We refer to the serological disease screening microarrays as the MosaiQ SDS Microarray. The initial MosaiQ SDS Microarray will comprise assays to detect CMV and Syphilis. We expect to follow our initial MosaiQ SDS Microarray launch with the launch of a range of additional MosaiQ SDS II Microarrays incorporating all remaining mandated serological disease screening assays, depending upon the final application for the product; and 
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | all mandated molecular disease screening tests for donor red cells or source plasma. We refer to the molecular disease screening microarray as the MosaiQ MDS Microarray. 
------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Together, we refer to the MosaiQ IH Microarray, MosaiQ SDS Microarray and MosaiQ MDS Microarray as MosaiQ Microarrays.
 We will manufacture the MosaiQ Microarrays at our state-of-the-art manufacturing facility located in Eysins, Switzerland.  Construction of the initial manufacturing system to produce MosaiQ Microarrays is now complete.  We expect to complete the final product qualification procedures for the first MosaiQ Microarray manufacturing system (comprising three key elements: (i) the print system; (ii) the wet process; and (iii) the final assembly system) in the second calendar quarter of 2017 and manufacture the initial MosaiQ IH Microarrays and MosaiQ SDS Microarrays for internal validation and field trials immediately thereafter.
 Development of assays for inclusion on the initial MosaiQ IH Microarray and MosaiQ SDS Microarray is now complete. We expect to complete the transfer of these assays to final manufacture in the second calendar quarter of 2017.
 Development of the MosaiQ Instrument is now complete, with formal validation expected to be completed prior to the commencement of field trials. We have now taken delivery of the first commercially ready MosaiQ Instrument.
 Pending regulatory approval, we intend to launch the MosaiQ IH Microarray and initial MosaiQ SDS Microarray into the European donor testing market and, with our commercial partner, Ortho, launch the MosaiQ IH Microarray into the European patient testing market (in each case, with the MosaiQ Instrument). We plan to follow this initial launch with: (i) a second MosaiQ IH Microarray comprising an expanded antigen typing panel for the donor testing market; (ii) a third MosaiQ IH Microarray comprising the extended antigen typing panel and an expanded antibody detection panel for the patient testing market; and (iii) the MosaiQ SDS II Microarray incorporating assays for the detection of CMV; Syphilis; Hepatitis B, or HBV, comprising HBV Surface Antigen and HBV Core Antibody; Hepatitis C, or HCV; human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, comprising HIV Type 1 and HIV Type 2; Human T-Lymphotropic Antibodies, or HTLV; and Chagas disease. 
 In Europe, the MosaiQ Microarrays will be subject to CE-marking and the instrument will be self-certified. In the United States, the FDA has indicated to us that the MosaiQ IH Microarray will be subject to a biologics license application, or BLA, and the MosaiQ instrument will be subject to a 510(k) filing. The initial MosaiQ SDS Microarray, comprising tests for CMV and Syphilis, will be subject to a 510(k) filing, while the MosaiQ SDS II Microarray will be subject to BLA approval. The MosaiQ Instrument is expected to be classified as a Class II medical device.
 We expect to commence field trials for both the MosaiQ IH Microarray and initial MosaiQ SDS Microarray in Europe around the middle of 2017. We expect to file necessary regulatory submissions for Europe in the second half of 2017 to obtain required marketing

clearances for the MosaiQ IH Microarray and the initial MosaiQ SDS Microarray. Field trials in the United States are expected to commence in the second half of 2017 and regulatory submissions are planned to be filed early in 2018 to obtain required marketing clearances in the United States. Field trials for the MosaiQ SDS II Microarray are expected to commence six to nine months after completion of the initial field trials for blood grouping in Europe and the United States. 
 In Europe, we are currently responding to invitations to tender by major government blood collection agencies.  First commercial sales will not, however, commence in Europe until receipt of CE-Marking for the MosaiQ IH Microarray and the MosaiQ SDS Microarray, which we believe could happen before the end of 2017. If approved for sale, we anticipate commercial launch in the United States in the first quarter of 2019. We also anticipate commercial launch of the MosaiQ SDS II Microarray in Europe during the first half of 2018 and in the United States in the second half of 2019, if approved for sale. 
 In addition, we intend to continue: 
  
• | to engage and collaborate with our key potential customers on the functionality of the MosaiQ system;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our dialogue with regulators to obtain required regulatory licenses and clearances;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to build a highly focused sales and support infrastructure to successfully commercialize MosaiQ for the donor testing market in North America, the European Union and certain territories in the Asia-Pacific region; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to collaborate with Ortho, our commercial partner for the global patient testing market. For additional information, see “—Sales, Marketing and Distribution—Ortho Clinical Diagnostics".
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In our conventional reagent business, where we recently obtained licenses to sell in the United States eight new rare antisera, we intend to continue to strengthen the Quotient brand, expand our customer base, reinforce our relationship with the FDA and other key regulators, continue to service our key OEM customers and expand the number of conventional reagent products we offer directly for sale in the United States. 
 Blood Grouping 
 Prior to blood transfusion, or when there is likelihood that a blood transfusion might be required, extensive blood grouping procedures are undertaken on patient and donor blood using in vitro diagnostic products. These procedures ascertain the blood group of the patient and ensure the compatibility of donor blood. The testing regime is designed to prevent transfusion reactions, which can range from mild to fatal. 
 Red blood cells (the cellular portion) and plasma (the fluid portion) are the principal components of blood. On the exterior of red blood cells are blood group antigens that determine an individual’s blood group (A, B, AB, O), or ABO group, and type (RhD positive or RhD negative), or Rh type. In addition, there are additional clinically significant blood group antigens that may be present on patient and donor red blood cells. Plasma contains many different kinds of proteins, including: (i) blood group antibodies, such as Anti-A and Anti-B; (ii) unexpected blood group antibodies developed by the body in response to foreign red blood cell antigens introduced during transfusion (alloantibodies); or (iii) blood group antibodies developed following pregnancy. Blood group antibodies mirror the antigen families that are present on red blood cells. In its normal state, blood does not contain antibodies that will react with its own red blood cell antigens (autoantibodies). 
 Because of the potential for a transfusion reaction, it is crucial that clinicians correctly identify the blood group antigens and antibodies present in donor and patient blood prior to transfusion. If a donor’s red blood cells contain antigens that are recognized by and react with existing blood group antibodies in the patient’s plasma, the transfused red blood cells could be destroyed in a potentially life-threatening reaction. The identification of blood group antigens on donor and patient red blood cells is typically referred to as blood typing or basic antigen typing, with a more comprehensive characterization being referred to as extended antigen typing. The identification of blood group antibodies in plasma is typically referred to as antibody identification. 
 All patients potentially requiring a blood transfusion will generally be blood grouped, including pregnant women, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, patients undergoing surgery or patients suffering from chronic diseases that require regular blood transfusions, such as thalassemia or sickle cell disease. 
 Patient blood will typically be subject to a basic antigen typing and an antibody screen. Less than 1% of patients that have not received a blood transfusion will screen positive for an antibody. The incidence of blood group antibodies, however, increases significantly to 3 to 8% in patients who have previously received a blood transfusion and women that have given birth to two or more children. When an antibody screen proves positive, a complex and time consuming procedure will be performed by skilled technicians to identify all clinically significant blood group antibodies in the patient’s plasma. This largely manual process may take two to six hours to complete, although more complex cases can take one or more days to complete. Antibody identification represents a significant cost to hospitals, particularly those that treat large numbers of chronically transfused patients. Reagents used for antibody identification also

have a short shelf life, typically being shipped on a 28-day cycle, making management of blood grouping reagent inventories more complex with increased waste. 
 The increasing incidence of alloantibodies developing in patients who have received multiple transfusions, commonly referred to as alloimmunization, has prompted clinicians to request costly, extended antigen matching of donor blood for at-risk patient groups, such as those suffering from thalassemia or sickle cell disease. The incidence of antibodies present in these patient groups is estimated to be 20 to 30%. These patients typically also present with multiple antibodies, making the process of antibody identification more complex and time consuming and the procurement of antigen specific units of donor blood much more expensive. 
 According to a study published in January 2014, the estimated total cost of extended antigen typing for patients is $364, based on a screen for 14 antigens at an estimated cost of $26 per antigen. 
 Donor blood will typically be subject to a basic antigen typing and an antibody screen. Clinicians will request specific antigen negative donor blood for patients with one or more blood group antibodies. In this instance, multiple donor units will be selected from inventory by the donor collection agency and subjected to an extended antigen typing procedure to identify the most appropriate units for the patient. This procedure is completed to ensure that the corresponding antigen to the patient’s antibody is not present on the donor’s red blood cells. 
 The number of donor units that need to be screened to identify specific antigen negative units varies depending upon blood group. In the Caucasian population, for example, ten donor units on average would need to be screened to find two units of donor blood negative for the Duffy-A antigen. Similarly, to identify two units of donor blood negative for the little-e antigen, one hundred donations would need to be screened and, to identify two units of blood negative for the little-k antigen one thousand donations would need to be screened. Additionally, the numbers of units needed to be screened increases significantly if the patient has two or more antibodies. 
 The identification of antigen negative units of blood is largely a manual and labor-intensive process. Because of the additional testing procedures required and the large numbers of donor units that must be screened, antigen negative donor units are more expensive for hospitals to purchase. The average premium charged for antigen negative units of blood in the United States is estimated to be $80 for each antigen screened. 
 We believe both donor collection agencies and hospitals would prefer to fully characterize donor units and patient blood through extended antigen typing prior to transfusion, although the time and expense required to undertake such procedures is currently prohibitive. As a consequence, extended antigen typing is only undertaken as needed (i.e., where the patient has a specific antibody) on a small percentage of donor units. Extended antigen typing for patients is also typically undertaken only in patients expected to be chronically transfused. 
 Disease Screening 
 The safety of donor red blood cells and source plasma is ultimately the responsibility of donor collection agencies, with regulatory agencies in individual countries establishing safeguards and standards to ensure patient safety. In the developed world, donor red blood cells and source plasma is subject to mandatory screening for infectious diseases before it can be released for transfusion or further manufacture. Two different methods of testing have been adopted—a serological approach (testing for specific antigens or antibodies) and, for certain viruses, a molecular approach (testing for DNA or RNA). The United States, many countries in Western Europe and Japan require both serological and molecular disease screening be performed on donor blood. In the United States, it is mandatory to screen donor blood using serological techniques for the following: Syphilis, HBV Surface Antigen, HBV Core Antibody, HCV Antibody, HIV Type 1 and Type 2 Antibodies and HTLV Antibodies. Most blood collection agencies will also screen for CMV, using the same serological approach and the FDA recommends donor blood to be screened for Chagas disease. Molecular disease screening is required to be performed on donated blood to screen for HBV, HCV, HIV, West Nile virus and Zika. Other pathogens, such as Babesia, Dengue and Malaria are transmissible by blood, but there is no test currently available, given cost or technology limitations. 
 Serological and molecular disease screening is already largely automated. However, it is typically undertaken using instrument platforms that are not integrated with commonly used blood grouping instruments. Automation platforms for serological disease screening have been on the market for many years, but lack many of the attributes users benefit from in other diagnostic fields, such as graphical user-interface, remote diagnostics, links to laboratory automation systems and software compatibility with laboratory information systems. Existing disease screening platforms also lack the ability to easily incorporate additional tests as the market and regulators dictate.

Donor Testing 
 In the developed world, the testing of donated blood is primarily completed by donor collection agencies. In the United States, two agencies, the American Red Cross and Creative Testing Solutions, test approximately 70% of all blood donations collected. Throughout Western Europe, Japan, Australia and Canada, national collection agencies, or a small number of regional collection agencies, typically collect and test all donated blood. Currently, donor testing laboratories must adopt multiple instrument platforms, as well as undertake complex manual testing procedures for extended antigen typing or antibody identification, to complete the required testing for donated blood. Maintaining multiple instrument platforms requires complex quality control and assurance procedures, along with costly service and support infrastructures. 
 Single instrument platforms for each testing procedure have typically been adopted within and across laboratory networks. In addition, donor testing laboratories typically utilize costly manual testing techniques to identify antigen negative donor units and to carry out any antibody identification procedures required. 
 Patient Testing 
 Patients are typically blood grouped in hospitals. Large-to-medium hospitals will generally adopt one of several semi-automated instrument platforms to perform basic blood grouping procedures. These instruments employ either column agglutination technology supplied by companies such as Ortho, Bio-Rad and Grifols, or solid-phase microplate technologies supplied by companies such as Immucor. These platforms offer only a limited number of blood grouping tests per testing run and are therefore cumbersome, especially if a more comprehensive characterization of the patient’s blood is required. Consequently, laboratories that have adopted a blood grouping instrument platform will continue to use manual or semi-manual techniques to undertake more complex procedures, such as antibody identification or extended antigen typing. 
 Because of the continued need for manual testing, many small to medium-sized hospitals choose not to adopt existing instrument platforms. Instead, they will use manual or semi-manual techniques for basic blood grouping. Complex procedures, such as antibody identification, may also be outsourced to independent testing laboratories by these hospitals. We believe the continued requirement for manual testing and drawbacks of existing instrument platforms for blood grouping have limited the attraction of offering blood grouping services to hospitals by large independent testing laboratories, such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics. 
 The MosaiQ Solution for Transfusion Diagnostics
 We are initially developing MosaiQ to address the comprehensive needs of the global transfusion diagnostics market. We believe MosaiQ has the potential to transform transfusion diagnostics by substantially reducing costs and offering a range of operational efficiencies within donor and patient testing laboratories, while improving patient outcomes through the more complete characterization of donor and patient blood. 
 Specifically, we are initially developing MosaiQ to: 
  
• | Comprehensively characterize donor and patient blood; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | Screen donor blood for specific viruses using serological and molecular methods.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We intend to pursue a “razor/razor blade” business model for MosaiQ, placing MosaiQ Instruments and securing long-term agreements for the supply of MosaiQ IH Microarrays and/or MosaiQ SDS Microarrays and MosaiQ MDS Microarrays used by those instruments. We expect donor and patient laboratories to adopt MosaiQ because it is designed to offer a comprehensive characterization of clinically significant blood group antigens and antibodies, while also offering the opportunity for substantial cost savings and a range of operational efficiencies. We believe these customers would prefer to more fully characterize the blood of all donors and patients to facilitate better blood matching. While MosaiQ is designed to be a highly cost-effective solution for our customers, delivering substantial cost savings, we also expect to generate attractive, long-term profit margins on the sale of MosaiQ Microarrays. 
 We have designed MosaiQ leveraging our expertise in transfusion diagnostics. MosaiQ combines novel manufacturing techniques and well-characterized blood grouping and disease screening tests to create multiplex testing microarrays for use on a high-throughput instrument, the MosaiQ Instrument. Through miniaturization, we are combining a full portfolio of existing serological tests on two distinct microarrays for use on MosaiQ – one for blood grouping (the MosaiQ IH Microarray) and one for serological disease screening (the MosaiQ SDS Microarray or the MosaiQ™ SDS II Microarray). We are also developing a third microarray for molecular disease screening (the MosaiQ MDS Microarray).  We expect there to be multiple variants of each microarray depending upon the stage of development and the end markets in which we expect the MosaiQ Microarrays will be adopted. 
 - 7 -

In a donor testing environment, the MosaiQ IH Microarray and the MosaiQ SDS Microarray have been designed to run simultaneously, utilizing the same donor sample and the same MosaiQ Instrument. The MosaiQ MDS Microarray would also be utilized in a donor testing environment. In a patient testing environment, only MosaiQ IH Microarrays would be utilized.
 Our novel approach incorporates existing, well-characterized tests for blood group antigens and antibodies on a single consumable for the global market. Each MosaiQ IH Microarray will consist of two microarrays – one for antigen typing (comprising printed monoclonal antibodies) and one for antibody detection/identification (comprising printed human red blood cells). We believe MosaiQ, when launched, will be the only commercially available automation platform capable of offering this breadth of testing on a single consumable. 
 The MosaiQ SDS Microarray is being designed to incorporate all tests required to meet current regulatory requirements for serological disease screening of donor blood and source plasma in the markets in which we intend to operate. We are including tests to screen serologically for Syphilis, HBV, HCV, HIV and HTLV, along with tests for CMV and Chagas disease. The MosaiQ SDS Microarray has additional capacity to incorporate further serological disease screening tests should it be necessary in the future. 
 The MosaiQ MDS Microarray is being designed to incorporate all mandated tests required to meet current regulatory requirements for molecular disease screening for donor blood and source plasma in the markets in which we intend to operate. We are including molecular tests to screen for HBV, HCV, HIV, West Nile virus and Zika. 
 MosaiQ Microarrays will be manufactured using a novel, patented printing technology we have further developed with TTP plc, or TTP, a leading European technology development company. This print technology enables us to industrialize the manufacture of MosaiQ Microarrays. We are not aware of any alternative technology suitable and commercially available for this purpose.
 We have developed a high-throughput, floor standing MosaiQ Instrument for use by both donor collection agencies and medium to large-sized hospitals. The MosaiQ Instrument is being designed to process up to 3,000 microarrays per day (assuming three eight-hour shifts), giving a capacity to test up to 1,500 donor samples (utilizing a MosaiQ IH Microarray and a MosaiQ SDS Microarray) or 3,000 patient samples (utilizing MosaiQ IH Microarrays only). The MosaiQ Instrument is expected to complete the comprehensive characterization of donor or patient blood in less than 35 minutes and to have the capability to prioritize urgent patient sample testing, commonly referred to as STAT testing. 
 The MosaiQ Instrument is designed to fully automate blood grouping and perform a simultaneous serological disease screen in a donor testing laboratory. Consistent with the typical workflow of donor or patient testing laboratories, centrifuged tubes of whole blood will be placed on the MosaiQ Instrument for processing. The instrument will then complete a comprehensive blood group characterization of each sample, combined with a parallel serological disease screen in a donor testing environment, with the results being reported through existing laboratory information management systems (or LIMS). 
 We have partnered with STRATEC, a leading global developer of diagnostics instruments, to design, develop and manufacture the MosaiQ Instrument. STRATEC has been operating for over 30 years and has significant experience designing, developing and manufacturing in vitro diagnostics instruments, including a number of existing instruments used today for blood grouping and disease screening. We expect to take delivery of the first commercially ready MosaiQ Instruments in the second calendar quarter of 2017. 
 We are also collaborating with key potential donor and patient testing customers on the development of MosaiQ. This group includes the American Red Cross and Creative Testing Solutions, along with several other major hospitals, donor collection organizations and reference laboratories. 
 Our Conventional Reagent Business 
 We have over 30 years of experience in the development, manufacturing and commercialization of conventional reagent products for blood grouping. Our conventional reagent products are used primarily to identify blood group antigens and antibodies in donor and patient blood and to perform daily quality assurance testing for third-party blood grouping instrument platforms. We also undertake product development projects for our OEM customers, generating product development fees. Following development, we enter into long-term supply contracts with our OEM customers to manufacture and supply the products we have developed.

 We manufacture our conventional reagent products at our Edinburgh, Scotland manufacturing facility using our own cell lines or from raw materials purchased from a limited number of suppliers. We believe we have good relationships with our suppliers. We plan to replace and expand our existing facility in Edinburgh for the development and manufacture of conventional reagent products. The new facility is currently under construction and we expect to relocate to the new facility before the end of 2018. 
 Our Customers 
 In the United States, we currently offer directly to our customers a portfolio of 40 conventional reagent products focused on blood grouping and we have over 17 additional products at various stages of development or FDA licensing. Conventional reagent products sold in the United States under the Quotient brand include antisera products, reagent red blood cells and other ancillary products. We currently serve over 800 hospitals, donor collection agencies and independent testing laboratory customers throughout the United States. Global direct sales, including sales to distributors, accounted for 29% of our product sales in the year ended March 31, 2017 and 32% in the year ended March 31, 2016. 
 We sell the majority of our conventional reagent products to our OEM customers for use with their blood grouping instruments as specific tests or controls. Products sold to OEM customers range from bulk material incorporated into the customer’s own products to finished, vialled products sold under our customer’s label. We retain ownership of the intellectual property for these finished, vialled products and their associated regulatory licenses. OEM customers accounted for 71% of product sales in the year ended March 31, 2017 and 68% in the year ended March 31, 2016. We have long-standing relationships with three leading global transfusion diagnostics companies: Ortho, Bio-Rad and Grifols. 
 We have developed several conventional reagent products launched by Ortho over the past five years. As a result, Ortho accounted for 61% and 57% of our product sales in the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We are currently developing a range of rare antisera products for use on Ortho’s instrument platforms. In May 2013, the first 14 of these products received CE-Marking for sale in Europe. We filed a BLA to obtain FDA approval for these products in 2014 and eight of the 14 products have now been approved by the FDA. We also sell a range of whole blood control products, red blood cell products and ancillary products to Ortho worldwide, many of which have been launched over the past five years. 
 MosaiQ Manufacturing and Supply 
 We have leased a facility in Eysins, Switzerland (near Geneva), which will become the initial manufacturing site for MosaiQ Microarrays. Conversion of this facility to manufacture MosaiQ Microarrays has now been finished and we have completed the installation of the first manufacturing system for MosaiQ Microarrays. We expect to complete final product qualification procedures for the first MosaiQ Microarray manufacturing system in the second calendar quarter of 2017.
 TTP plc (“TTP”)
 We entered into a master development agreement with TTP to design, build, install and validate the initial manufacturing system for the MosaiQ Microarrays being installed at our Eysins, Switzerland facility. TTP agreed to certain development work programs for each phase of the design and build process and we agreed to pay for all development costs, including costs of materials, third party costs and specified professional fees for the time of TTP’s engineers and scientists. The agreement does not have a defined term and will terminate following completion of product qualification procedures for the initial MosaiQ Microarray manufacturing system. Either party may terminate the agreement for certain breaches by the other party or in the event of certain bankruptcy events involving the other party. In addition, we may terminate the agreement upon 30 days’ notice for any reason. Upon termination of the agreement, we are responsible for paying any unpaid development and other costs of TTP. 
 We have entered into an exclusive, royalty-bearing, worldwide license with TTP to certain patented technologies and trade secrets to enable high volume manufacturing of MosaiQ Microarrays. Pursuant to this license agreement, we are paying TTP a $10 million license fee (the TTP License Fee), which is payable in installments through September 30, 2021. The first installment was paid in March 2015 and the second installment was paid in December 2016.

human blood sample diagnostic testing on batch processing instruments (collectively, the additional purposes), with the exception of companion diagnostics, epigenetics and nucleic acid sequencing. We will pay a low single digit royalty to TTP based on our net sales for 20 years or for so long as the licensed intellectual property is protected by patent in the country of sale. If the TTP License Fee payments are not made by us when due, we will lose the license to the additional purposes, but not to the initial purpose. 
 TTP has also granted us a non-exclusive, fully paid, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide license to use certain other intellectual property TTP owns and has incorporated into bespoke components of the manufacturing system for MosaiQ Microarrays. The agreement will remain in effect so long as the licensed intellectual property is subject to patent or other intellectual property protection. TTP may terminate the agreement if we assist another party in disputing the validity and/or scope of any of TTP’s patented intellectual property covered by the agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement with immediate effect by notice to the other party upon the occurrence of bankruptcy events. Any fee disputes are subject to mandatory dispute resolution. 
 STRATEC Biomedical AG (“STRATEC”)
 We entered into a development agreement with STRATEC pursuant to which it has developed a high-throughput instrument for MosaiQ, The MosaiQ Instrument. STRATEC agreed to a project development timeline that runs through the end of 2017. STRATEC’s fees under this agreement total €13.1 million in aggregate, or $14.0 million using exchange rates on March 31, 2017, payable upon completion of pre-agreed project development milestones. As of March 31, 2017, we have incurred expenses related to this agreement totaling €12.4 million, or $13.2 million, using exchange rates on March 31, 2017. The agreement does not have a defined term. Either party may also terminate the agreement for certain breaches by the other party or in the event of certain bankruptcy events involving the other party. Upon termination by STRATEC in connection with our breach or bankruptcy, certain termination payments are payable by us depending upon the stage of completion of the development program at the time of termination, and we are also responsible for certain costs. 
 We have also entered into a manufacturing agreement with STRATEC pursuant to which we will be required to purchase a fixed minimum number of MosaiQ Instruments during the six years following delivery of the first field trial instruments (the sixth development milestone). Our aggregate obligation under this agreement will total €51.8 million, or $55.3 million using exchange rates on March 31, 2017. The agreement is terminable by either party for certain breaches by the other party or in the event of certain bankruptcy events involving the other party. If STRATEC terminates the manufacturing agreement, certain termination payments are payable by us depending upon the number of the instruments purchased at the time of termination, and we are also responsible for certain costs. 
 Pursuant to the development agreement, STRATEC has granted us an irrevocable, fully-paid, perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide license to intellectual property that is developed for use by, or the manufacture of, the MosaiQ Instrument, as well as an exclusive right to market and sell the MosaiQ Instrument. STRATEC has additionally granted us, or agreed to grant, similar rights to its pre-existing technologies for use in development and manufacturing activities for the MosaiQ Instrument. We may only exercise our rights to manufacture in limited circumstances when STRATEC fails to perform under the manufacturing agreement and such rights are subject to a to be negotiated license fee. Upon termination of the development agreement by STRATEC, the licenses granted under the development agreement will be null and void. 
 SCHOTT Technical Glass Solutions GmbH 
 On March 27, 2014, we entered into a supply agreement with SCHOTT Technical Glass Solutions GmbH, or SCHOTT, pursuant to which we would purchase €10 million of coated glass in connection with the development and manufacture of the MosaiQ Microarrays through December 2017. The total purchase obligation remaining under this agreement at March 31, 2017 was €1.5 million, or $1.6 million using exchange rates on March 31, 2017. 
 Quality 
 Our quality function (composed of quality assurance, quality control and validation) oversees the quality of our manufacturing as well as the quality systems used in research and development and sales and marketing. We have established a control system that oversees implementation and maintenance, document control, supplier qualification, corrective and preventative actions, as well as employee training processes that we believe ensures quality across our operations. We continuously monitor and seek to improve quality over time and believe the implementation of these processes has supported product performance, customer satisfaction, and a culture of continuous improvement. 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
 We market our conventional reagent products directly in the United States. Outside of this territory, we sell our products to a range of third-party distributors and customers. In the United States, we use a combination of sales managers, sales representatives, customer 
 - 10 -

service staff and technical experts to interact with laboratory managers and administrative staff, purchasing directors, medical directors and other individuals and groups involved in the implementation of blood testing programs. Our goal is to educate these groups about the technical and economic benefits of switching from competing offerings to our products. Our customer service staff and technical experts are also involved in the practical training of customers, as well as answering customer questions. These teams are supported by various marketing activities, which include advertising, medical education, attendance at scientific meetings and other awareness-raising activities. As of March 31, 2017, we had 14 employees engaged worldwide in sales, marketing and customer service functions for the conventional reagents business. 
 Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics 
 On January 29, 2015, we entered into a distribution and supply agreement with Ortho (the Ortho Agreement) to sell and distribute MosaiQ Microarrays within the $3.4 billion global transfusion diagnostics market. We have retained all rights to commercialize MosaiQ in North America, the European Union and certain Asia-Pacific territories (excluding Japan) for the donor testing market. Pursuant to the Ortho Agreement, and for an initial term of 20 years, Ortho will exclusively commercialize MosaiQ for the global patient testing market (for blood grouping), as well as the donor testing market (for blood grouping and donor disease screening) in territories other than those in which we will commercialize MosaiQ. We will be responsible for the manufacture of all products (instruments, MosaiQ Microarrays and ancillary products) associated with MosaiQ and have retained all other commercial rights to MosaiQ. Ortho has a right of first offer where we decide to commercialize MosaiQ with a third party for an application other than blood grouping. We have also agreed with Ortho to explore opportunities to develop and commercialize MosaiQ in other diagnostics applications outside of blood grouping and serological disease screening, utilizing the combined knowledge and expertise of both parties.  
 Ortho has agreed to pay us certain one-time payments upon the achievement of regulatory and commercial milestones totaling in the aggregate $59 million. These milestones primarily relate to the approval and launch of MosaiQ in the United States and the European Union for blood grouping. Ortho has also agreed to reimburse us for the cost of goods sold incurred for MosaiQ Instruments and associated replacement parts sold to Ortho, as well as the cost of ancillary products sold to Ortho. A transfer price mechanism for MosaiQ IH Microarrays and MosaiQ SDS Microarrays sold to Ortho has also been established, which will increase as a percentage of net sales based on agreed-upon revenue milestones. In addition, a basis for calculating minimum transfer prices for MosaiQ IH M Microarrays, instruments and ancillary products has also been agreed. 
 As part of the exclusive sale and distribution rights granted to Ortho for the MosaiQ Instruments and MosaiQ Microarrays (which rights are non-assignable except as provided for in the distribution and supply agreement) we have granted to Ortho: (i) an exclusive, license to use the “MosaiQ” trademark; (ii) access to CE-Mark, biologics license application and 510(k) clearances and other dossiers to be filed or that are approved by regulatory authorities for the MosaiQ Instrument, MosaiQ Microarrays and ancillary products; (iii) access to other confidential information; and (iv) intellectual property rights controlled by the Company as well as intellectual property rights granted to us by STRATEC and TTP, and rights we may control in the future, which are necessary or reasonably useful for the sale and distribution of MosaiQ Instruments and MosaiQ Microarrays and are freely licensable or sub-licensable and free of royalty or other payments (unless Ortho agrees to pay any such royalties or payments). Ortho may not use these intellectual property rights and information to manufacture the MosaiQ Instrument or MosaiQ Microarrays, supply serological screening microarrays to the patient testing market, or to carry out research and development, other than with our consent or pursuant to the distribution and supply agreement. Ortho will grant us a license for the term of the distribution and supply agreement for any know how related to the MosaiQ Instrument and MosaiQ Microarrays that Ortho generates during the course of the distribution and supply agreement, which is necessary or useful for the development, use or sale of the MosaiQ Instrument and MosaiQ Microarrays, or components thereof, or for us to provide maintenance and support.
 Research and Development 
 Our research and development efforts are focused on the development of MosaiQ and new conventional reagent products. We believe we have assembled an experienced research and development team with the scientific talent needed to develop new products that leverage our significant blood grouping expertise. We believe our experience in developing tests based on existing serological testing methods will allow us to conceive, develop and validate comprehensive multiplex tests utilizing MosaiQ. 
 As of March 31, 2017, we had 193 employees engaged in research and development functions. 
 Customer Funding and Reimbursement 
 In the United States, our products are not directly subject to reimbursement by governmental or commercial third party payors for health care services. The costs and expenses related to donor blood grouping and disease screening are typically included in the price to a hospital of a unit of blood. The costs and expenses related to patient blood grouping at hospitals are not specifically reimbursed by a third party payor, but absorbed within the reimbursement structure of a broader medical procedure. We supply products to our 
 - 11 -

customers, including hospitals, donor testing laboratories, independent testing laboratories and OEM customers based on negotiated prices. 
 Competition 
 In the past 10 to 15 years, the transfusion diagnostics market has experienced considerable consolidation, particularly in the United States. Given significant barriers to entry, there are only a small number of vendors currently addressing this market. These vendors can be divided into four groups: (i) those offering instrument platforms for blood grouping and related microarrays, in addition to conventional reagent products for manual testing; (ii) those only offering conventional reagent products for manual blood grouping; (iii) those offering raw materials for inclusion in products used on instrument platforms for blood grouping and in conventional reagent products; and (iv) those offering instruments for disease screening and related microarrays. A small number of donor collection agencies continue to manufacture a limited range of products, primarily for internal use. 
 In our view, barriers to entry for the transfusion diagnostics market include: 
  
• | the need to manufacture a broad range of complex antisera products, with annual volume requirements ranging from hundreds of milliliters to hundreds of liters, depending upon individual blood group specificities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the ability to reliably procure and formulate red blood cell donations with the appropriate antigen profiles to support the manufacture of red blood cells for antibody identification and whole blood control products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | rigorous global regulatory requirements; and
--+---------------------------------------------


• | customers who can be reluctant to change product suppliers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 Our principal competitors in the United States are Immucor, Ortho and Grifols. The principal market participants in Europe are Bio-Rad, Ortho, Grifols and Immucor and the principal market participants in Japan are Ortho and Immucor. 
 For serological disease screening, only two vendors have instruments approved for sale in the United States – Abbott and Ortho. Outside the United States, Abbott, Ortho, Roche and Bio-Rad are the principal instrument providers for serological disease screening.
 For molecular disease screening, only two vendors have instruments approved for sale in the United States – Grifols and Roche. Outside the United States, Grifols and Roche are the principal instrument providers for molecular disease screening. 
 For products sold to OEM customers, the cost of switching vendors (raw material and/or finished costs) can be considerable, given regulatory scrutiny of the manufacturing process and the potential need to modify instrument platforms and software. For our OEM business, we consider Merck/Millipore and Diagast to be our primary competitors. We are also a customer of each of these two organizations. We believe the complexity and high cost of switching suppliers, together with our ownership of key products and associated regulatory licenses, reduce the risk of loss of our important OEM business. We believe the FDA-licensed status of our manufacturing facility also offers major benefits as our key OEM clients seek to either establish or defend their position in the United States market. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We have relied, and expect to continue to rely, on various exclusive and non-exclusive license agreements, granting rights to patent-protected technologies relating to the manufacture of MosaiQ Microarrays and instruments. We have entered into an exclusive license with TTP to patented technologies to enable high volume manufacture of MosaiQ Microarrays. In addition, STRATEC has agreed to grant us licenses to certain of its pre-existing technologies and has granted us licenses to technologies developed under our development agreement with it, for use in the sale of MosaiQ instruments, and in the development and manufacture of the MosaiQ instrument, which it will undertake on our behalf. See “Business— MosaiQ Manufacturing and Supply—TTP plc” and “—STRATEC Biomedical AG” for additional information about these agreements. These licenses are material to the development and commercialization of MosaiQ. The remaining lives of the patents for key existing technologies that we have licensed currently exceed 10 years. 
 We have an issued U.S. patent related to blood typing that expires in September 2027. This patent provides methods of detecting the presence of red blood cells coated (or sensitized) with host antibody and/or components of the complement system. We received counterpart patents for this U.S. patent in Europe, Australia and Japan, which also expire in September 2027, and filed a counterpart patent application in Canada in September 2007, which is currently pending.
 In February 2014, we filed a new UK patent application providing for a new method for detecting red blood cells, also using MosaiQ. The technology finds particular application in immunological assays where it can be used as the basis of positive controls to confirm the addition of red blood cells. 
 - 12 -

We also rely upon copyright protection, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes, to preserve our copyrights and trade secrets, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. 
 We have developed several conventional reagent products launched by Ortho over the past five years. We generally retain ownership of the intellectual property for these products and their associated regulatory licenses. 
 Government Regulation 
 In the United States, medical products are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of medical products. Prior to marketing certain medical products, manufacturers are required to obtain permission from the FDA via a product approval or clearance. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to file submissions, refusal to approve or clear products, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, field actions, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, refusal to permit the importation of product, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. 
 The FDA regulates in vitro diagnostic, or IVD, products intended to evaluate blood as either biological products or medical devices. In general, reagents used to identify blood types, including extended antigen typing, and detect and identify antibodies in plasma, as well as assays intended for disease screening of the blood supply are regulated as biological products, while the instruments that conduct the analyses and quality assurance products intended to test the accuracy of instrument platforms are regulated as medical devices. 
 The European Commission is the legislative body responsible for directives with which manufacturers selling medical products in the European Union and the European Economic Area, or EEA, must comply. The European Union includes most of the major countries in Europe, while other countries, such as Switzerland, are not part of the EEA and have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that generally mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices. The European Union has adopted directives that address regulation of the design, manufacture, labeling, clinical studies and post-market vigilance for medical devices, including IVDs. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive, including the IVD Directive (Directive 98/79 EC), will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be marketed throughout the European Union and EEA. 
 Outside of the United States and the European Union, regulatory pathways for the marketing of medical devices vary greatly from country to country. In many countries, local regulatory agencies conduct an independent review of IVD medical devices prior to granting marketing approval. The process in these countries may be lengthy and require the expenditure of significant resources, including the conduct of clinical trials. In other countries, the regulatory pathway may be shorter and/or less costly. The timeline for the introduction of new IVD medical devices is heavily impacted by these various regulations on a country-by-country basis, which may become more lengthy and costly over time. 
 Environmental Matters 
 Our operations require the use of hazardous materials, which, among other matters, subjects us to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements, including those relating to the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of biological and hazardous materials and wastes. The primary hazardous materials we handle or use include human blood samples and solvents. Some of the regulations under the current regulatory structure provide for strict liability, holding a party liable for contamination at currently and formerly owned, leased and operated sites and at third-party sites without regard to fault or negligence.
