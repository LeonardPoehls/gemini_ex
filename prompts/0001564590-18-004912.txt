 Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel, local therapies for the treatment of patients with musculoskeletal conditions, beginning with osteoarthritis, or OA, a type of degenerative arthritis. On October 6, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved ZILRETTA® (triamcinolone acetonide extended-release injectable suspension), as the first and only extended-release, intra-articular, or IA (meaning in the joint), injection indicated for the management of OA pain of the knee. ZILRETTA is a non-opioid therapy that employs our proprietary microsphere technology to provide pain relief over 12 weeks. We established a full field sales force of Musculoskeletal Business Managers (MBMs) following ZILRETTA’s approval. The MBMs were trained, certified and deployed in the field as of November 20, 2017, when they began the process of informing and educating prescribing clinicians about ZILRETTA.  
 ZILRETTA combines a commonly administered steroid, triamcinolone acetonide, or TA, with poly lactic-co-glycolic acid, referred to as PLGA, delivering a 32 mg dose of TA to provide extended therapeutic concentrations in the joint and persistent analgesic effect. Both the magnitude and duration of pain relief provided by ZILRETTA in clinical trials were clinically meaningful with the magnitude of pain relief amongst the largest seen to date in OA clinical trials. ZILRETTA is not intended for repeat administration, as the efficacy and safety of repeat administration of ZILRETTA have not been evaluated. The overall frequency of treatment-related adverse events in these trials was similar to those observed with placebo and no drug-related serious adverse events were reported. 
 Based on the strength of our pivotal and other clinical trials, we believe that ZILRETTA represents an important new treatment option for the millions of patients in the U.S. who are in need of safe and effective extended relief from OA knee pain.  ZILRETTA is uniquely distinguished by the following attributes:

--+------------------------------------------------

 In summary, ZILRETTA has demonstrated significant, durable relief for OA knee pain and, as such, addresses an important unmet need among patients, physicians and healthcare payers.   We believe that ZILRETTA has the potential to be prescribed as a first-line IA medicine for OA knee pain.  
 OA is a type of degenerative arthritis that is caused by the progressive breakdown and eventual loss of cartilage in one or more joints. Arthritis is the most common cause of disability in the United States and OA is the most common joint disease, affecting more than 30 million Americans, and these numbers are expected to grow as a result of aging, obesity and sports injuries. OA commonly affects large weight-bearing joints like the knees and hips, but also occurs in the shoulders, hands, feet and spine. Patients with OA suffer from joint pain, tenderness, stiffness and limited movement. As the disease progresses, it becomes increasingly painful and debilitating, culminating, in many cases, in the need for total joint arthroplasty, or TJA.
 Because there is no cure for OA, controlling pain and delaying surgery are the primary goals of prescribing clinicians. Oral drugs, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, including COX II inhibitors, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs, as well as topical NSAIDs, are used to treat early-stage OA pain but have limited effect and, given the amount and frequency of use in OA patients, are associated with serious side effects. For example, NSAIDs have shown increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Furthermore, this class of drugs can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, ulceration and perforation of the stomach or intestines. These serious side effects are particularly worrisome because OA patients often have co-existing medical conditions, including diabetes and hypertension. For patients with moderate to severe OA pain, IA medicines, such as immediate-release steroids and hyaluronic acid, or HA, injected into the joint, are generally considered well-tolerated, but they leave the joint rapidly and often fail to produce or maintain clinically meaningful pain relief. Physicians may prescribe opioids, which in addition to the serious risk of addiction and abuse, have numerous serious side effects including respiratory depression, hypotension, constipation, cardiac events and, increasingly, deaths from unintentional overdose. As a result of these limitations, many OA patients experience persistent and worsening pain, which often culminates in the decision to have TJA, a painful and expensive procedure. Further, because the initial joint replacement wears out over time, the younger the patient is at the time of the joint replacement, the more likely it is that he or she will require repeat surgery in their lifetime.
 According to IQVIA, in 2016 approximately 5 million patients in the United States received an IA injection treatment for knee OA with approximately 4.3 million of these patients being treated with immediate-release steroids. Furthermore, despite negative guidance from prominent medical societies, including the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons and Osteoarthritis Research Society International that hyaluronic acid (HA) is an ineffective treatment for knee OA, and the growing number of payers that no longer reimburse for the entire class of HA products, HA sales in the United States were approximately $977 million in 2017, with a cost per treatment ranging from $430 to $1,300. Our market research indicates that, given the limitations of immediate-release steroids and HA, physicians are open to new treatment options which can provide their patients with extended pain relief. 
 Our pipeline includes FX101 and FX201.  FX101 is a PLGA-based extended-release formulation of fluticasone, a well-established corticosteroid, which aims to provide at least six months of pain relief from OA of large joints.  FX101 is a pre-clinical stage program.  The results of our ongoing and planned early studies will inform our decision on the next steps of the development process.  FX201 is a gene therapy candidate designed to stimulate the production of an anti-inflammatory protein, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), with the goal of providing at least one year of pain relief from OA of the knee. Based on its mechanism of action, we believe FX201 also has the potential to possibly arrest disease progression. FX201 is also a pre-clinical stage program, and subject to positive data from our ongoing and planned early studies and the initiation and successful completion of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology studies, we plan to file an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) in 2019.

We have worldwide commercialization rights for ZILRETTA and our product candidates, FX101 and FX201. We also have an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Southwest Research Institute, or SwRI®, with respect to the use of SwRI’s proprietary microsphere manufacturing technologies for certain steroids formulated with PLGA, including ZILRETTA. Our PLGA formulation technology is protected through a combination of patents, trade secrets, and proprietary know-how, and we intend to seek marketing exclusivity for any approved products.  In addition, we own or have rights to various trademarks, copyrights and trade names used in our business, including FLEXIONTM and ZILRETTA®.  Our logos and trademarks are the property of Flexion Therapeutics, Inc.  All other brand names or trademarks appearing in this report are the property of their respective holders. Use or display by us of other parties’ trademarks, trade dress, or products in this report is not intended to, and does not, imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us, by the trademark or trade dress owners.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to cost-effectively develop and commercialize novel, locally administered medicines that can safely and effectively address significant unmet medical needs. The principal elements of our strategy include the following:

• | Focus initially on novel biopharmaceutical candidates that provide long-lasting analgesia locally while minimizing the potential for systemic side effects. We are currently focusing on anti-inflammatory and analgesic therapies for the treatment of patients with musculoskeletal conditions, beginning with OA. Many OA patients will eventually require IA injection therapies to control their pain as the disease progresses. Immediate-release IA steroids leave the joint rapidly and typically fail to confer pain relief of sufficient magnitude or duration. Since, by medical practice, steroids are not injected more frequently than every three months, patients can experience a recurrence in, or increasing, pain during that time. While some patients may obtain benefit from HA injections, they are not recommended for OA pain by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) based on a lack of efficacy. ZILRETTA was specifically designed to provide persistent and effective OA pain relief with an acceptable safety profile. It is formulated using our proprietary PLGA-based microsphere technology to slowly and continuously release drug in the joint for over 12 weeks, avoiding significant plasma concentrations of drug.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build a robust pipeline of additional locally administered therapies to address musculoskeletal conditions. We seek to build a pipeline of additional product candidates and to mitigate development risk by selecting product candidates that have at least demonstrated efficacy in animal models of disease or have validated mechanisms of action. In 2017, we established the Flexion Innovation Lab in Woburn, Massachusetts to support our development activities, including our two active pipeline programs, FX101 and FX201. We aim to further build the pipeline through internal development and the selective addition of external opportunities. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Retain commercial rights in the United States and selectively partner outside of the United States. Because IA therapies in the United States are administered by a relatively small number of specialists, particularly orthopedists and rheumatologists, we believe that we can effectively commercialize ZILRETTA in the United States with our own sales and marketing organization, and thereby retain more of the commercial value of this product. We established a full field sales force of MBMs following ZILRETTA’s approval on October 6, 2017. The MBMs were trained, certified and deployed in the field as of November 20, 2017, when they began the process of informing and educating prescribing clinicians about ZILRETTA. While we believe that the United States represents the most attractive market for ZILRETTA, we continue to evaluate opportunities and potential partnerships to develop and commercialize ZILRETTA in territories outside the United States where we believe there is the potential for value-based pricing and reimbursement.

Osteoarthritis
 Overview
 OA, also referred to as degenerative joint disease, is the most common joint disease in the United States according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, affecting more than 30 million Americans. These numbers are only expected to grow in the years ahead as a result of aging, obesity and sports injuries.

• | With the U.S. population between the ages of 45 and 64 having grown 32% from 2000 through 2010 and accounting for 26% of the total population, we expect changing demographics will likely contribute to a growing number of OA patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approximately 35% of U.S. adults are obese, which increases the risk of developing OA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Knee injury is common, particularly amongst young athletes, and increases the risk of developing OA later in life by more than fivefold.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | OA accounts for over $185 billion of annual healthcare expenditures, which does not include loss of productivity costs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As reported in an Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) white paper (Nov 2016), “subjects in the US with symptomatic radiographic knee OA were 23% more likely to die prematurely than people free from OA independent of age, sex, and race”.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As an example, one in two Americans is expected to develop symptomatic knee OA, the most common form of OA, during their lifetime, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Recent research estimates that the average age of physician-diagnosed knee OA has fallen by 16 years, from age 72 in the 1990s to age 56 in the 2010s. According to the same research, Americans between the ages of 35 and 84 in the early 2010s will account for approximately 6.5 million new cases of knee OA over the next decade.
 OA is a progressive disease for which there is no cure. As a result, current treatments are intended to address the symptoms of OA, in particular, relief of pain and improvement in functional status. The therapeutic regimen for OA becomes increasingly invasive with progression of the disease, culminating, in many cases, in TJA. In addition, because patients are being diagnosed with OA earlier in their lives, many patients will require repeat TJAs. Because the decision to have TJA is based in large part on intractable pain and functional impairment, we believe that the development of new therapies which can meaningfully and durably relieve pain and improve function could potentially delay TJA.
 Common Treatments for OA
 In early-stage disease, treatment begins with non-pharmacologic therapy including exercise, weight control and physical therapy. As the disease progresses, physicians prescribe pharmacologic therapy, beginning with acetaminophen and progressing to oral NSAIDs, including COX II inhibitors, topical NSAIDs or SNRIs. Physicians may also treat OA pain with opioids, which are prescribed to approximately 50% of patients suffering from OA pain.  However, they have very serious drawbacks and are generally considered to be a suboptimal therapy for chronic non-cancer pain, like that associated with osteoarthritis.  
 When non-pharmacologic therapy and oral pain medications prove inadequate, physicians typically transition patients to IA injections. Immediate-release steroids have historically served as the first line IA therapy, and when these no longer provide sufficiently durable pain relief, patients may progress to IA HA, a significantly more expensive therapy with only marginally greater effect than placebo. TA, the corticosteroid used in ZILRETTA, is amongst the most commonly prescribed IA corticosteroid injections. 
 Due to severe pain that can no longer be controlled therapeutically, many patients opt to have TJA, which is costly and painful. One of the most prevalent TJA procedures in the United States is total knee arthroplasty. Compared to existing drug therapy, total knee arthroplasty is very expensive, with average costs ranging between $25,000 and $50,000, and as many as 30% of patients are dissatisfied with the outcome of this procedure. The earlier a patient receives TJA, the more likely it is that the patient will need repeat replacement surgery in following years. In 2010, inpatient costs exceeded $13 billion per year in the United States for total knee arthroplasty alone 
 7


and based on some estimates the number of total knee arthroplasties is expected to increase six-fold to 3.5 million procedures per year between 2011 and 2030. Our own market research has indicated that healthcare payers would be willing to reimburse additional OA therapies that have the potential to delay the need for TJA.
 Limitations of Common Treatments for OA
 Oral therapies, such as NSAIDs, may offer adequate analgesia for early-stage OA pain, but they may be associated with serious side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular events and other adverse events.  For example, SNRIs may have a role in worsening depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients. In addition to their serious side effects, oral drugs may provide limited pain relief and eventually can become insufficient to control OA pain for many patients as the disease progresses.
 IA therapies, including immediate-release steroids and HA preparations, are generally well-tolerated but provide pain relief that is often insufficient or inadequate in duration. Historically, all IA steroid therapies approved for OA are immediate-release suspensions or solutions that leave the joint within hours to days, and they are rapidly absorbed systemically, which may result in undesirable side effects. For example, IA immediate-release steroid injections are associated with a rapid elevation of blood glucose in diabetics, which can be of clinical concern. While IA steroids demonstrate large initial analgesic effects relative to other therapies, as a result of leaving the joint quickly, IA steroids typically fail to confer pain relief of sufficient magnitude or duration. In addition, current clinical practice dictate that IA steroid suspensions not be administered more frequently than once every three months. Based on internal analysis, we believe approximately 44% of patients receiving IA immediate-release steroids are unsatisfied with the duration of benefit.
 Despite U.S. sales of approximately $977 million in 2016 and 2017 sales estimated to exceed $1 billion, IA HA therapies, which are approved only for treatment in the knee, produce only marginally more effective pain relief than placebo and may have no discernible effect on a patient’s ability to carry out their daily activities. In treatment guidelines for non-operative management of knee OA published in May 2013, the AAOS concluded that data from then-current published studies did not show clinically meaningful effectiveness for HA injections. As a result, the guidelines do not recommend HA treatment for symptomatic knee OA due to lack of efficacy and, most recently, certain insurance carriers are no longer providing policy coverage of HA.
 While the consequences from the overuse and abuse of opioids are well-known, these powerful medicines are still commonly prescribed for OA related pain, despite the fact that they are not an effective treatment for this chronic condition. A recent study estimated that as many as 70% of patients who are prescribed a medicine for OA pain will receive an opioid, and we believe this is a reflection of the fact that physicians have so few effective treatment options. We believe that the growing societal awareness of the risks posed by opioids may make new treatment options attractive for patients and physicians seeking non-opioid alternatives. Beyond the significant concerns related to the potential for overuse, abuse and unintentional overdose, opioid use is also associated with a host of other serious side effects including, respiratory depression, hypotension, constipation, cardiac events and, increasingly, death.
 The Flexion Extended-Release Technology 
 Our extended-release technology allows us to incorporate active pharmaceutical ingredients in PLGA microspheres. We believe we are the first company to administer PLGA microspheres into a human joint. PLGA is a proven extended-release delivery vehicle that is metabolized to carbon dioxide and water as it releases drug in the IA space and is used in other approved drug products and surgical devices. The technology is designed to enable novel formulations of pharmaceuticals by providing extended-release of drugs over time and the physical properties of the polymer-drug matrix can be varied to achieve specified drug loads and release rates. Key to the success of our IA therapies is the ability to maintain persistent concentrations of drug in the joint, while minimizing systemic exposure.  Utilizing our PLGA microsphere technology, ZILRETTA is the first and only approved extended-release, IA therapy for patients confronting OA-related knee pain.  
 We believe ZILRETTA and our technology will be protected primarily through a combination of patents, trade secrets and proprietary know-how, and we intend to seek marketing exclusivity for any approved products. A composition of matter patent has been issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, for 
 8


ZILRETTA, with a patent term into 2031. The U.S. PTO has also issued two patents directed at the methods of manufacturing and using ZILRETTA with patent terms into 2031. Considerable expertise and effort was required to carry out the large body of original work underlying the formulation of ZILRETTA, including experimenting with, and observing the effects of over 50 steroid and PLGA formulations. We believe our extensive know-how and trade secrets relating to the manufacturing process for ZILRETTA, including those that relate to precise pharmaceutical release profiles, represent a competitive advantage.
 The Flexion Pipeline
 Our pipeline strategy is to continue to study ZILRETTA in other areas and, if feasible, expand ZILRETTA’s label to include additional indications and broaden its scope of administration, and build a robust pipeline of additional locally administered therapies to address musculoskeletal conditions, with an initial focus on OA.  

FX101 (fluticasone ER)
 FX101 utilizes our proprietary microsphere technology to create an extended-release formulation of fluticasone, a well-known corticosteroid, within a PLGA matrix. The approach builds on our deep experience and expertise in developing and commercializing microsphere-based, extended-release therapies. We are assessing whether FX101 holds the potential to deliver meaningful OA pain relief for at least six months. FX101 has been designed to provide sustained duration of analgesia after local administration of extended release formulation, while potentially minimizing systemic side effects.  The results of our ongoing and planned early studies will inform our decision on the next steps of for the program.  
 FX201
 FX201 is an IA gene therapy candidate which is designed to induce the local production of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), an anti-inflammatory protein.  Following injection of FX201, its genetic material is incorporated into local cells, and IL-1Ra is expressed in response to inflammation in the joint tissues. Inflammation is a known cause of pain, and chronic inflammation is thought to play a major role in the progression of OA. By persistently suppressing inflammation, FX201 has the potential to both reduce pain and possibly arrest disease progression. Based on preclinical data, we believe a single injection of FX201 could enable expression of IL-1Ra in an osteoarthritic joint for at least a year. Pending successful results from additional preclinical studies and our GLP toxicology studies, we intend to file an IND and initiate a proof-of-concept clinical trial in 2019. We acquired the rights to FX201 via a definitive agreement with GeneQuine Biotherapeutics GmbH, or GeneQuine, and have an exclusive license to the underlying intellectual property rights for human use of FX201 from Baylor College of Medicine.

ZILRETTA – FDA Approved Product for the Management of OA Knee Pain
 Regulatory Developments
 On October 6, 2017, ZILRETTA (triamcinolone acetonide extended-release injectable suspension) received approval from the FDA for the management of OA pain of the knee. ZILRETTA is the first and only approved extended-release, IA therapy for OA knee pain. It is a non-opioid medicine that employs our proprietary microsphere technology to provide proven pain relief over 12 weeks. The approval was based upon data from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, a randomized, double-blind study which evaluated 486 patients at 37 centers worldwide.  
 ZILRETTA’s label reflects its strong safety profile and states the most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥1%) in clinical studies included sinusitis, cough and contusions. We believe ZILRETTA’s extended-release profile may also provide effective treatment for OA pain of the shoulder and OA pain of the hip and have initiated a clinical trial to investigate it in these joints.Summary of Active and Key Completed Clinical Trials 
 Prior to approval, we completed seven clinical trials evaluating ZILRETTA (also known as FX006) against either immediate release triamcinolone acetonide crystalline suspension (TAcs), placebo (saline), or both in patients with OA of the knee. In total, 424 patients were treated with a single IA injection (32mg) of ZILRETTA in those trials.   
 We currently have three active ZILRETTA clinical trials:  
  
• | In February 2017, we initiated an open-label, Phase 3b trial to evaluate the safety of repeat administration of ZILRETTA in patients with OA of the knee. The 208 study participants received an initial IA injection of ZILRETTA on day 1 followed by evaluation at weeks 12, 16, 20 and 24 to determine their eligibility for a second IA injection of ZILRETTA. Participants who received a repeat administration of ZILRETTA will be followed for a total of 52 weeks after the initial injection, regardless of when the second injection was administered. At specified times throughout the study, participants undergo physical examinations, knee assessments and X-rays.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In January 2018, we reported initial data showing that of the 205 evaluable patients, 95% (195/205) experienced clinical benefit by week 12 following the initial injection of ZILRETTA, as determined by self-assessment and with the agreement of their physician. In the trial, 92% (179/195) of eligible patients received a second dose of ZILRETTA between weeks 12 and 24.  The full study results are expected in the third quarter of 2018.
  
• | In December 2017, we enrolled the first patient in a trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of concurrent injections of ZILRETTA in patients with bilateral OA of the knee. The open-label, Phase 2 study is randomized (1:1) with patients receiving either two IA injections of 32 mg ZILRETTA or two 40 mg injections of immediate-release TA. The study was fully enrolled with 24 patients in January 2018 and results are anticipated in the second quarter of 2018. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Also in December 2017, we announced a study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of ZILRETTA in patients with OA of the shoulder or hip. Known as the "SHIP" study, patients are randomized (1:1) to receive either a single IA injection of 32 mg ZILRETTA or 40 mg immediate-release TA. The open-label, Phase 2 trial is expected to recruit approximately 48 patients in total, comprised of 24 patients with OA of the shoulder and 24 patients with OA of the hip. We expect to report top-line results of the study in the second half of 2018. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Completed Studies 
 In November 2016, we announced top-line results from a clinical trial to assess the effects of ZILRETTA on the blood glucose levels of adults with OA of the knee who also have Type 2 (adult) diabetes. The objective of the double-blind, randomized, parallel group, single-dose study was to examine if ZILRETTA had effects on blood glucose levels that differ from immediate-release TA. Investigators from seven study sites enrolled 33 patients, 
 10


randomized 1:1 to receive a single IA injection of 32 mg ZILRETTA or 40 mg immediate-release TA. Blood glucose levels were evaluated for a total of three weeks (one week prior to injection and two weeks post injection) using a continuous glucose monitoring device. Patients returned for follow-up visits at day 8, day 15 and day 43 (week 6). The primary endpoint compared the change in average glucose values from the period of 72 hours before to the period of 72 hours after injection with ZILRETTA versus immediate-release TA.  The data demonstrate that ZILRETTA is associated with a statistically significant (p-value of <0.05, 2-sided) and clinically relevant reduction in the rise of blood glucose compared to that observed following TA injection in patients who also have knee OA. In clinical trials, the “p-value” is the probability that the result was obtained by chance. For example, a “p-value” of less than 0.10 (or p<0.10) would indicate that there is a less than 10% likelihood that the observed results could have happened at random. By convention, a “p-value” that is less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant.
 In February 2016, we announced top-line results from our pivotal ZILRETTA study, a Phase 3 clinical trial that evaluated 486 patients with moderate to severe OA knee pain. This Phase 3 trial randomized patients 1:1:1 to ZILRETTA 32 mg, immediate release TA 40 mg or placebo (saline) injection. It met its primary endpoint at week 12, demonstrating highly statistically significant (p<0.0001) pain relief against placebo (saline). In addition, ZILRETTA achieved a statistically significant change from baseline as compared to placebo in weekly ADP intensity score through week 12 as measured by the area under effect curve (p<0.0001) (demonstrating a 50% reduction from baseline). It also delivered persistent analgesia against placebo in this trial at each of weeks 1 through 16. Results showed ZILRETTA was superior to placebo on ADP, however a secondary exploratory analysis showed a numeric but not statistically significant difference between ZILRETTA and immediate-release TA for the change from baseline at Week 12 in weekly mean ADP.
 
In pre-specified exploratory analyses, compared to placebo and immediate-release TA, ZILRETTA also demonstrated numeric improvement at each measured time point through 12 weeks on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, commonly referred to as WOMAC®, subscales for WOMAC A (pain), WOMAC B (stiffness) and WOMAC C (function) and the validated Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, commonly referred to as KOOS, quality of life, or QOL, subscale.  WOMAC is a validated, widely accepted questionnaire (in our surveys over 90% of treating orthopedists are familiar with WOMAC whereas only approximately 10% are familiar with the Numeric Rating Scale which forms the basis for the ADP determination) used by healthcare professionals to specifically evaluate the condition of patients with OA of the knee and hip, including pain, stiffness, and physical function of the joints and the KOOS QOL subscale is a validated questionnaire used by healthcare professionals to evaluate the extent to which knee symptoms compromise a patient’s quality of life. 
 The frequency of treatment-related side effects in this study was comparable across all treatment arms. No drug-related serious adverse events were observed and no patients treated with ZILRETTA were discontinued from the study due to a treatment-related side effect. We have submitted the results, which have been accepted, for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal.
 Manufacturing
 We believe that the multifaceted nature of PLGA drug product manufacturing and the limited number of capable contract manufacturing companies that offer PLGA drug product manufacturing creates a competitive advantage. The technology is designed to enable novel formulations of pharmaceuticals by providing extended-release of drugs over time and the physical properties of the polymer-drug matrix can be varied to achieve specified drug loads and release rates.
 We utilize contract manufacturers to produce the drug substances and drug products used in ZILRETTA. Manufacture of PLGA microspheres is a complex process and there are a limited number of contract manufacturing sites with PLGA experience. Our proprietary injectable IA extended-release technology allows us to incorporate pharmaceuticals in PLGA microspheres, such as TA, in the case of ZILRETTA, and fluticasone, in the case of FX101, as well as potentially other product candidates. Following extensive development programs, we have established that a single injection of ZILRETTA sustains local concentrations of TA in the joint for several months. The ZILRETTA microsphere PLGA formulation has gone through numerous iterations and has been optimized to release the drug over an extended period of time. In developing this unique combination of manufacturing process and formulation, we have established numerous trade secrets that relate to precise pharmaceutical release profiles.

The active pharmaceutical ingredient in ZILRETTA, TA, is manufactured and supplied by Farmabios SpA in accordance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, standards. This supplier is subject to regular inspections by the FDA. The PLGA material used in the manufacture of ZILRETTA is supplied by Evonik Corporation, or Evonik. In November 2016, we entered into a Supply Agreement with Evonik for the purchase of PLGA for clinical and commercial supply of ZILRETTA. The initial term of the Supply Agreement is until July 2021 and will renew for two successive two year terms upon mutual written consent by both parties.  Under the Supply Agreement, we are bound to purchase PLGA from Evonik at certain minimum purchase amounts, which decrease over time, and at a specified price per gram, subject to adjustment from time to time, including due to changes in price indices and in the event the initial term of the Supply Agreement is extended.  Upon termination of the Supply Agreement (other than termination due to the bankruptcy of either Evonik or us) we are obligated to pay the costs associated with the binding supply forecast provided to Evonik. 
 In August 2015, we entered into a Manufacturing Agreement with Patheon U.K. Limited, or Patheon, for the manufacture of clinical and commercial supplies of ZILRETTA finished drug product. In connection with the agreement, Patheon undertook certain technical transfer activities and construction services to prepare its United Kingdom facility for the manufacture of ZILRETTA in dedicated manufacturing suites. The initial term of our Manufacturing Agreement with Patheon is until October 2027. We may terminate this agreement upon one month’s notice if a regulatory authority causes the withdrawal from, or halts development of, ZILRETTA (in either case for reasons outside our reasonable control) in the United States or any other market that represents 80% of our overall sales. We may also terminate this agreement at any time for convenience by providing 24 months’ notice. Either we or Patheon may terminate this Agreement in the event of (a) an unremedied material breach or bankruptcy of the other party, (b) if a material force majeure event remains uncured for a period of more than 90 days and (c) the granting of a permanent injunction to a third party claiming intellectual property infringement of ZILRETTA in the United States or UK. Upon termination of this agreement, we are obligated to pay for the costs associated with the removal of our manufacturing equipment and for Patheon’s termination costs up to a specified maximum amount.
 Commercial Strategy
 We have established a commercial infrastructure designed to drive the adoption and sales of ZILRETTA with the approximately 9,500 prescribers who treat approximately 70% of patients diagnosed with OA pain of the knee who receive an IA treatment. Of these prescribers, approximately 80% are orthopedists and rheumatologists. We hired our full complement of MBMs immediately following ZILRETTA’s approval on October 6, 2017. The MBMs were trained, certified and deployed in the field as of November 20, 2017, when they began the process of informing and educating prescribing clinicians about ZILRETTA. We distribute ZILRETTA solely through a limited network of contracted party specialty distributors and one specialty pharmacy.  While we believe that the United States represents the most attractive market for ZILRETTA, we continue to evaluate opportunities and potential partnerships to develop and commercialize ZILRETTA in territories outside the United States where we believe there is the potential for value-based pricing and reimbursement.
 Of patients who are treated for OA pain of the knee with an IA injection, we estimate that 55% receive IA injections from orthopedic surgeons. Approximately 8% of patients receive IA injections from physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) specialists and rheumatologists, and approximately 7% of patients are treated by sports medicine specialists. Approximately 12% are treated by primary care physicians. The remaining 18% of IA injections are administered by a wider array of providers, including physician’s assistants and nurse practitioners.  
 Competition
 Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. The large size and expanding scope of the pain market makes it an attractive therapeutic area for biopharmaceutical businesses. Our potential competitors include pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and specialty pharmaceutical companies. Several of these companies have robust drug pipelines, readily available capital and established research and development organizations. We believe our success will be driven by our ability to develop and commercialize treatment options that make a meaningful difference for patients with musculoskeletal conditions, beginning with OA.

The key competitive factors that could affect the success of ZILRETTA’s launch are likely to be efficacy, safety, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. Immediate-release steroids and HA are currently the two marketed classes of IA products that compete directly with ZILRETTA. 
 Also on the market are platelet rich plasma injections, but these require on site preparation from blood drawn from the patient, have generated questionable efficacy in controlled clinical trials, and we believe they are unlikely to be a broadly embraced therapeutic option for OA patients. Because platelet rich plasma is a therapy derived from the individual patient’s blood, it does not require and has not received FDA review or approval. For that reason, it is generally not reimbursed by payers and patients must pay out of pocket to receive this therapy.
 In addition to marketed IA medications for OA, other companies have OA medical devices and product candidates in advanced stages of clinical development. These IA products include:
  
• | Anika Therapeutics, Inc.’s Cingal®, which is a mixture of Anika’s Monovisc and a low dose of a commonly used immediate-release steroid. Anika filed a Pre-Market Application with the FDA for Cingal based on a single pivotal clinical trial. In December 2015, Anika announced that due to the steroid component of the product, it will need to file this product candidate under an NDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Halyard Health, Inc.’s COOLIEF, which is a Cooled Radiofrequency (RF) device used to ablate sensory nerves. In April 2017, Halyard received FDA clearance for COOLIEF to treat patients with chronic moderate to severe OA knee pain and has a trial underway comparing COOLIEF to HA injection (Synvisc-One® (hylan G-F 20)). The estimated primary completion date is Q2 2019. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Actavis plc/Hanmi Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.’s HA product Hyalrheuma, which is an HA preparation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | TissueGene, Inc.’s Invossa™, which is a combination of human allogeneic chondrocytes and TGF-β1 transfected allogeneic chondrocytes. We believe Invossa is planning to initiate Phase 3 clinical trials in the U.S. in 2018.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s Ampion™, which is a derivative of human serum albumin, is described as having anti-inflammatory properties, and is formulated for immediate-release. Ampio stated that Ampion is in Phase 3 development and has not announced a timeline for potentially submitting a BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Centrexion Therapeutics Corporation’s CNTX-4975, which is a synthetic, ultra-pure injection of trans-capsaicin. In February 2018, Centrexion announced that the first patient was treated in a Phase 3 clinical trial for CNTX-4975, and according to clinicaltrials.gov, the study is expected to complete in February 2020.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We believe that programs such as Orthotrophix’s TPX-100, Merck Serono’s sprifermin FGF-18, Abbvie’s ABT-981, Menarini’s MEN16132, Dong-A’s DA-5202, Ember Therapeutics BMP-7, Samumed’s SM04690, and Allergan, Inc.’s botulinum toxin, have not yet entered Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Eupraxia’s EP-104 is a Phase 1 therapy for knee OA that combines an unapproved carrier technology (Plexis) with a steroid (fluticasone).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Taiwan Liposome Company’s TLC599, which is a liposomal formulation of dexamethasone sodium phosphate. TLC599 is currently in Phase 2 clinical development.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stem cell approaches to OA are being explored, but these are earlier in development, bear significant technical risks and it remains to be seen how applicable they will be to the treatment of OA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A number of investigational nerve growth factor antibodies are in development. Regeneron’s fasinumab and Pfizer and Eli Lilly’s tanezumab are both in Phase 3 development.

 Intellectual Property/Patents and Proprietary Rights
 Intellectual Property and Exclusivity
 We seek to protect ZILRETTA and our product candidates and technology through a combination of patents, trade secrets, proprietary know-how, FDA exclusivity and contractual restrictions on disclosure.
 13


Patents and Patent Applications
 Our policy is to seek to protect the proprietary position of ZILRETTA and our product candidates by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. U.S. patents generally have a term of 20 years from the earliest effective date of the application.
 As of January 31, 2018, we owned three U.S. issued patents, two pending U.S. applications, and counterpart foreign patents and patent applications, all directed to ZILRETTA. One issued U.S. patent directed to ZILRETTA relates to its composition of matter and has an expiration date in 2031. A second issued U.S. patent directed to ZILRETTA relates to methods of manufacturing ZILRETTA and has an expiration date in 2031. A third issued U.S. patent directed to ZILRETTA relates to methods of using ZILRETTA and has an expiration date in 2031. The ZILRETTA composition of matter patent is the result of several unique discoveries relating to a narrow drug load specification, a certain release profile of polymers, specific polymer weights and ratios and clinical efficacy observed within a dose-range. The patents directed to ZILRETTA’s composition of matter and methods of using ZILRETTA are listed in the FDA Orange Book. The two pending U.S. applications directed at ZILRETTA, if resulting in issued patents, could provide additional claims expiring in 2031 and 2037.
 During 2017, we expanded our patent portfolio with additional granted patents related to ZILRETTA outside the United States. In 2017, we had patents granted in Australia, Canada, China, Indonesia and Singapore further expanding to the scope of the previously granted patents in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan and Ukraine. Generally, these foreign patents are directed to compositions of matter for ZILRETTA, methods of manufacturing ZILRETTA and/or methods of using ZILRETTA, and are similar in scope to the protection in the United States described above. In addition, we have applications pending in Europe and additional countries throughout the world directed to ZILRETTA and related inventions.  
 We have also exclusively licensed issued patents, owned by SwRI, directed to our proprietary microsphere manufacturing technology used in the production of ZILRETTA. These patents are scheduled to expire in 2025.
 As of January 31, 2018, we also have one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty patent application directed to the formulation comprising our FX101 product candidate, as well as one pending U.S. provisional patent application related to FX101. In addition, we have exclusively licensed patents and patent applications owned by Baylor College of Medicine for human applications directed to our FX201 product candidate. The Baylor patents are issued in China and Europe, with expiry dates in 2032, and pending in Australia, Eurasia, India, Japan and the U.S.
 Finally, we have other patent applications directed to formulations and/or uses of compounds that are not directly relevant to ZILRETTA or our current programs in development.
 Trade Secrets and Proprietary Information
 The ZILRETTA microsphere PLGA formulation has gone through numerous iterations and has been optimized to deliver the drug substance released over an extended period of time. In developing this unique combination of manufacturing process and formulation, we have established numerous trade secrets, including those that relate to a precise pharmaceutical release profile. In addition, due to the complexity of the extended-release technology and the time, costs and technical risks involved in demonstrating bioequivalence through clinical trials, we believe that the ability of manufacturers to gain market approval for generic alternatives to ZILRETTA upon expiration of our patents and FDA exclusivity will be challenging.
 We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees to execute a Proprietary Information, Inventions, Non-Solicitation, and Non-Competition Agreement upon the commencement of their employment. Consultants and other advisors are required to sign consulting agreements. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Further, we require confidentiality agreements from entities that receive our confidential data or materials.

Intellectual Property Agreements
 Southwest Research Institute Manufacturing® (SwRI) License
In July 2014, we executed an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement with SwRI to utilize proprietary microsphere manufacturing technologies for production of our extended-release drug candidates, including ZILRETTA. The SwRI technologies employ a uniquely controlled and continuous atomizing technology that facilitated scale-up of commercial supply. This exclusive agreement provides for an expanded field of use in a variety of musculoskeletal disorders, as well as broader polymer and steroid ranges, which offers the flexibility to potentially explore different doses, disease indications, and drug-PLGA combinations. We have no further payment obligations following the amendment executed by the parties in February 2017 and the license remains in effect through patent term expiry. 
FX201 Related Agreements  
 In December 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement with GeneQuine to acquire the global rights to FX201. As part of the asset purchase transaction with GeneQuine, we made an upfront payment of $2 million.  We may also be required to make additional milestone payments during the development of FX201, including up to $8.7 million through Phase 2 proof of concept (PoC) and, following successful PoC, up to an additional $54 million in development and global regulatory approval milestone payments.  As part of the transaction, we became the direct licensee of certain underlying Baylor College of Medicine (Baylor) patents and other proprietary rights related to FX201 for human applications.  The Baylor license agreement grants us an exclusive, royalty-bearing, world-wide right and license (with a right to sublicense) for human applications under its patent and other proprietary rights directly related to FX201, with a similar non-exclusive license to certain Baylor intellectual property rights that are not specific to FX201.  The license agreement with Baylor includes a low single-digit royalty on net sales of FX201 and requires us to use reasonable efforts to develop FX201 according to timelines set out in the license agreement.  In December 2017, we also entered into a Master Production Services Agreement with SAFC Carlsbad, Inc., a part of MilliporeSigma, for the manufacturing of pre-clinical and initial clinical supplies of FX201.  
Termination of FX007 Agreement
 On March 5, 2018, we sent AstraZeneca AB notice that we are terminating the Out-License Agreement between the parties, dated as of September 13, 2010, related to our FX007 pyrazole formulation development program. Pursuant to the terms of the Out-License Agreement, the termination will be effective three months after our delivery of the notice. As previously disclosed, we have discontinued internal development of FX007. Upon termination of the Out-License Agreement, our rights pertaining to FX007 will revert to AstraZeneca and our milestone, royalty and patent maintenance obligations under the agreement will cease.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing and commercializing. 
 15


U.S. Biopharmaceutical Product Development Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biopharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. Biopharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a biopharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, or other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s laws and regulations pertaining to the conduct of human clinical studies, collectively referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, and according to the International Council for Harmonization, or ICH, GCP guidelines, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biopharmaceutical product for its intended use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA for a proposed new drug product or a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for a biological product;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biopharmaceutical product is produced and tested to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP requirements, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biopharmaceutical product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval or licensure of the NDA or BLA.
--+--------------------------------------------------------

 The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals are inherently uncertain.
 Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the biopharmaceutical product candidate enters the nonclinical testing stage, also referred to as preclinical testing. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the biopharmaceutical product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP.  The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, among other things, to the FDA as part of the IND application. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biopharmaceutical product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biopharmaceutical product candidate to healthy subjects or patients with the target disease under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the 
 16


parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s regulations which reflect the ICH GCP requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at, or servicing, each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed.
 Clinical trials for biopharmaceutical product candidates are typically conducted in humans in three sequential phases that may overlap.  In Phase 1 clinical trials, the biopharmaceutical product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety or adverse effects, dosage, tolerance, metabolism, distribution, excretion and clinical pharmacology.  In Phase 2 clinical trials, the biopharmaceutical product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks, evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the biopharmaceutical product for specific targeted indications and determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule for patients having the specific disease.  Once a biopharmaceutical product shows evidence of effectiveness and is found to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to more fully evaluate clinical outcomes.  In Phase 3 clinical trials, the biopharmaceutical product is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well-controlled trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the biopharmaceutical product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the biopharmaceutical product and to provide adequate information for its labeling.
 Post-approval studies, also referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as part of the approval process.
 Progress reports detailing the status of biopharmaceutical product development and results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects or patients. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board (if applicable) may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biopharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to study subjects.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biopharmaceutical product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the biopharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the safety, identity, strength, quality and purity of the final biopharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biopharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 FDA Review and Approval Processes
 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies for claimed indications as well as descriptions of the manufacturing process and controls, analytical tests conducted on the biopharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. Additionally, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and the support for dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective, are contained in an NDA or BLA. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers after the initial submission of a pediatric study plan following an end of Phase 2 meeting unless otherwise agreed upon by the FDA and the sponsor. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 17


The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the application for filing. Once the application is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has 12 months after submission for a new molecular entity in which to complete its initial review and respond to the applicant, and eight months for a priority review application. In addition, the FDA has 10 months after submission of an NDA for a non-new molecular entity in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority review NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for review of standard and priority review applications. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by additional three month review periods whenever the FDA requests or the sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission at any time during the review cycle.
 The FDA reviews the NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biopharmaceutical products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biopharmaceutical product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the application without a REMS, if required.
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facilities at which the product is to be manufactured. When an inspection is undertaken, the FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an application, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA regulations regarding conduct of clinical trials for the product’s trials. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in a complete response letter to the applicant and often will request additional testing or information.
 If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the application, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or REMS to assure safe use of the product through distribution or other controls. In addition, the FDA may require post approval studies, referred to as Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Any products for which we receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. These promotion and advertising requirements include, among other things, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions against promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), rules for conducting industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
 18


We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are also required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA. These restrictions may include suspension of a product until the FDA is assured that quality standards can be met, continuing oversight of manufacturing by the FDA under a consent decree of permanent injunction, which frequently includes the imposition of costs and continuing inspections over a period of many years, as well as possible withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any biopharmaceutical products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers.
 In the United States, third-party payers include federal and state government payer programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the third-party payer will pay for the drug product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. In addition, our biopharmaceutical products may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective.
 A third-party payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payer’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not ensure that other payers also will provide coverage or an adequate reimbursement rate for the drug product. Adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payer interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will continue experiencing pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing and could adversely affect our net revenue and results.
 19


Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, and on prescription drugs in particular, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any Company.
 Additionally, in order to be eligible for certain federal agencies and grantees to purchase ZILRETTA, or to have it paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs, we participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) pricing program. We are obligated through the FSS program to sell ZILRETTA through a FSS contract and charge a price that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price (FCP) to four federal agencies (VA, U.S. Department of Defense, Public Health Service, and Coast Guard). The FCP is based on the non-federal Average Manufacturer Price (Non-FAMP), which we will need to calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. These obligations contain extensive disclosure and certification requirements.  
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs, improve healthcare quality or expand access to healthcare.
 In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The MMA expanded Medicare coverage to include outpatient prescription drug purchases made by the elderly by establishing Medicare Part D and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician administered drugs under Medicare Part B. In addition, the MMA provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that would be covered in any therapeutic class under the Medicare Part D program. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and reimbursement rate that we receive for ZILRETTA and any of our other approved products. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the Medicare Modernization Act may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers.
 In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively PPACA, was enacted as a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of PPACA of importance to our potential drug candidates are the following:
  
• | an annual, non-deductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 20


 
• | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | new requirements under the federal Open Payments program, created under Section 6002 of PPACA, and its implementing regulations, that manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to “payments or other transfers of value” made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and that applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for non-compliance;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an FDA-approval framework for follow-on biologic products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishment of a Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to numerous provisions of PPACA.  Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Health Care Reform Law or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by PPACA. Further, The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, signed into law on December 22, 2017, removed the individual mandate starting in 2019 that required individuals to have insurance or face a penalty.  Additionally, on January 23, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain PPACA-mandated fees. Congress may consider additional legislation to repeal or replace other elements of PPACA.
 We expect that PPACA reform, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, as well as additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, including ZILRETTA. There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices, including at the federal level several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, increase drug pricing transparency, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, review relationships between pricing and manufacturer patient assistance programs, and reform government program drug reimbursement methodologies. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. At the state level, legislatures have 
 21


increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize ZILRETTA and any future products for which we receive regulatory approval.  
 Accelerated Approval for Regenerative Advanced Therapies 
 As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, Congress recently amended the FDCA to create an accelerated approval program for regenerative advanced therapies, which include cell therapies, gene therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products. Regenerative advanced therapies do not include those gene therapies, human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products regulated solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR Part 1271. The new program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of regenerative advanced therapies, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. A drug sponsor may request that the FDA designate a drug as a regenerative advanced therapy concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. The FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the drug meets the criteria, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. A NDA or BLA for a regenerative advanced therapy may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Benefits of such designation also include early interactions with the FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval. A regenerative advanced therapy that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States, our activities are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including CMS, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, various activities, including but not limited to sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs, must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act and similar state laws, each as amended. Failure to comply with such requirements could potentially result in substantial penalties to us. Even if we structure our programs with the intent of compliance with such laws, there can be no certainty that we would not need to defend against enforcement or litigation, in light of the fact that there is significant enforcement interest in pharmaceutical companies in the United States, and some of the applicable laws are quite broad in scope.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of business, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of a good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare or Medicaid program. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers, among others, on the other. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. 
 22


Federal false claims and false statements laws, including the federal False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for items or services, including drugs, for payment to, or approval by, a federal healthcare program, including Medicare or Medicaid. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring a civil action on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. 
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including third-party payers. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 Also, many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payer, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the federal government’s and/or pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, as well as state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA. 
 Where our activities involve foreign government officials, they may also potentially be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits companies and individuals from engaging in specified activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. Under the FCPA, it is illegal to pay, offer to pay, or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, governmental staff members, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.  
 If we seek to have a product covered in the United States by the Medicaid programs, various obligations, including government price reporting, are required under the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, each as amended, which generally require products to be offered at substantial rebates/discounts to such programs and certain purchasers. In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Many of our current as well as possible future activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. We must also comply with laws that require clinical trial registration and reporting of clinical trial results on the publicly available clinical trial databank maintained by the National Institutes of Health at www.ClinicalTrials.gov. We are subject to various environmental, health and safety regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances. From time to time, and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous materials.
 23


To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 U.S. Marketing Exclusivity
 Hatch-Waxman Exclusivity. Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s NDA. If the new drug is a new chemical entity subject to an NDA, the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, such an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Rest of World Government Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our future products.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 251 full-time employees. None of our employees is represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Research and Development
 We invested $51.2 million, $41.3 million, and $32.7 million in research and development in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
