ITEM 1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

 | THE COMPANY 
Exact corporate name: | International Automated Systems, Inc.
State and date of incorporation: | Utah- September 26, 1986. 
Street address of principal office: | 2730 West 4000 South

International Automated Systems, Inc. (“the Company”), was organized under the laws of the State of Utah on September 26, 1986. In April 1988 the Company filed a registration statement for a public offering under the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 ("1933 Act") to sell a maximum of 1,074,000 units at a price of $.50 per unit. Each unit was comprised of one share of common stock and one common stock purchase warrant. The Company sold approximately 200,000 units at the offering price of $.50 per unit realizing total proceeds of approximately $100,000. All warrants expired without exercise.

Over time, the Company, for the most part, has been engaged in the investigation, design and development of technology based upon the exclusive rights to patents or exclusive rights to patented technologies obtained from the president of the Company or from entities controlled by the president of the Company.

OVERVIEW

International Automated Systems, Inc., a Utah corporation (hereinafter "Registrant" or "Company") based in American Fork, Utah, seeks to design, produce and develop plans for the marketing of leading edge technology products.

The Company has production models of a patented turbine which uses the expansion of steam to generate a rotational force and a patented solar lens which may be included in systems which generate alternative solar energy.

The Company feels the turbine could be used in, but not limited to, the production of electricity, hydrogen or in the transportation industry. Though some testing has been done using pure steam and geothermal steam, more testing will be done. There are risks that the turbine may never be accepted.

The Company previously had an Alternate Solar Energy Thermal System (“System”) which was developed in conjunction with the Company’s bladeless turbine and solar lens to generate to provide solar electricity in commercial quantities. The system was designed to track the sun, efficiently concentrating the solar energy onto a receiver. The energy produced would propell the bladeless turbine, generating electricity. 
 
The Company developed an automated self-service check-out system and management software. This system allows retail customers to ring up their purchases without a cashier or clerk. The system is primarily designed for grocery stores, but may be applicable in other retail establishments.
 The Company has developed an Automated Fingerprint Identification Machine ("AFIM") designed to verify the identity of individuals. Potential AFIM applications include products for both commercial and governmental users, including employee time-keeping and security-access control and check, debit or credit card verification. .

The Company has developed technology that transmits information and data using different wave patterns, configurations and timing in the electromagnetic spectrum. The Company refers to this technology as digital wave modulation ("DWM"). The Company believes that when the technology is implemented and applied commercially, the technology will have the capability to increase the amount of information which can be transmitted. 

The Company is continuing the development of the DWM technology.The commercial feasibility of the technology has not been demonstrated. The Company believes it has many competitors in the communications, information data transfer and data storage industries which have greater capital resources, more experienced personnel and technologies which are currently more established and accepted in the market place.

The first anticipated product using DWM technology is a high-speed modem. The modem is projected to be faster than modems currently in use. Generally modems are used for purposes of transmitting data over telephone lines, on telecommunications systems and over wireless mediums such as satellite transmissions and line- of-sight transmission mediums. The Company has a modem prototype. Additional development is required to achieve a commercial product. 

The Company’s objective is to apply the DWM technology in other areas. The Company has not established a plan or order of priorities for any future commercial product development. The Company may not be successful in its efforts to have commercially exploitable products due to difficulties and problems which may interfere with the future development efforts. Problems may arise, such as inability to design, construct and/or manufacture commercial products, the Company's lack of funding and financial resources and availability of experienced personnel. Competitors may develop technologies which are superior and will make the DWM technology obsolete even before the Company can complete its development of any commercial products. Cost will also be a factor in both the development and the commercialization of any new product. It is anticipated that if a commercially viable modem is developed, the Company will have to expend funds to develop a marketing plan and introduce the product into the market. Costs to offer new products and to establish the proper marketing strategy will be significant. The Company has not made any projections regarding any anticipated costs.

There are risks that no commercially viable products will be developed from the technologies and any products developed may not be accepted or successful in the marketplace. In addition, the Company may not have sufficient funds to develop, manufacture, and market any products when developed.

Propulsion Steam Turbine

The Company has a patented bladeless turbine production model. It uses the expansion of steam, through propulsion, to create a rotational force.

The production model has been tested using pure steam created by a gas heat exchanger. The Company believes its propulsion design has several advantages over current bladed turbines. The Company believes its turbine is at least as efficient as traditional turbines, is smaller in size, requires less maintenance, is mass producible and may be less expensive to manufacture. It also doesn't require cooling towers, making it more mobile, more economical and water conserving.
