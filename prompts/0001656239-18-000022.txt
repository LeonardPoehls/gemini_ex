Overview
The Company
Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. owns and operates 16 gaming, hospitality and entertainment businesses, of which 15 operate in leased facilities. Our owned facility is located in Ohio and our leased facilities are located in Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada and Pennsylvania. The leased facilities located outside of Pennsylvania are subject to the Master Lease (as defined below) and our leased facility located in Pennsylvania is subject to the Meadows Lease (as defined below). We view each of our operating businesses as an operating segment with the exception of our two businesses in Jackpot, Nevada, which we view as one operating segment. For financial reporting purposes, we aggregate our operating segments into three reportable segments: Midwest, South and West (see “Operating Properties” below). 
Our mission is to increase stockholder value. We seek to increase revenues through enhancing the guest experience by providing them with their favorite games, restaurants, hotel accommodations, entertainment and other amenities in attractive surroundings with high-quality guest service and our mychoice guest loyalty program. We seek to improve cash flows by focusing on operational excellence and efficiency while trying to exceed our guests’ expectations of value. In making decisions, we consider our stockholders, guests, team members and other constituents in the communities in which we operate.
Over the last several years, we have grown through strategic acquisitions, notably the acquisition of Ameristar Casinos, Inc. (“Ameristar”) in August 2013 and the acquisition of The Meadows Racetrack and Casino (“Meadows”) in September 2016, as well as through the development and opening of three properties: Belterra Park, L’Auberge Baton Rouge and River City. We have also made strategic dispositions over the last several years, notably the April 2016 sale-leaseback of the majority of our real estate assets to Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (“GLPI”), a real estate investment trust, and the sale of the equity interests in subsidiaries that operated the Lumiére Place Casino, HoteLumiére, and the Four Seasons Hotel St. Louis (collectively, the “Lumiére Place Casino and Hotels”).
References herein to “Pinnacle,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” refer to Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where stated or the context otherwise indicates. References to “Former Pinnacle” refer to Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. prior to the Spin-Off and Merger (as such terms are defined below).
Proposed Company Sale
On December 17, 2017, Pinnacle entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Penn National Merger Agreement”) with Penn National Gaming, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (“Penn National”), and Franchise Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Penn National (“Franchise Merger Sub”), providing for the merger of Franchise Merger Sub with and into Pinnacle (the “Proposed Company Sale”), with Pinnacle surviving the Proposed Company Sale as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Penn National.
At the effective time of the Proposed Company Sale, each share of Pinnacle common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Pinnacle Common Stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares held by Penn National and other than dissenting shares) will be canceled and converted automatically into the right to receive (i) $20.00 in cash (plus, if the Proposed Company Sale is not consummated on or prior to October 31, 2018, $0.01 for each day during the period commencing on November 1, 2018 through the effective time of the Proposed Company Sale) (the “Cash Consideration”) and (ii) 0.42 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Penn National (the “Penn National Common Stock”) (the “Exchange Ratio”; together with the Cash Consideration and cash required to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Penn National Common Stock, the “Proposed Company Sale Consideration”).
In connection with the Proposed Company Sale, Penn National entered into (i) a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Membership Interest Purchase Agreement”) with Boyd Gaming Corporation (“Boyd”), to which Pinnacle will become a party immediately prior to the Proposed Company Sale, pursuant to which a subsidiary of Boyd will acquire the gaming and related operations of Ameristar St. Charles, Ameristar Kansas City, Belterra Resort and Belterra Park, in connection with the Proposed Company Sale; and (ii) definitive agreements with a subsidiary of GLPI, a Pennsylvania corporation, to which Pinnacle will become a party immediately prior to the Proposed Company Sale, pursuant to which GLPI’s subsidiary will acquire the real estate associated with Belterra Park, from Pinnacle, and Plainridge Park Casino in Plainville, Massachusetts, from Penn National. At the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, GLPI

and Boyd will enter into a master lease agreement for the gaming operations acquired by Boyd and Penn National will assume Pinnacle’s existing Master Lease and Meadows Lease and enter into certain amendments thereto.
Completion of the Proposed Company Sale is subject to certain conditions, many of which are beyond our control, including, among others: (1) receipt of the approval of stockholders of both Penn National and Pinnacle as required for the transaction, including the approval of the issuance of Penn National’s common stock in connection with the Proposed Company Sale Consideration; (2) the absence of any injunction, restraining order or other orders or laws prohibiting the consummation of the Proposed Company Sale; (3) the expiration or termination of any waiting period applicable to the Proposed Company Sale under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Acts of 1976, as amended; (4) the receipt of all required regulatory approvals in a timely manner (including receipt of necessary approvals from gaming regulatory authorities); (5) the registration of the shares of Penn National to be issued to stockholders of Pinnacle; and (6) the listing of the shares of Penn National on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”). The obligation of each party to consummate the Proposed Company Sale is also conditioned upon the accuracy of the other party’s representations and warranties, the absence of a material adverse effect involving the other party, and the other party having performed in all material respects its obligations under the Penn National Merger Agreement. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions, the Proposed Company Sale is expected to close in the second half of 2018. If the Proposed Company Sale is completed, Pinnacle stockholders will hold approximately 22% of the combined company’s outstanding shares.
If the Proposed Company Sale is not consummated on or before October 31, 2018, subject to certain limited extensions (including pursuant to Penn National’s election to extend under certain circumstances) provided in the Penn National Merger Agreement, either party may terminate the Penn National Merger Agreement. Consummation of the Proposed Company Sale is not subject to a financing condition.
There can be no assurance that the Proposed Company Sale will be completed as contemplated. Furthermore, there are a number of risks and uncertainties to our business related to the Proposed Company Sale. For additional information, please see Item 1A. “Risk Factors, Risks Relating to the Proposed Company Sale to Penn National.”
Spin-Off and Merger
On April 28, 2016, Former Pinnacle completed the transactions under the terms of a definitive agreement with GLPI (the “GLPI Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the GLPI Merger Agreement, Former Pinnacle separated its operating assets and liabilities (and its Belterra Park property and excess land at certain locations) into the Company, a newly formed subsidiary initially named PNK Entertainment, Inc., and distributed to its stockholders, on a pro rata basis, all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (such distribution referred to as the “Spin-Off”). As a result, Former Pinnacle stockholders received one share of the Company’s common stock, with a par value of $0.01 per share, for each share of Former Pinnacle common stock that they owned. Gold Merger Sub, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of GLPI (“Merger Sub”), then merged with and into Former Pinnacle (the “Merger”), with Merger Sub surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of GLPI. Immediately following the Merger, the Company was renamed Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. 
In connection with the Spin-Off and Merger, we entered into a triple-net master lease agreement for the fourteen gaming facilities acquired by GLPI (the “Master Lease”). The Master Lease has an initial term of 10 years with five subsequent, five-year renewal periods at our option. 
Acquisition of the Meadows Business 
On September 9, 2016, we closed on a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with GLP Capital, L.P. (“GLPC”), a subsidiary of GLPI, pursuant to which we acquired all of the equity interests of the Meadows located in Washington, Pennsylvania for base consideration of $138.0 million, subject to certain adjustments. The purchase price, after giving effect to such adjustments, was $134.0 million. As a result of the transaction, we own and operate the Meadows’ gaming, entertainment and harness racing business subject to a triple-net lease of its underlying real estate with GLPI (the “Meadows Lease” and collectively with the Master Lease, the “Leases”).

Other Assets and Operations

We own and operate the Heartland Poker Tour, which is a live and televised poker tournament series.
We own 75.5% of the equity of Pinnacle Retama Partners, LLC, which is the owner of the racing license utilized in the operation of Retama Park Racetrack. We also have a management contract with Retama Development Corporation to manage the day-to-day operations of Retama Park Racetrack.
Financial information about segments and geographic areas is incorporated by reference from Note 13, “Segment Information,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
We face significant competition in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such competition may intensify in some of these jurisdictions if new gaming operations open in these markets or existing competitors expand their operations. Our businesses compete directly with other gaming businesses in each state in which we operate, as well as businesses in other states. We also compete for customers with other casino operators in other markets, including casinos located on Native American reservations, and other forms of gaming, such as lotteries and internet gaming. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater name recognition and marketing and financial resources. In some instances, particularly with Native American casinos, our competitors pay substantially lower taxes or no taxes at all, as compared to us. We believe that increased legalized gaming in certain states, particularly in areas close to where our existing gaming businesses are located; the development or expansion of Native American gaming in or near the states in which we operate; and the potential legalization of internet gaming could create additional competition for us and could adversely affect our operations or proposed development projects.
Government Regulation and Gaming Issues
The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must obtain and maintain certain licenses to continue our operations. Each of the casinos on which we operate is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. For a more detailed description of the statutes and regulations to which we are subject, please see Exhibit 99.1, “Government Regulation and Gaming Issues,” to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results.
Compliance with federal, state and local provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment have not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive positions of our properties. From time to time, certain development projects may require substantial costs for environmental remediation due to prior use of our development sites. Our project budgets for such a site typically include amounts expected to cover the remediation work required.
