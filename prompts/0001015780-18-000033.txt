COMPETITION

The online financial services industry continues to evolve and remains highly competitive. Our core brokerage business competes with full service, discount, and online brokerage firms, Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs), finance technology start-ups, internet banks, and retail banks and thrifts. Some of these competitors provide online trading and banking services, investment advisor services, robo-advice capabilities, electronic bill payment services and a host of other financial products. 
Competition in the financial services industry continues to intensify, particularly amid continued consolidation and recent declines in commission pricing. The proliferation of emerging financial technology start-ups further evidences the continued shift to digital offerings. Our future success will depend upon our ability to continue providing digitally compelling and easy to use products and solutions to retail customers.
We also face competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to compete effectively in financial services will depend upon our ability to attract new employees, and retain and motivate our existing employees while efficiently managing compensation-related costs.

REGULATION

Our business is subject to regulation, primarily by US federal and state regulatory agencies and certain SROs, such as central banks and securities exchanges, that have been charged with the protection of the financial markets and the interests of those participating in those markets. We, along with other larger institutions, have been subject to a broad range of rules and regulations and a climate of heightened regulatory scrutiny, particularly with respect to compliance with laws and regulations, including controls and business processes. This scrutiny and related rule-making has resulted in part from the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) in 2010, which significantly changed the bank regulatory structure of our Company and its thrift subsidiaries. The substance and full impact of the laws and regulations to which we are subject may be affected by changes in the US political landscape, and we expect to continue to incur costs to implement new or phase-in requirements and monitor for continued compliance. For additional regulatory information on our brokerage and banking regulations, see MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 18—Regulatory Requirements.
Financial Services Regulation
Our regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that our customer privacy, data protection, information security and cyber security-related policies and practices are adequate to inform consumers of our data collection, use, sharing or security practices, to provide them with choices, if required, about how we use and share their information, and to safeguard their personal information. We maintain systems designed to comply with these privacy, data protection, information security and cyber security requirements, including procedures designed to securely process, transmit and store confidential information and protect against unauthorized access to such information. 
Our brokerage and banking entities are required by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 to disclose their privacy policies and practices related to sharing customer information with affiliates and non-affiliates. These rules give customers the ability to "opt out" of having non-public information disclosed to third parties or receiving marketing solicitations from affiliates and non-affiliates based on non-public information received from our brokerage and banking entities. The Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT ACT of 2001 (BSA/USA PATRIOT Act), applies to our brokerage and banking entities and requires financial institutions to develop anti-money laundering (AML) programs to assist in the prevention and detection of money laundering and combating terrorism. In order to comply with the BSA/USA PATRIOT Act, we have an AML department that is responsible for developing and implementing our enterprise-wide programs for compliance with the various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and 
E*TRADE 2017 10-K | Page 6



regulations. Our brokerage and banking entities are also subject to US sanctions laws administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and we have policies and procedures in place to comply with these laws.
Savings and Loan Holding Company and Bank Regulation
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board, and together with the twelve Federal Reserve Banks, the Federal Reserve) has primary jurisdiction for the supervision and regulation of savings and loan holding companies, including the Company. We are required to file periodic reports with the Federal Reserve and are subject to its examination and supervision. The Federal Reserve Board has issued guidance aligning the supervisory and regulatory standards of savings and loan holding companies more closely with the standards applicable to bank holding companies on such matters as liquidity risk management, securitizations, operational risk management, internal controls and audit systems, business continuity and compensation and other employee benefits. 
Our banking entities are regulated, supervised, and examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and the FDIC. The banking entities are also subject to regulation and various requirements and restrictions under state and other federal laws. Such regulation covers all aspects of the banking business, including lending practices, safeguarding deposits, customer privacy and information security, capital structure, transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel.
In certain circumstances, each of our banking entities may be subject to restrictions on its ability to declare dividends or make capital distributions and may be required to provide notice, submit applications or requests for non-objection from the OCC or the Federal Reserve in connection with a planned capital distribution. A savings and loan holding company, such as the Company, is also required to notify and consult with the Federal Reserve in advance of taking capital actions when, among other things, doing so could create safety and soundness concerns or the savings and loan holding company is experiencing financial weakness. 
The US Basel III framework for the calculation of a banking organization’s regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets became effective for us and for our savings association subsidiaries on January 1, 2015, subject to a phase-in period for certain requirements over several years. The Basel III rule established Common Equity Tier 1 capital as a new tier of capital, raised the minimum thresholds for required capital, increased minimum required risk-based capital ratios, narrowed the eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments, provided for new regulatory capital deductions and adjustments, and modified methods for calculating risk-weighted assets. A capital conservation buffer was also introduced, which limits a banking organization’s ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if it fails to maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of at least 2.5%, on a fully phased-in basis, of total risk-weighted assets above certain minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements. This requirement was effective beginning on January 1, 2016, and will be fully phased-in by 2019. In addition, certain deductions from and adjustments to regulatory capital are subject to phase-in over a four year period that began in 2015. The majority of these deductions are scheduled for full implementation in 2018; however, federal banking agencies recently finalized a rule that extended the existing capital requirements for certain items, including certain deferred tax assets. This extension is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's capital ratios and we expect to remain compliant with the Basel III framework as it is phased-in.
The FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 requires the appropriate federal banking regulator to take "prompt corrective action" with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. While these regulations generally apply only to banks, such as E*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Savings Bank, the Federal Reserve is authorized to take appropriate action against a parent savings and loan holding company, such as the Company, based on the undercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary. In certain instances, we would be required to guarantee the performance of a capital restoration plan if either of our bank subsidiaries were undercapitalized.

The Company has historically not been subject to certain regulatory requirements that apply to banking organizations with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, as defined by each applicable regulation. Total consolidated assets of $50 billion, which is generally measured on the basis of the average of the four most recent quarters, is a meaningful regulatory threshold, as US banking organizations become subject to a number of additional, and in some cases more stringent, regulatory requirements once they reach that size. The Company surpassed $50 billion in total consolidated assets on a four-quarter average in the first quarter of 2017 and we are continuing to implement policies, procedures, systems and governance structures that are designed to comply with requirements that will become applicable to the Company. The Company is continuing to monitor for regulatory developments as certain regulatory requirements are not yet final or not yet applicable to savings and loan holding companies. 
Capital Stress Testing
E*TRADE Bank, as a federal savings association with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion, is required to conduct annual company-run stress tests using certain regulator-specified scenarios (baseline, adverse and severely adverse), report the results to the OCC, and publicly disclose a summary of results for the severely adverse scenario. E*TRADE Bank conducted its annual stress test using financial statement data as of December 31, 2016, reported the stress test results to the OCC in July 2017, and publicly disclosed a summary of results for the severely adverse scenario in October 2017. The timeline for E*TRADE Bank's stress test reporting to the OCC for 2018 will be the same as that for 2017. 
The Company became subject to the annual company-run stress tests requirement in 2017. The Company conducted its first annual stress test using financial statement data as of December 31, 2016, as required by Federal Reserve Board Regulations, reported the stress test results to the Federal Reserve in July 2017, and publicly disclosed a summary of results for the severely adverse scenario in October 2017. For 2018, the Company will be required to complete and report the annual company-run stress test results to the Federal Reserve Board in April 2018 and publicly disclose a summary of results for the severely adverse scenario in June 2018. 
As a savings and loan holding company, the Company is not currently subject to the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process conducted pursuant to the Federal Reserve Board's capital plan rule. The Company may be subject to CCAR requirements in the future based on potential changes in regulations. 
Liquidity Requirements
Large banking organizations are subject to a quantitative liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement, which required banking organizations to hold minimum amounts of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) based on a percentage of their net cash outflows over a 30-day period as projected under the LCR rule. Banking organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or foreign exposures of $10 billion or more are subject to full LCR requirements. Bank and savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more but less than $250 billion, based on the average of the four most recent quarters, that do not have foreign exposures of $10 billion or more, such as the Company, are subject to a modified LCR rule requiring them to hold HQLA in an amount equal to at least 70% of their projected net cash outflows over a 30-day period. As a result of the Company's balance sheet growth, we will be subject to the modified LCR requirement beginning April 1, 2018. The Company believes the LCR is an important measure of liquidity and has been managing against it in preparation for the applicability of these requirements. In addition, beginning October 1, 2019, we will be required to disclose certain quantitative and qualitative information related to our LCR calculation after each calendar quarter.
In addition to the modified LCR rule, the Company may in the future be required to comply with rules proposed by the Federal Reserve Board in May 2016 that would impose a net stable funding requirement, the net stable funding ratio (NSFR). The proposed NSFR requirement would require a banking organization subject to the rule to maintain a minimum acceptable level of stable funding based on its liquidity 
E*TRADE 2017 10-K | Page 8



characteristics over a one-year time horizon. The proposal contemplates an effective date of January 1, 2018; however, the proposal has yet to be finalized.
Resolution and Recovery Plans
In 2012, the FDIC issued a final rule requiring insured depository institutions with total assets of $50 billion or more, based on the average of the four most recent quarters, to submit to the FDIC periodic plans providing for their resolution by the FDIC in the event of failure (resolution plans) under the receivership and liquidation provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. E*TRADE Bank is currently not subject to these rules, but if it were to exceed the asset threshold, it would be required to file with the FDIC an annual resolution plan demonstrating how it could be resolved in an orderly and timely manner in the event of receivership such that the FDIC would be able to ensure the bank's depositors receive access to their deposits within one business day, to maximize the net present value of the bank's assets when disposed of, and to minimize losses incurred by the bank's creditors. There is a separate resolution plan requirement for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more; however, the Company is not subject to this rule due to its status as a savings and loan holding company.
In September 2016, the OCC published final guidelines that establish standards for recovery planning for federal savings associations with average total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, based on the average of the four most recent quarters. E*TRADE Bank is currently not subject to these guidelines, but if it were to exceed the asset threshold, it would be required to develop and maintain a recovery plan for identifying and responding rapidly to significant stress events that could affect its financial condition and threaten its viability. The recovery plan would need to identify triggers for escalation of information to senior management and the board of directors, identify a wide range of viable options that E*TRADE Bank could undertake in response to severe stress, and be integrated into E*TRADE Bank’s risk governance function.
Federal Deposit Insurance and Related Assessments
The FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) provides insurance coverage for certain deposits, generally up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank and per account ownership type, and is funded by quarterly assessments on insured depository institutions. Each of our banking entities has deposits insured by the FDIC and pays quarterly assessments to the DIF, maintained by the FDIC, for this insurance coverage. On March 25, 2016, the FDIC published its final rule to add a surcharge to the regular DIF assessments of banks with $10 billion or more in assets, which includes E*TRADE Bank. Under the final rule, E*TRADE Bank is subject to an additional surcharge applied to its assessment base, which took effect for the assessment period beginning on July 1, 2016. Surcharges at an annual rate of 4.5 basis points will be assessed until the sooner of (1) the DIF attaining the minimum reserve ratio of 1.35 percent of insured deposits or (2) the fourth quarter of 2018. The FDIC anticipates eight quarters of surcharge assessments. There may be a one-time “shortfall assessment” in the first quarter of 2019 to bring the fund immediately to 1.35 percent if needed. The surcharge has not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
Home Owners' Loan Act
Under the Home Owners’ Loan Act, the OCC requires E*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Savings Bank to comply with the qualified thrift lender (QTL) test. Under the QTL test, a federal savings association is required to maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” (defined as the savings association’s total assets less the sum of: (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (ii) intangibles, including goodwill; and (iii) the value of property used to conduct its business) in certain “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed securities, credit card loans, student loans and small business loans) in at least nine months of the most recent 12-month period. E*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Savings Bank currently meet that test. A savings association that fails to meet the QTL test is subject to certain operating restrictions and may be required to convert to a national bank charter.

Brokerage Regulation and Capital Requirements
Our US broker-dealer, E*TRADE Securities, is registered with the SEC and is subject to regulation by the SEC and by SROs, such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the securities exchanges of which it is a member, as well as various state regulators. In addition, our FCM subsidiary, E*TRADE Futures, is registered with the CFTC and is a member of the NFA. E*TRADE Capital Management, LLC, is registered with the SEC and is subject to regulation as such by the SEC as well as various state regulators.
Brokerage regulation covers various aspects of brokerage activities, including segregated cash requirements and net capital. E*TRADE Securities carries security accounts for customers and maintains segregated cash and investments pursuant to Rule 15c3-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. E*TRADE Futures maintains cash deposits that have been segregated or secured for the benefit of futures clients pursuant to CFTC regulations governing FCMs. E*TRADE Securities is subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule, Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, and E*TRADE Futures is subject to CFTC net capital requirements. Brokerage regulation also covers other brokerage activities, including required books and records, safekeeping of funds and securities, trading, prohibited transactions, public offerings, margin lending, customer qualifications for margin and options transactions, registration of personnel and transactions with affiliates.
In April 2016, the US Department of Labor (DOL) published its final Conflicts of Interest Rule- Retirement Investment Advice regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Fiduciary Rule). Certain aspects of the Fiduciary Rule became applicable in June 2017. The Fiduciary Rule generally subjects particular persons, such as broker-dealers and other financial advisers providing investment advice to individual retirement accounts and other qualified retirement plans and accounts, to fiduciary duties and additional regulatory restrictions for a wider range of customer interactions. The DOL extended the transition period for the remaining aspects of the Fiduciary Rule, currently scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2019. During this transition period, the DOL has indicated that it will not take enforcement actions against impacted parties that are in reasonable and good faith compliance with the regulations.
