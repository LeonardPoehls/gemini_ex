The Company 
DCT Industrial Trust Inc. is a leading industrial real estate company specializing in the ownership, acquisition, development, leasing and management of bulk-distribution and light-industrial properties located in high-demand distribution markets in the United States. DCT's actively managed portfolio is strategically located near population centers and well-positioned to take advantage of market dynamics. As used herein, the terms “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to DCT Industrial Trust Inc. and its subsidiaries, including its operating partnership, DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP. When we use the term “DCT” or “DCT Industrial,” we are referring to DCT Industrial Trust Inc. by itself, and not including any of its subsidiaries, and when we use the term “Operating Partnership,” we are referring to DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP by itself, and not including any of its subsidiaries. 
DCT was formed as a Maryland corporation in April 2002 and has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our current and future business is, and will be, conducted through a majority owned and controlled subsidiary, DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP, a Delaware limited partnership, for which DCT is the sole general partner. DCT owns properties through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2016, DCT owned approximately 96.3% of the outstanding equity interests in the Operating Partnership. 
On November 17, 2014, we completed a one-for-four reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock and a corresponding reverse split of the partnership interests of the Operating Partnership.  The number of authorized shares and the par value of the common stock were not changed. All common stock/unit and per share/unit data for all periods presented in this annual report on Form 10-K have been restated to give effect to the reverse stock split.

Business Overview 
Our portfolio primarily consists of high-quality, bulk-distribution and light-industrial warehouses. The properties we target for acquisition or development are generally characterized by convenient access to major transportation arteries, proximity to densely populated markets and quality design standards that allow our customers’ efficient and flexible use of the buildings. In the future, we intend to continue focusing on properties that exhibit these characteristics in select U.S. markets where we believe we can achieve favorable returns and leverage our local expertise. We seek to maximize growth in earnings and shareholder value within the context of overall economic conditions, primarily through increasing occupancy, rents and operating income at existing properties and acquiring and developing high-quality properties with attractive operating income and value growth prospects. In addition, we will recycle our capital by disposing of non-strategic, lower growth assets and reinvesting the proceeds into newly acquired or developed assets where we believe the returns will be more favorable over time. 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company owned interests in approximately 74.0 million square feet of properties leased to approximately 900 customers, including:

• | 64.7 million square feet comprising 401 consolidated operating properties that were 97.2% occupied;


• | 7.8 million square feet comprising 23 unconsolidated properties that were 97.8% occupied and which we operated on behalf of two institutional capital management partners and an unconsolidated joint venture;


• | 0.3 million square feet comprising three consolidated properties under redevelopment; and


• | 1.2 million square feet comprising four consolidated properties which are shell-complete and in lease-up.

In addition, the Company has 10 projects under construction and several projects in pre-development. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3 – Investment in Properties" for further details.

As of December 31, 2016, our total consolidated portfolio consisted of 408 properties with an average size of 162,000 square feet and an average age of 22 years. 
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we acquired eight buildings. These properties were acquired for a total purchase price of approximately $84.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold 15 consolidated operating properties to third-parties for gross proceeds of approximately $128.7 million. We recognized gains of approximately $49.9 million on the disposition of these properties. 
We have a broadly diversified customer base. As of December 31, 2016, our consolidated properties had leases with approximately 900 customers with no single customer accounting for more than 3.5% of the total annualized base rent of our properties. Our 10 largest customers occupy approximately 17.2% of our consolidated properties based on square footage and account for approximately 17.5% of our annualized base rent of these properties. We believe that our broad national presence in the top U.S. distribution markets provides geographic diversity and is attractive to users of distribution space which allows us to build strong relationships with our customers. Furthermore, we are actively engaged in meeting our customers’ expansion and relocation requirements. 
Our principal executive office is located at 555 17th Street, Suite 3700, Denver, Colorado 80202; our telephone number is (303) 597-2400. We also maintain regional offices in Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois and Newport Beach, California and market offices in Baltimore, Maryland; Cincinnati, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Houston, Texas; Paramus, New Jersey; Emeryville, California; Orlando, Florida; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Seattle, Washington.

Business Strategy 
Our primary business objectives are to maximize long-term growth in Funds From Operations, or FFO, per share (see definition in “Selected Financial Data”), net asset value of our portfolio and total shareholder returns. In our pursuit of these long-term objectives, we seek to: 

• | Maximizing Cash Flows From Existing Properties. We intend to maximize the cash flows from our existing properties by active leasing and management, maintaining strong customer relationships, controlling operating expenses and physically maintaining the quality of our properties. Renewing tenants, leasing space and effectively managing expenses are critical to achieving our objectives and are a primary focus of our local real estate teams.


• | Selectively Pursuing New Development. To create value and enhance the quality of our portfolio, we expect to continue developing new assets in select markets where strong tenant demand, rents and vacancy levels demonstrate the need for new construction at returns that make sense for the Company. During 2016, we acquired seven land parcels for future development totaling approximately 130.5 acres and we commenced construction on 13 development and redevelopment buildings comprising 3.7 million square feet with a projected investment of $253.2 million. In 2016, we also stabilized 19 development and redevelopment buildings totaling 5.8 million square feet. As of December 31, 2016, there were four shell-complete buildings under development totaling 1.2 million square feet and 10 projects under construction totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet. All of the buildings under construction are projected to be completed during 2017.


• | Profitably Acquiring Properties. We seek to acquire properties that meet our asset, location and financial criteria at prices and potential returns which we believe are attractive. We have selected certain markets and sub-markets where we focus our efforts on identifying buildings to acquire.


• | Recycling Capital. We intend to selectively dispose of non-strategic assets and redeploy the proceeds into higher growth acquisition and development opportunities. In 2016, we sold 15 consolidated non-strategic operating properties for gross proceeds of approximately $128.7 million. The proceeds have been designated for deployment into higher growth assets.


• | Conservatively Managing Our Balance Sheet. We plan to maintain financial metrics, including leverage and coverage ratios on a basis consistent with our investment grade ratings. In addition, we believe that a conservatively managed balance sheet provides for a competitive long-term cost of capital.

Our Competitive Strengths 
We believe that we distinguish ourselves from other owners, operators, acquirers and developers of industrial properties through the following competitive strengths: 

• | High-Quality Industrial Property Portfolio. Our portfolio of industrial properties primarily consists of high-quality bulk-distribution facilities in high demand leasing markets. Our properties are specifically designed to meet the warehousing needs of local, regional and national companies. The majority of our properties are readily divisible to take advantage of re-tenanting opportunities. We believe that our concentration of high-quality bulk-distribution properties provides us with a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining distribution users across the markets in which we operate.


• | Experienced and Committed Management Team. Our executive management team collectively has an average of nearly 29 years of commercial real estate experience and 18 years of industrial real estate experience. Additionally, our executive management team has extensive public company operating experience.


• | Strong Operating Platform. We have a team of approximately 90 experienced transaction and property management professionals working in 13 offices to maximize market opportunities through local expertise, presence and relationships. We believe successfully meeting the needs of our customers and anticipating and responding to market opportunities will result in achieving superior returns from our properties as well as through the sourcing of new acquisitions and development opportunities.


• | Extensive Development and Redevelopment Expertise. Our local market teams have significant experience in all facets of value-add activities including development and redevelopment capabilities. We believe our local teams’ knowledge of our focus markets and their relationships with key market participants, including land owners, users and brokers, combined with the technical expertise required to successfully execute on complex transactions, provides us with an excellent platform to create value while appropriately managing risk.


• | Proven Acquisition and Disposition Capabilities. The Company has extensive experience in acquiring industrial real estate, including both smaller transactions as well as larger portfolio acquisitions. Our local market teams are an important advantage in sourcing potential marketed as well as off-market transactions. The average size of our acquisitions since 2012 is $15.1 million, demonstrating our ability to access a significant pipeline of smaller acquisitions. Further, consistent with our capital recycling strategy, we have disposed of a cumulative $2.1 billion of real estate investments since the inception of the Company.


• | Strong Industry Relationships. We believe that our extensive network of industry relationships with the brokerage and investor communities will allow us to execute successfully our development, acquisition and capital recycling strategies. These relationships augment our ability to source acquisitions in off-market transactions outside of competitive marketing processes, capitalize on development opportunities and capture repeat business and transaction activity. Our strong relationships with local and nationally focused brokers aids in attracting and retaining customers.


• | Capital Structure. Our capital structure provides us with sufficient financial flexibility and capacity to fund future growth. As of December 31, 2016, we had $323.1 million available under our $400.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility, net of two letters of credit totaling $1.9 million. As of December 31, 2016, 355 of our consolidated properties with a gross book value of $3.8 billion were unencumbered. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we also issued approximately 2.5 million shares of common stock through the continuous equity offering program, at a weighted average price of $43.98 per share for proceeds of approximately $107.0 million, net of offering expenses.

Operating Segments 
Our operating results used to assess performance are aggregated into three reportable segments, East, Central and West, which are based on the geographical locations organized into markets where our management and operating teams conduct and monitor business. We consider rental revenues and property net operating income aggregated by segment to be the appropriate way to analyze performance. See additional information in “Item 2. Properties” and in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14 – Segment Information.”

Competition 
The market for the leasing of industrial real estate is highly competitive. We experience competition for customers from other existing assets in proximity to our buildings as well as from new development. Institutional investors, other REITs and local real estate operators generally own such properties; however, no single competitor or small group of competitors is dominant in our current markets. However, as a result of competition, we may have to provide concessions, incur charges for tenant improvements or offer other inducements, all of which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
The market for the acquisition of industrial real estate is also very competitive. We compete for real property investments with other REITs and institutional investors such as pension funds and their advisors, private real estate investment funds, insurance company investment accounts, private investment companies, individuals and other entities engaged in real estate investment activities, some of which have greater financial resources than we do. 
Environmental Matters 
We are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition. Either the previous owners or we subjected a majority of the properties we have acquired, including land, to environmental reviews. While some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling, none of the environmental assessments has revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for additional information. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 146 full-time employees.
