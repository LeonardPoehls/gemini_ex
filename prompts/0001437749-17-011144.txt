Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Determine, Inc. is a leading global provider of SaaS Source-to-Pay and Enterprise Contract Lifecycle Management (“ECLM”) solutions. The Determine Cloud Platform provides procurement, sourcing, finance and legal professionals with the flexibility, agility and scalability they need to optimize spend, supplier, contract and financial performance goals. We empower users across the full source-to-pay continuum, including sourcing, supplier management, contract management and procure-to-pay applications, to deliver efficiency and data insight for their operational business processes, third-party relationships and contractual obligations.
 
Our Vision: To be the global leader of cloud solutions empowering organizations to make more informed decisions from their proprietary data.
 
Our Mission: To provide industry leading cloud solutions to maximize our customers’ visibility and financial return from their spend, supplier and contractual data.
 
Our name, Determine, stands for delivering conclusions through analysis. Using our expertise and experience to simplify business complexities with business processes, we help customers successfully turn pain points into insights and challenges into bottom-line results.
 
On July 2, 2014, we completed our acquisition of Iasta.com, Inc. and Iasta Resources, Inc. (together “Iasta”), both Indiana corporations. The acquisition of Iasta allowed us to provide easier access to contract management, strategic sourcing and spend management, and increased our market coverage in locations worldwide.
 
On July 31, 2015, we completed the acquisition of b-pack SAS (“b-pack”), a French societe par actions simplifiee. The acquisition provided us source-to-pay solutions focused on providing end-to-end procurement capabilities, including eProcurement, purchase-to-pay, asset management, budget management, invoice management and expense management.
 
On October 15, 2015, we amended our Certificate of Incorporation and amended and restated our Bylaws to change our name from Selectica, Inc. to Determine, Inc., which became effective immediately. Our common stock began trading under the ticker symbol “DTRM” on October 19, 2015.
 


In rebranding as Determine in October of 2015, we formally combined three legacy industry leaders and brands — Selectica, Iasta and b-pack — under one new name, and continue to accelerate the execution of our strategic plan. As of the end of the second quarter of our fiscal year 2017, our new customers are choosing to leverage the Determine Cloud Platform and the flexibility, scalability, data visibility and process efficiency it provides.
 
Determine serves more than 250 global customers spanning a wide spectrum of industries including, but not limited to, financial services, insurance, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, retail, transportation and manufacturing. In a global economic climate with increasing uncertainty and volatility, organizational flexibility and agility remain paramount. Customers are looking for innovative technology tools, thinking and expertise that can help them streamline processes to drive operational efficiency, align functions and leverage the enormous untapped value in their organizational data. Determine delivers a “now and later” platform - a modular approach that solves immediate challenges, but enables growth as needs dictate.
 
Customers use our solutions to discover previously unseen supplier, contractual and spend data to maximize savings, drive new revenue, control costs, improve workflow efficiencies, mitigate risks and make more informed and smarter business decisions.

The Determine Cloud Platform
 
We empower global businesses to translate source-to-pay technology into results. Unlike point solutions, suites or “cobbled-together” platforms, our modular solutions are built around a robust and highly configurable business-centric technology, the Determine Cloud Platform.
The Determine Core
 
The unique power of our Determine Cloud Platform emanates from the Determine Core.
 
Determine offers a common, reliable and powerful engine at the heart of its multi-tenant cloud platform. The Determine Core is the foundational building block of the Determine Cloud Platform, and is what empowers customers to stay focused on streamlining their business processes across functions. It is the basis for how the platform integrates proprietary master database, metadata with our business process engine to provide a single source of data truth across a customer’s entire business enterprise. It also optimizes the functionality of our solutions through embedded analytics, open application programming interface (“API”) and a business network that combine to provide end-to-end solution visibility and control.
 
Simplified implementation and configuration, and seamless integration with existing ERP and other enterprise systems, empowers collaboration, efficiency and agility. By using our SaaS applications built on the Determine Cloud Platform, business stakeholders at all levels of the organization are empowered to collaborate and make more accurate and confident decisions.
 

The Determine Core works for our customers by:
 

● | Leveraging dynamic process and workflow capability to easily accommodate different buying patterns required for managing complex category spend related product to services.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Providing an easily accessible platform to search, identify and report on procurement-related activities from sourcing, contract management, purchasing and invoicing.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Providing a foundation based on responsive design and mobility that will enable a wider set of users to use the system for promoting usage and compliance.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Providing an easily accessible approach for improving insights for managing compliance related to both internal and external audit activities.

● | Sourcing — Our sourcing solution provides robust sourcing tools, from onboarding and validation, to managing sourcing requirements that are integrated with source-to-pay. Our eSourcing applications help organizations solicit and evaluate information and proposals, while supporting "project" bidding through live events, where the outcomes can have immediate, long-term impact on their businesses. Determine helps simplify the large-scale, complex bid events with thousands of line items and awards spanning multiple suppliers. In addition, Determine helps customers meet operational sourcing needs, such as price checks or requests for quote, using information from our procure-to-pay capabilities on the integrated Determine Cloud Platform.

By managing contracts on one comprehensive platform, Determine optimizes shared data, giving all contract stakeholders new insights into their commercial counterparty relationships.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Invoice Management — Our invoice management solution makes invoicing faster, more accurate, more compliant and automated. End-to-end process automation results in higher accuracy, time savings, enhanced spend control, improved cash flow, working capital optimization and reduced outstanding receivables for suppliers. Determine helps improve productivity by eliminating redundant data entry, accelerating the invoice-to-payment cycle and enabling simple resolution of matching errors and exceptions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Financial Management — Our financial management solution empowers customers to drive and control spend on a long-term and day-to-day basis by automating and translating spend into budget management efforts. Through real time spend to budget analysis, departments can confirm or correctly align with financial and organizational goals. Consolidating budgets, cost centers, general ledger accounts and analytic code data on one comprehensive platform empowers financial leaders to make informed decisions about budget and spend management forecasting.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Supplier Management — Our supplier management solution provides companies with a portfolio of supplier capabilities from onboarding and validation, to score-carding, KPI performance measurement, risk management and more. Supplier master data management, metadata tagging, business process engine and configurable business apps empower departments to extend their agile process beyond the post-procurement role. Through accelerated digitization and innovation, we help customers build supplier relationships that build business.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Business Applications — Determine provides business applications with enhanced tools and flexibility to take advantage of other solution areas outside of source to pay, to get even more functionality out of our integrated platform and achieve greater business results. Our configurable and flexible technology makes it simple to add business applications for managing additional business needs.

The Determine Cloud Platform integrates with focused providers in areas including CRM, e-signatures, document management, external market data, and other business platforms.

Employees
 
As of March 31, 2017, we had a total of 148 employees, 8 of which are located in the United Kingdom, 47 of which are located in France and 93 of which are located in the United States. Of the total, 36 are full-time product and technical writing specialists engaged in research and development, 63 are engaged in professional services, 27 are engaged in sales and marketing, and 22 are engaged in general and administrative. We also have 76 individuals contracted through our Odessa, Ukraine facility, with 21 in professional service and 55 engineers in research and development. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Determine Professional Services
 
We offer a range of services to ensure that the solutions meet users’ requirements. Our Professional Services team takes a best-practice, collaborative approach, applying their extensive experience with contract lifecycle management, strategic sourcing, procure to pay and Configuration solutions. We provide these services using both our in-house expertise and that of third parties experienced in our solutions acting under our direction. 
Sales and Marketing
 
We sell our cloud solutions primarily through our direct sales force along with strategic and OEM partners.
 
Our direct sales force is complemented by business partners, supported by telesales and system engineering resources. We have developed programs to attract and retain high quality, motivated sales representatives that have the necessary technical skills and consultative sales experience. We have also developed specific partner relationships to expand our solutions and domain expertise into various targeted markets. We believe that the cultivation and integration of these support networks assists in both the establishment and enhancement of customer relationships.
 
Our marketing department is engaged in revenue-centered, sales-support and brand awareness-building activities. We utilize lead generation programs including both inbound and outbound marketing with public relations, speaking programs, creation and production of thought leadership resources, event hosting and market analyst relations.
 
Research and Development
 
To date, we have invested substantial resources in research and development. Our team primarily works on product development, enhancements, documentation, and quality assurance. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, we invested approximately $5.6 million and $5.0 million, respectively, on research and development, inclusive of $1.8 million and $1.4 million capitalized research and development costs, respectively.
 
Enhancements to our existing products are released periodically to add new features, improve functionality and incorporate feedback and suggestions from our customers. These updates are usually provided as part of the product subscription or license arrangement.
 
International Operations
 
Since fiscal 2011, we maintained a relationship with a third-party operating a research and operations center in Odessa, Ukraine. This facility represents a significant investment for us as we continue to execute on our global expansion strategy. Our operations in Ukraine with our third-party partner have not been materially affected by the recent political events in that country, and we have put certain contingency plans in place to minimize any disruption.
Competition
 
The market for cloud-based software solutions in general, including Sourcing, Supplier Management, Procurement, and Contract Management and Configuration solutions, continues to rapidly change. Competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered. We encounter competition primarily from companies such as SAP, Apttus, Coupa, Ivalua and IBM, as well as (i) software companies that offer integrated solutions or specific products that compete with our ECLM Configuration solutions, (ii) information systems departments of potential or current customers that internally develop custom software, and (iii) professional services organizations. Some of these competitors are larger than us and may only compete in a segment of ours.

We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our market include product reputation, functionality, ease-of-use, ability to integrate with other products and technologies, quality, performance, price, customer service and support, and the vendors’ reputation. Although we believe that our products currently compete favorably with regard to such factors, we cannot assure that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors. Increased competition may result in price reductions, less beneficial contract terms, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
 
Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights
 
We rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology. These legal protections afford only limited protection for our technology. We currently hold eight patents in the United States. In addition, we have various trademarks registered or pending registration in various jurisdictions. Our trademark applications might not result in the issuance of any trademarks. Our patents or any future issued patents or trademarks might be invalidated or circumvented or otherwise fail to provide us any meaningful protection. We seek to protect the source code for our software, documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws. We license our software pursuant to license agreements, which impose certain restrictions on the licensee’s ability to utilize the software. We also seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Our failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
