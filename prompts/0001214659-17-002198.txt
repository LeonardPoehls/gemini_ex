ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General
 
Nexeon MedSystems Inc (“Nexeon”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”. “our”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 7, 2015. We are a development stage enterprise focusing on the development and commercialization of physician-driven, medical device innovations. Since incorporation, we have not made any significant sale of assets or generated any form of revenue.
Implications of Emerging Growth Company Status
 
As a company with less than $1 billion in revenue in our last fiscal year, we are defined as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (“JOBS”) Act.  We will retain “emerging growth company” status until the earliest of:

• | The last day of the fiscal year during which our annual revenues are equal to or exceed $1 billion; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | The last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first sale of common stock pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which we refer to in this document as the Securities Act; 
• | The date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in a previous three-year period; or 
• | The date on which we qualify as a large accelerated filer under Rule 12b-2 adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) (i.e., an issuer with a public float of $700 million that has been filing reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under the Exchange Act for at least 12 months).
• | As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to SEC reporting companies. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company we will not be required to: 
• | Have an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2002; 
• | Comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis); 
• | Submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder non-binding advisory votes; 
• | Submit for stockholder approval golden parachute payments not previously approved; 
• | Disclose certain executive compensation related items, as we will be subject to the scaled disclosure requirements of a smaller reporting company with respect to executive compensation disclosure; and 
• | Present more than two years of audited financial statements and two years of selected financial data in a registration statement for our initial public offering of our securities. 

 
Pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of The JOBS Act.  This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies.  As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.  Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt into the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.
 
Because the worldwide market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or public float, is below $75 million, we are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined under the Exchange Act.  Some of the foregoing reduced disclosure and other requirements are also available to us because we are a smaller reporting company and may continue to be available to us even after we are no longer an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act but remain a smaller reporting company under the Exchange Act.  As a smaller reporting company we are not required to:
 

• | Have an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Present more than two years of audited financial statements in our registration statements and annual reports on Form 10-K and present any selected financial data in such registration statements and annual reports.

 Merger 
 
 On February 16, 2016, Nexeon was the surviving entity following a merger with Nexeon MedSystems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NXDE”) (the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, 100% of NXDE’s issued and outstanding preferred shares were converted into 1,659,943 shares of the Company’s restricted Common Stock. All NXDE shares of Common Stock, Options, and Deferred Compensation Units were canceled. Also pursuant to the Merger, the Company shall pay a Three Percent (3%) royalty (the “NXDE royalty”) to a limited liability company (“NXDE LLC”) formed in connection with the Merger (of which the former NXDE shareholders are members) on Net Product Sales derived by the Company’s, or its affiliates’ or licensees’, commercialization of patents and intellectual property acquired by the Company through the Merger (see the section titled “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions” under Item 13 for more information).
 
Patents Acquired
 
Chief among the assets acquired by the Company in the Merger with NXDE was a 100% ownership interest in a portfolio of patents some of which relate to a micro-perforated balloon catheter system for use in the treatment of restenosis associated with hemodialysis. Initially, the Company will focus on driving development and commercialization of the aforementioned medical device. As part of this process, the Company will transfer the intellectual property obtained in the Merger to its wholly owned subsidiary known as Pulsus Medical LLC (“Pulsus”). Pulsus will enter into various other sub-license agreements as well as development and supply agreements in order to enhance the technology and expedite the development process. A list of the patents acquired in the Merger of NXDE is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to Amendment No. 4 to the Form 10 Registration Statement filed with the SEC on November 21, 2016. Additionally, the Company’s Officers and Directors, from time to time, will perform periodic due diligence on complimentary patents and companies, which it may acquire with an intent to develop and commercialize various medical technologies.
Fair Market Value of Assets Acquired
 
The Company engaged the independent third-party valuation consulting firm Intellectual Property Market Advisory Partners to provide a fair market value of the assets acquired in the acquisition of NXDE in accordance with ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements. The Founding Partner of Intellectual Property Market Advisory Partners, performed the fair market valuation of the patent portfolio acquired in the Merger. Management has relied on the fair market value reflected in the report provided to determine the fair value of the assets acquired in the Merger. Management believes the primary value of the acquisition is reflected in the patent portfolio acquired. The acquisition included a minimal amount of tangible physical assets. There was no In-Process research and development acquired.


 The three generally accepted approaches to estimate the value of a business entity are: (1) the income approach, (2) the market approach, and (3) the asset-based approach. Within each approach, there are several individual valuation methods. The approach used by the third-party valuation firm to estimate fair market value of the patents was the market approach. The estimated fair value for the patents acquired was $6,120,000.
 
The Company has reflected the liabilities acquired at book value which approximated management’s estimate of fair market value for these liabilities.
 
Management is has determined no impairment of the value for the patents has occurred since the initial fair market valuation.

Business Overview
 
 Nexeon is a bioelectronics company developing active medical devices for the treatment of chronic medical conditions. The solutions we are developing are a unique blend of traditional device technologies such as electronics, software, mechanical engineering, and material science, as well as pharmaceuticals, protein chemistry, and cell biology.
 
The Company has developed a novel balloon material that utilizes carbon nanotubes and polymer. This technology in addition to patents related to interventional cardiology products being developed by the Company are protected with nearly 36 patent matters.  Non-dilutive federal and state funding will enable the Company to develop the solution through a first in man study.  If successful, the approach reduces the need for follow up procedures by efficiently delivering anti-restenotic drugs, intravascularly, to direct the therapy immediately into the lesion.  We expect to develop a suite of passive and electrically- active drug eluting balloons in our wholly owned subsidiary Pulsus Medical, LLC.
 
In addition, The Company is developing and commercializing an implantable neurostimulation and recording platform. The platform is one of the very few implantable stimulation and recording devices that has received regulatory approval (CE conformity) for human use.
 
Key Transactions:
 
 
· | On February 16, 2016, the Company merged with NXDE. The Company was the surviving entity. The Company converted 100% of NXDE’s issued and outstanding common and preferred stock into 1,659,943 shares of the Company’s common stock. In addition to the conversion of NXDE shares into common shares of the Company, the Company agreed to pay a limited liability company formed by the former shareholders of NXDE for the purpose of receiving a royalty equal to three percent (3%) (the “NXDE royalty”) of Net Product Sales received by the Company, its affiliates and licensees derived from the commercialization of patents or other intellectual property owned by NXDE prior to the Merger. Those patents and other intellectual property will be spun-out into Pulsus Medical, LLC and serve as the basis for our balloon catheter product, which will be the first product we shall attempt to develop to commercialization.

Neurological Disease Markets Businesses Summary
 
In conjunction with the acquisition of NMB, Nexeon will be developing implantable neurotechnology to be applied for the relief of chronic diseases and disorders such as using deep brain stimulation (“DBS”). Central to Nexeon’s future products is an implantable neurostimulation and recording platform. The platform is one of the very few implantable stimulation and recording devices that has previously received regulatory approval in Europe (CE conformity) for human use.
 
The complete system is designed, developed, and validated according to ISO 14708-3 and ISO 10993 standards. The programmer software and all embedded software in the Implantable Pulse Generator, Remote Control and Battery Charger are compliant with the IEC 62304 standard.
 
Implantable Pulse Generator: The central component of the platform is a thin, implantable pulse generator (“IPG”) with soft contours that is designed for patient comfort and aesthetics. The IPG provides two connectors for electrode leads with up to eight contacts each. The leads are stretchable, though unbreakable, allowing for normal patient movement. The heart of the IPG is a custom chip designed to deliver current in multiple contacts independently and simultaneously, making it suitable for selective electrical stimulation. The chip also incorporates a recording system to measure local field and evoked potentials, or to monitor stimulation and the system’s integrity.
Remote Control and Battery Charger: The patient’s Remote Control (“RC”) allows the patient to start and stop the stimulation and to adjust the stimulation level within the limits given by the physician. A color screen gives feedback on the stimulation in the IPG (on or off, level) and on the IPG battery level using icons without text, making the system language independent. It warns the patient when the battery must be charged. To charge the IPG battery, the Battery Charger (“BC”) is placed over the implanted IPG using a shoulder harness, and the RC is connected to the BC. The RC continuously monitors charging voltage, current and temperature in the IPG and optimizes the inductive power generated by the BC for efficient charging. At the same time, the RC battery is charged too. The RC and IPG communicate with each other over a MICS wireless link. MICS wireless technology is suitable for remote monitoring of patients to collect user and usage information. A 3G/4G-enabled device can interrogate the IPG over the MICS link and stream the anonymous data to a central database.
Physician Programmer: A physician programmer allows the clinician to set IPG parameters for each patient and to check the integrity of the IPG and electrode leads. The programmer has a database that keeps individual patient records with all programmed parameters and recorded data.
Industry & Target Market
 
Deep Brain Stimulation Market Overview
 
DBS is the application of electrical pulses to specific target structures inside the brain. DBS has been used to treat about 85,000 patients worldwide, predominantly for neurological diseases with motor symptoms (Parkinson disease, essential tremor, and Dystonia) that are refractory to medical treatment.
 
Programming of the correct electrode-contact and optimizing the pulse setting is an inefficient approach. The neurologist has no feedback other than the clinical output for interpreting a patient’s state. We believe this trial-and-error method often results in sub-optimal parameters and is time consuming. The time commitment for the nurse, clinician and patient can exceed 40 hours in the first year of treatment.
 
 Funding & Development
 
NMB currently has €1,496,000 (approximately US $1,615,000) in remaining funds from previously awarded grants related to its implantable neurotechnology from the La Region Wallone in Belgium. The NMB grant revenues would be beneficial to the Company subject to completing the acquisition of NMB.

 Cardiovascular Disease Technology Business Summary
 
The Company is also developing an intravascular drug delivery system comprised of an inflatable Micro-Perforated Catheter Balloon. This balloon will be comprised of carbon nanotubes embedded within the host nylon polymer for increased mechanical strength. The technology has demonstrated only a small amount of carbon nanotubes (<5% by weight) is needed within the polymer to provide the necessary mechanical reinforcement to withstand high pressure (>20 Atmospheres, “ATM”). While high-pressure (>20 ATM) balloons are currently available, they are made from stiffer polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”) and are not perforated. Therefore, existing high-pressure balloons are not applicable. The carbon nanotubes help maintain structural integrity of the Micro-Perforated Catheter Balloon during inflation and drug delivery while allowing a more compliant polymer, such as nylon, to be used. Anti-restenotic drugs, such as paclitaxel, can then be delivered using pulsed flow. The drug is introduced through the proximal shaft of the catheter balloon. The drug, and carrier medium, then fills up the catheter balloon and is released through the pores in the catheter balloon. The drug then exits the catheter balloon and is forced into the surround neointima for maximal therapeutic effect.
 
When compared to drug-coated catheter balloons and drug-eluting stents, management believes the Company’s approach is expected to provide the following benefits:
 

• | No distal outflow occlusion due to no excipient needed 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Minimal downstream loss of drug 
• | Predictable depth and load of drug delivery 
• | Adjustable drug dosage based on clinical variables 
• | Ability to use wider range of drugs, including non-lipophilic drugs

Innovation
 
Current drug-coated balloons provide only passive drug delivery. In management’s opinion, this Micro-Perforated Catheter Balloon brings a much-needed, innovative improvement to intravascular drug delivery by enabling controllable pulsed flow delivery of anti-restenotic drugs to the diseased site. The specific innovations that are being developed include: 

• | Carbon nanotube-nylon composite materials and associated processing procedures to manufacture mechanically robust, micro-perforated catheter balloons
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | An intravascular method that can deliver lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs 

  
Advantages of our Approach

While our approach reduces the need for follow up procedures by efficiently delivering anti-restenotic drugs, intravascularly, to direct the therapy immediately into the lesion. Currently, repeat angioplasty procedures are required to continually counter restenosis. The need for compliant materials to perform intravascular drug delivery within the AV Graft site (Arteriovenous Graft is when a synthetic tube connects an artery to a vein) eliminates the use of stents for this application. While drug-coated catheter balloons could potentially be used to treat blockages in proximity to the AV Graft, the high flow rate associated with such grafts have the potential to wash out the drug. 
 
Commercial Applications
 
The targeted clinical application is as an intervention for hemodialysis graft failures, particularly in delivering paclitaxel or similar anti-restenotic drugs. Pulsed-flow intravascular drug delivery can also potentially be applied to bodily sites where drug-eluting stents and drug-coated balloons are being used, including the superficial femoral artery in the thigh and the popliteal artery in the knee (Pastromas et al. 2014). Management believes the technology has the ability to deliver almost any type of drug, and that this approach not only has the potential to treat many blockages within the peripheral vasculature but may also transcend to other diseases such as cancer. It is management’s belief drugs that are difficult or impossible to take orally or drugs that lose efficacy when taken by standard intravenous delivery could potentially be used much more effectively with the Company’s intravascular delivery system. Management believes, this approach may not only extend or broaden the useful life of existing drugs, but it may also revive interest in abandoned drugs.

 Production Plan
 
Production of the balloons will require contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) that implement Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) per FDA requirements. The balloon manufacturing partner, Interface Catheter Solutions, is well-versed in GMP procedures and it is management’s belief the manufacturing and testing procedures used in this effort will be readily scalable and GMP-compliant. Currently, Interface Catheter Solutions is a component vendor and no contract exists. We plan to use FDA-registered, GMP-compliant testing facilities at Nelson Laboratories to validate the biological safety of our materials. It is management’s belief these processes can be readily transferable to a strategic partner who could eventually market our catheter balloon. 
Funding & Development
 
During 2016, Rosellini Scientific, LLC (“RS”), an affiliate of the Company, transferred approximately $751,000 of Federal research grants applicable to Pulsus’ products to the Company. See sections titled “Liquidity and Capital Resources” under Item 7 and “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions” under Item 13. Pulsus has applied for Matching Funds from the Kentucky SBIR Matching Funds Program funded by the Cabinet for Economic Development (CED), Office of Entrepreneurship. The Kentucky Science and Technology Corporation (KSTC) administer the Kentucky SBIR Matching Funds Program under a contract with the CED. If the Kentucky Matching Funds applications are approved the state of Kentucky’s will award up to $150,000 associated with the NIH/SBIR Phase I Grant and up to $500,000 associated with the NIH/SBIR Phase II Grant. The Company and Pulsus have several additional NIH/SBIR Grant applications pending. NMB currently has a pending grant application in the amount of €1,203,000 (approximately US $1,299,000) from the La Region Wallone in Belgium. The NMB grant revenues would be beneficial to the Company subject to completing the acquisition of NMB.
 
Investments in research and development related to intravascular drug delivery system totaled $266,586 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.
 
As of March 29, 2017, we own 36 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications reflecting the intellectual property underlying the intravascular drug delivery system technology platform. The term of our individual patents depends on the legal terms for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. The majority of our patents will expire between 2020 and 2029.


Regulatory Plan
 
The Company intends to file for a CE Mark in the EU at the end of 2017 for the implantable neurostimulation and recording platform for the relief of Parkinson’s disease using DBS.  Nexeon intends to perfect its Technical File (including implementing its quality system, manufacturing and packaging procedures, labeling, sterilization, packaging, and performing any remaining testing, verification, and/or validation activities).  It is also Nexeon’s expectation that, while the NB may want Nexeon to conduct the clinical study that it reviewed at the outset of this process, the NB still will require only that this study be ongoing and progressing by the time that review of the Technical File is completed.  (In fact, while there have been some recent increases in the stringency of the relevant EU regulatory requirements, human clinical trial data still is not always necessary when pursuing such product approval via a CE Mark.)  Ultimately, then, this process is expected to take somewhere between three to six months, with issuance of a CE Mark early in Q1 2018.
 
The Company has had a number of discussions with FDA and intends to begin a pivotal study for DBS in the US in 2018.  Bench experiments and preclinical animal testing requirements are already in progress and will conclude in 2017 with the completion of an active safety in porcine.  Some of the biocompatibility testing may be replaced by published literature of the material being used.  Preclinical animal studies to demonstrate efficacy and functioning of the device may be, but are not always, a regulatory requirement.
 
The tests could include preclinical animal testing for cytotoxicity, sensitization, genotoxicity, and implantation biocompatibility.  Additional testing that may be applicable includes irritation or intracutaneous reactivity, acute system toxicity, and sub-chronic toxicity (sub-acute toxicity).  Supplementary evaluation testing that could be required includes testing for chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity. In lieu of some of these testing requirements, the regulatory submissions may be able to include published toxicity data on the lead material and/or provide justification or risk assessment for not conducting the appropriate tests.

The Company also intends to complete preclinical testing for the drug eluting balloon program in 2017 and expect to submit a clinical evaluation review request to the notified bodies in order to gain more information concerning the regulatory pathway of the program.  This will be done in conjunction with a pre-IDE meeting with the FDA.  The SBIR funding supports all preclinical work and ISO 13485 testing needed to complete preclinical safety analysis.
Sales Approach
 
Our strategy for sales and distribution will vary depending on product line and region. We expect to utilize a targeted sales approach for the DBS product while achieving a US PMA FDA approval.  We will hire a small, experienced sales force – all with prior experience of training 50+ clinicians on active implantable devices. Each will have previous sales of at least $1M annually and a wealth of contacts in their regional area.
 
Territories in the U.S. and E.U. not targeted by our sales force will be covered using a distributor to reduce upfront costs and training. This approach will likely be altered if we form a strategic partnership with an existing medical device company prior to first sales.
 
Intellectual Property Protection
 
Nexeon possesses a strong patent portfolio for each of its products under development ensuring the ability to operate, which is critical to successful commercialization of these platforms. In addition, maintaining a focus in the internet of medical things allows Nexeon to utilize issued and pending patents for maximum commercial benefit and growth. Since its inception, Nexeon has actively pursued patent coverage of the proprietary systems and methods of delivering therapy. The patents have been deliberately written to provide broad and specific protection.
 
Issued and pending US and foreign method and technology patents protect this intellectual property (IP) (Table 1).
 


Table 1: IP Portfolio with Patents Issued
 
Nexeon’s strategy is to protect proprietary positions by continuing to acquire and file US and foreign patent applications related to this technology, inventions, and improvements to enhance the business and competitive advantages. Continuing to rigorously analyze competitive IP applications and their prosecution history will ensure that this freedom to operate position remains viable. As development of new products and prosecution of pending patent applications progresses, we will continue to strategically file additional applications, including continuations, continuations-in-part, and divisional applications, to protect the new developments and those already being prosecuted.

Temporal Barrier to Others: The Company has thoroughly analyzed the patents, products, and therapies that may be considered competitive to the proposed system. Nexeon is committed to protecting its proprietary positions by continuing to file patent applications related to technology, inventions, and improvements to enhance their business and competitive advantages. As development of new products and prosecution of pending patent applications progresses, Nexeon will continue to strategically file additional applications to protect new developments.
 
In addition to seeking patent protection, the Company has utilized other available intellectual property rights to protect its developments. Nexeon utilizes copyrighted software, manuals, and reports. Nexeon also maintains a number of trade secrets that are essential to its business. Nexeon has implemented procedures to maintain such secrecy required of such trade secrets. Finally, Nexeon has filed for and obtained several trademark registrations related to the branding of its products. This multifaceted approach provides Nexeon with the maximum protection available for its developments.
 
Patent License Agreement (Siemens Patents)
 
On September 29, 2016, William Rosellini (“Licensee”), the Chief Executive Officer, a Director and a majority shareholder of the Company, entered into a patent license agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Magnus IP GmbH, incorporated and existing under the laws of Germany (“Magnus” or “Licensor”). Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, Magnus granted to Mr. Rosellini, and his “Affiliates” (an entity that Mr. Rosellini has ownership, directly or indirectly, of 50% or more of the voting equity of such entity), a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable without the right to sublicense worldwide license under the Licensed Patents (described below), to make, have made, use, import, export, distribute, sell, offer for sale, develop and advertise Licensed Products (described below), hereinafter referred to as the “Siemens Patents.”
 
The intellectual property relates to Internet-of-Things (“IOT”) technology as described by a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals, and/or people that have unique identifiers and a subsequent ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.  This technology can be utilized in a wide variety of medical device applications, most notably in hospitals, nursing facilities, or patients’ homes.
 
“Licensed Patents” means (i) the patents listed on the Exhibit A to the License Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 20, 2016; (ii) all divisions, continuations, continuations-in-part, reissues and reexaminations or extensions of the patents listed in (i) (whether U.S. or foreign); and (iii) no others. Licensed Patents does not include any patents owned or controlled by any Affiliate of Licensor.
“Licensed Products” means any medical device, system, or method designed, developed, marketed, and sold by Licensee that, in the absence of the License Agreement, would infringe at least one claim of the Licensed Patents.
Patent License Asset Purchase Agreement 
 
On December 15, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, Mr. Rosellini sold, assigned and transferred any and all of his right, title and interest in and to the License owned by him related to the Siemens Patents to the Company pursuant to the Patent License Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 20, 2016. A copy of the License Agreement is attached to the Purchase Agreement as Exhibit A. As consideration for the transfer of the Siemens Patents and the License related thereto, the Company paid to Mr. Rosellini the sum of $140,000 in cash and will issue to Mr. Rosellini 3,050,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock valued at $3,050,000. The Company has not yet issued the shares of restricted common stock.
Company Obligations Pursuant to the License Agreement

Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement and the License Agreement, the Company assumes the following obligations:
 
Royalties
 
The Company shall pay Magnus royalties (“Royalties”) equal to 6% (the “Royalty Rate”) of the gross amount invoiced by the Company for sales of Licensed Products, less, without duplication, the sum of the following: (a) reasonable discounts, rebates, allowances or price adjustments actually granted; (b) sales, value added, use, consumption, excise and/or similar taxes actually incurred; and (c) amounts refunded, credited or allowed on returns for, or rejections of, Licensed Products (“Net Sales”) of all Licensed Products sold, licensed, leased or otherwise disposed of (any of the foregoing, a “Sale”) by or on behalf of Magnus.

Term of the License Agreement

The term of the License Agreement commenced on September 29, 2016 (the “Effective Date”) and shall continue until the expiration of the last-to-expire of the Licensed Patents. 
 
If the Company materially breaches the License Agreement and does not cure such breach, to the extent capable of being cured, within twenty-one (21) days after receipt of written notice (the “Breach Notice”) from Licensor, then the License Agreement may be terminated upon written notice to that effect (the “Termination Notice”) from Licensor at any time after the expiration of twenty-one (21) days following receipt by Licensee of the Breach Notice. 
Fair Market Value of Patents; Board Approval
 
The Company engaged a third-party valuation firm to provide a fair market value of the Siemens Patents acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and related License Agreement in accordance with ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements. Management and the Company’s Board of Directors have relied on the fair market value provided by the third-party valuation firm in approving the Purchase Agreement transactions. The Board of Directors approved the Purchase Agreement and related transactions on December 15, 2016 in accordance with the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Management believes the primary value of the transaction is reflected in the patent portfolio acquired.


The Augmented Market Approach (“AMA”) was used to determine the fair market value of the Seimens Patents. AMA was developed from actual data of patent market transactions.
