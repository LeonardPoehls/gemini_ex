Company Overview
We develop, manufacture, market, and sell innovative medical devices for the treatment of aortic disorders. Our products are intended for the minimally invasive endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms ("AAA"). Our AAA products are built on one of two platforms: 

• | Traditional minimally-invasive endovascular aneurysm repair (“EVAR”) or


• | Endovascular aneurysm sealing (“EVAS”), our innovative solution for sealing the aneurysm sac while maintaining blood flow through two blood flow lumens.

Our current EVAR products include the AFX® Endovascular AAA System (the “AFX System”), the VELA® Proximal Endograft (“VELA”), and the Ovation® Abdominal Stent Graft System (the “Ovation System”). Our current EVAS product is the Nellix® Endovascular Aneurysm Sealing System (the “Nellix EVAS System”). We sell our EVAR platforms (including extensions and accessories) to hospitals in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, South Korea and Europe, and our EVAS platform to hospitals in New Zealand and Europe. We sell our EVAR and EVAS platforms (including extensions and accessories) to third-party international distributors and agents in Asia, Europe, South America and in other parts of the world. Such sales of our EVAR and EVAS platforms provide the sole source of our reported revenue.
Endologix®, AFX®, Nellix®, IntuiTrak®, Ovation®, VELA®, Ovation Prime®, Duraply®, Ovation Alto®, and CustomSeal®, are registered trademarks of Endologix, Inc. and its subsidiaries. ActiveSeal™ and the respective product logos are trademarks of Endologix, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
We have obtained CE Mark approval for the Nellix EVAS System in the European Union. The Nellix EVAS System is only approved as an investigational device in the United States. Ovation Alto, our next generation Ovation System device, is only approved as an investigational device and is not currently approved in any market.
Our Mission
Our mission is to be the leading innovator of medical devices to treat aortic disorders. The key elements of our strategy to accomplish this mission are as follows:

• | Focus exclusively on the aorta for the commercialization of innovative products.


• | Design and manufacture EVAR and EVAS products that are easy to use and deliver excellent clinical outcomes.


• | Design EVAR and EVAS products to expand into the treatment of complex AAA and thoracic anatomies.


• | Offer physicians and hospitals a broad range of products so they can provide the best device for each individual patient.


• | Provide exceptional clinical and technical support to physicians through an experienced and knowledgeable sales and clinical organization.

Market Overview and Opportunity
AAA Background 
Atherosclerosis reduces the integrity and strength of blood vessel walls, causing the blood vessel to expand or balloon out, which is known as an “aneurysm”. Aneurysms are commonly diagnosed in the aorta, which is the body’s largest artery, extending from the chest to the abdomen. The abdominal aorta is the segment between the renal (kidney) arteries and the area where the aorta divides into the two iliac arteries which travel down the legs. An abdominal aortic aneurysm (“AAA”) occurs when a portion of the abdominal aorta bulges into an aneurysm because of a weakening of the vessel wall, which may result in life threatening internal bleeding upon rupture. AAA is more common in men than women. 
Although AAA is one of the most serious cardiovascular diseases, many AAAs are never detected. Most AAA patients do not have symptoms at the time of their initial diagnosis. AAAs generally are discovered coincidentally during procedures to treat or diagnose unrelated medical conditions.
According to a paper titled Elective Versus Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair: A 1-Year Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, the overall patient mortality rate for ruptured AAA is approximately 80%, making it among the leading causes of 
2

death in the United States. Once diagnosed, patients with AAA require either non-invasive monitoring, or, depending on the size and rate of growth of the AAA, EVAR, EVAS or open surgical repair.
 EVAR and EVAS Versus Open Surgical Repair
Our EVAR and EVAS products are used exclusively for minimally-invasive procedures, as opposed to open surgical repair of AAA. Open surgical repair is a highly invasive procedure requiring (i) a large incision in the patient’s abdomen, (ii) manipulation of the patient’s abdominal organs to gain access to the aneurysm, (iii) the cross clamping of the aorta to stop blood flow, and (iv) implantation of a synthetic graft which is sutured to the aorta, connecting one end above the aneurysm, to the other end below the aneurysm. 
Open surgical repair typically lasts for two to four hours, while the typical EVAR and EVAS procedure lasts for one to two hours. After receiving open surgical repair, a patient usually requires a few days in the hospital’s surgical intensive care unit, and the total hospital stay may be four to ten days. Post-procedure convalescence may take another four to six weeks due to the invasiveness of the operation. By comparison, patients are often discharged a day or two after their EVAR and EVAS procedure, and once discharged, most patients return to normal activity within two weeks.
We estimate that approximately 75% of all treated AAAs in the United States are repaired through EVAR, and 25% through open surgical repair. Although EVAR and EVAS have many advantages over open surgical repair, many patients are not candidates for EVAR and EVAS due to the limitations of current EVAR devices to treat more complex AAA anatomies. We are developing new products to address these more challenging anatomies.
 Market Size
We estimate the global endovascular aortic aneurysm market potential to be $4.0 billion annually. Of this amount, we estimate the traditional aneurysm market potential, encompassing aneurysms with aortic neck length greater than or equal to 10mm, to be $1.6 billion. The majority of diagnosed aneurysms in this market can be treated with currently available EVAR products. We estimate that a $1.2 billion market opportunity exists for the treatment of challenging anatomies, defined as aneurysms with neck lengths less than 10mm. Currently, there are limited options with available EVAR products to treat these short or no neck aortic aneurysms. The thoracic aneurysm market includes aneurysms, dissections, and transections in the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and the descending aorta. For many of these anatomies there are limited endovascular options due to anatomical and technological challenges. We believe the thoracic market potential is $1.2 billion. Below is a table summarizing the market potential and penetration by aneurysm type. 

Market Description ($ in millions) | Penetrated | Unpenetrated | Total
Traditional | $ | 1,337 | | $ | 306 | $ | 1,643
Complex | 373 | | 803 | | 1,176
Thoracic | 589 | | 606 | | 1,195
Total | $ | 2,299 | | $ | 1,715 | $ | 4,014

We estimate that there are approximately 202,300 AAA (EVAR and surgical repair) procedures performed across the globe annually.
In the United States alone, an estimated 1.2 million to 2.0 million people have an AAA and over 200,000 people are diagnosed with an AAA in the United States annually. Of those diagnosed with an AAA, approximately 60,000 people underwent an AAA repair procedure in the United States in 2017, of which approximately 46,000 were addressed through EVAR.
According to United States Census Bureau estimates, the age 65 and over population in the United States presently numbers approximately 51 million, or 16% of the total population, and is expected to grow by 3.4% annually to 56 million by 2020. Accordingly, we believe that AAA treatments will naturally increase over time, given this demographic trend.
 Since AAAs generally arise in people over the age of 65 and come with little warning, initiatives have been undertaken to increase screening. The most prominent of these initiatives is the Screening Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Very Efficiently Act (“SAAAVE”), which was signed into law in the United States on February 8, 2006, began providing coverage on January 1, 2007 and was updated effective January 1, 2014. SAAAVE provides for a one-time free AAA screening for men who have smoked some time in their life, and men or women who have a family history of the disease.

Our Products
 Our EVAR Platforms
AFX System and VELA:
The AFX System consists of (i) a cobalt chromium alloy stent covered by expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (commonly referred to as ePTFE) graft material and (ii) accompanying delivery systems. Once fixed in its proper position within the abdominal aortic bifurcation, the AFX System provides a conduit for blood flow, thereby relieving pressure within the weakened or “aneurysmal” section of the vessel wall, which greatly reduces the potential for the AAA to rupture. In February 2014, we launched a new proximal extension in the United States, VELA, designed to be used in conjunction with our AFX bifurcated device. VELA features a circumferential graft line marker and controlled delivery system that enable predictable deployment and final positional adjustments. We began a commercial introduction of VELA in Europe in January 2015.

• | Anatomical Fixation. The AFX System is unique in that the main body of the device sits on the patient's natural aortoiliac bifurcation. This provides a solid foundation for the long-term stability of the device. Alternative EVAR devices rely on hooks, barbs and radial force to anchor within the aorta (commonly referred to as "proximal fixation") near the renal arteries. The data from our clinical studies have demonstrated anatomical fixation can inhibit device migration within the aorta due to the inherent foundational support of the patient’s own anatomy. 


• | Minimally Invasive Delivery System. The AFX System requires 17F introducer access on the ipsilateral side and 7F introducer access on the contralateral side. Comparative endovascular stent grafts for infrarenal repair require between 12F and 22F introducer access on the ipsilateral side and between 10F and 16F introducer access on the contralateral side.


• | Preserves Aortic Bifurcation. The AFX System allows for future endovascular procedures when access across the aortic bifurcation is required. Approximately 30% to 40% of AAA patients also have peripheral arterial disease (“PAD”). The AFX System is the only graft presently available that preserves the physician's ability to go back over the aortic bifurcation for future interventions. This is a meaningful feature of the AFX System, as many AAA patients today are living longer and returning to the hospital for PAD procedures.

Ovation System:
The Ovation System consists of (i) a radiopaque nitinol suprarenal stent with integral anchors, (ii) a low-permeability polytetrafluoroethylene (“PTFE”), aortic body graft that contains a network of inflatable rings filled with a liquid polymer that solidifies during the deployment procedure, (iii) nitinol iliac limb stents encapsulated with PTFE, and (iv) accompanying ultra-low profile delivery systems, auto injector and fill polymer kit. The Ovation System creates a custom seal that conforms to anatomical irregularities and has a low profile delivery system allowing for percutaneous access.

• | Patient Accessibility. Our FDA and CE Mark-approved Instructions for Use (“IFU”) allow for the on-label treatment of more patients who otherwise may undergo an off-label EVAR procedure or be subject to open surgical repair, or not receive treatment at all. Our differentiated platform expands the pool of patients eligible for EVAR by virtue of its low profile and flexible delivery system that addresses several key anatomical access challenges, while providing a novel sealing mechanism to address many of the difficulties of diseased patient anatomies.


• | Ability to Pass through Small Access Vessels. The Ovation System’s novel separation and optimization of fixation and seal minimize the overlap between metal and fabric within the catheter, allowing the device to be loaded in a delivery catheter that is smaller than those of conventional EVAR devices. At an outer diameter of 14F, or approximately 4.7mm, the Ovation System is the lowest profile FDA-approved stent graft.


• | Ability to Pass through Diseased and/or Tortuous Access Vessels. The Ovation System has the lowest profile FDA-approved delivery system. Its characteristics increase flexibility, designed to enable easier passage through access vessels.


• | The Ovation System Enables Minimally Invasive Techniques. The Ovation System’s low profile and proven safety record offer physicians the opportunity to provide percutaneous endovascular aneurysm repair access (“PEVAR”) with regional or local anesthesia to more patients. Studies have shown that the use of smaller profile delivery devices results in fewer access site complications.

• | Treatment of Complex Anatomy. The separation and optimization of the fixation and sealing mechanisms of the Ovation System enable the device to seal with a smaller aortic contact area than conventional EVAR devices.


• | Avoiding Aortic Neck Dilatation. The Ovation System’s polymer filled sealing rings do not exert significant chronic, outward pressure at the` neck of the aorta. In the Ovation Pivotal Trial, core lab results demonstrated stable neck diameter and durable seal with the Ovation System through five-year follow-up.

Our EVAS Platform
Nellix EVAS System:
Our Nellix EVAS System is designed to seal the aneurysm and provide blood flow to the legs through two blood flow lumens. The Nellix EVAS System consists of (i) bilateral covered stents with endobags, (ii) a biocompatible polymer injected into the endobags to seal the aneurysm and (iii) a delivery system and associated accessories. The Nellix EVAS System is intended to seal the entire aneurysm sac effectively excluding the aneurysm and reducing the likelihood of future aneurysm rupture.

• | Potentially Reduce Endoleaks Leading to Secondary Interventions. The Nellix EVAS System seals the entire aneurysm, potentially reducing the likelihood of many causes of secondary intervention in EVAR procedures.


• | Low Profile Introducer. The delivery catheter for the Nellix EVAS System has an outer diameter of 17F, which is beneficial for the delivery of the devices in tight access arteries, potentially reducing risk of vascular injuries to the patient.

Our EVAR and EVAS Extensions and Accessories
Aortic Extensions and Limb Extensions. We offer limb extensions for the Ovation System and proximal aortic extensions and limb extensions for the AFX System which allow physicians to customize the implant to fit the patient's anatomy. In February 2014, we launched a proximal extension in the United States, VELA, designed specifically for the treatment of proximal aortic neck anatomies with AFX. VELA features a circumferential graft line marker and controlled delivery system that enable predictable deployment and final positional adjustments. We commenced commercial sales of VELA in 2015. 
Accessories. We offer various accessories to facilitate the delivery of our EVAR and EVAS products, including compatible guidewires, inflation devices and snares. 
Our Product Evolution
 We first commercialized the Powerlink System (the "Powerlink System for AAA") in Europe in 1999 and in the United States in 2004. As our EVAR platform products evolved, we branded them under the names Powerlink System with Visiflex Delivery System, IntuiTrak®, and AFX. We added the Nellix EVAS System through our merger with Nellix, Inc. in December 2010. We added the Ovation System to our EVAR product portfolio through our merger with TriVascular in February 2016.

•Powerlink System for AAA. The Powerlink System for AAA was our original EVAR product. 

• | IntuiTrak. We received FDA approval for IntuiTrak in October 2008, CE Mark approval for IntuiTrak in March 2010, and Japanese Shonin approval for IntuiTrak in December 2012. IntuiTrak provided an updated delivery system that enhanced physician ease of use and for manufacturability.


• | AFX. In May 2011 and November 2011, we received FDA approval and CE Mark approval, respectively, for the AFX System, and we received Japanese Shonin approval for the AFX System in December 2015. We began a full commercial launch of the AFX System in the United States in August 2011 and in numerous international markets in 2012. In addition, we entered into a distribution arrangement with a Japanese distributor to introduce the AFX System in the Japanese market in the first quarter of 2016.


• | AFX2. In October 2015, we received FDA approval for our AFX2 Bifurcated Endograft System (“AFX2”).


• | Ovation TriVascular. We received CE mark approval for the Ovation System in August 2010 and FDA approval for the Ovation System in October 2012. In February 2015, the FDA approved our next generation Ovation iX Iliac Stent Graft for the Ovation System, and in July 2015, the FDA approved the Ovation

5

iX Abdominal Stent Graft System.  In September 2015, the first patients were treated with the Ovation iX Abdominal Stent Graft System in Europe, and in October 2015, we initiated the launch of our Ovation iX Iliac Stent Graft System in the United States.

• | Nellix EVAS System. In February 2013, we received CE Mark approval of the Nellix EVAS System, and we commenced a limited market introduction of the Nellix EVAS System in Europe. In December 2013, we received IDE approval in the United States to begin a clinical trial which commenced in January 2014. Enrollment in the IDE study was completed in November 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we obtained IDE continued access approval for additional patients. In April 2016, we announced achievement of CE Mark approval of the next-generation Nellix EVAS System. In September 2017, we announced CE Mark approval for the Nellix EVAS System with the refined IFU. In October 2017, we received IDE approval in the United States to begin the EVAS2 confirmatory clinical study to evaluate the next-generation Nellix EVAS System.


• | ChEVAS. ChEVAS is a procedure where the Nellix EVAS System could potentially be used together with branch stent grafts to treat patients with complex aortic anatomies. Physicians initiated a clinical trial called ASCEND (Aneurysm Study for Complex AAA: Evaluation of Nellix Durability) to evaluate the clinical performance of ChEVAS. We are pursuing CE mark and FDA approval for this indication.

Product Developments and Clinical Trials
Overview
We incurred expenses of $34.0 million in 2017, $48.6 million in 2016, and $41.8 million in 2015, on research and development activities and clinical studies. Our focus is to continually develop innovative and cost-effective medical devices for the treatment of aortic disorders. We believe that our ability to develop new technologies is a key to our future growth and success. Historically, we have focused on developing our EVAR and EVAS products to treat infrarenal AAA, including initial development of products to treat complex AAA anatomies. However, we expect to devote more resources in the future to developing, enhancing and obtaining expanded indications for our current EVAR and EVAS products and to develop new product indications to treat more complex anatomies. 
Nellix EVAS System
Using the technology we acquired in the Nellix acquisition, we developed the Nellix EVAS System, a next-generation device, to treat infrarenal AAA. We have the following trials in process to build independent and collective clinical and economic evidence of clinical safety and effectiveness:

• | EVAS FORWARD IDE - We conducted this pivotal clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Nellix EVAS System. This study is a prospective single arm registry which enrolled 179 patients at 29 centers in the United States and Europe. In November 2014, we completed enrollment in the study, and we submitted the one year results to the FDA in March 2016. In May 2016, we announced the results of the one year clinical data from the EVAS FORWARD IDE study that demonstrate that the Nellix EVAS System met the study primary endpoints for major adverse events at 30 days (safety) and treatment success at one year (effectiveness). Two-year imaging revealed a signal of migration, leading to a field safety notification issued in October 2016 and a dedicated root cause analysis, resulting in refinements to the IFU. Following the implementation of the refined IFU, the Nellix EVAS system is applicable to treat an estimated 40% of AAA patients with a traditional aneurysm.

Subsequently, the two-year results from the trial were announced. Key highlights from the Nellix US IDE trial two-year clinical data are included below:

• | Freedom from all endoleaks (94%), rupture (97%), all-cause mortality (97%), and cardiovascular mortality (99%), among all patients.


• | Highest freedom of type II endoleaks, of 97%, ever reported at two years, among all patients.


• | When applying the refined IFUs for Nellix, patients at the two-year follow-up demonstrated 96% freedom from Type IA endoleak, migration >10mm, and sac growth.


• | EVAS2 IDE - In May 2017, we announced the decision to seek United States approval of the Nellix EVAS System by conducting a confirmatory clinical study with the updated IFU and the Gen2 device design. The Gen2 device incorporates design improvements to enhance ease of use and offers physicians more sizes to treat more patients with AAA. In October 2017, we announced our receipt of IDE approval from the FDA to commence a confirmatory clinical study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Gen2 Nellix EVAS System for the

6

endovascular treatment of infrarenal AAA. The EVAS2 IDE Multicenter Safety and Effectiveness Confirmatory Study (“EVAS2”) will prospectively evaluate the refined IFU and the Nellix Gen2 EVAS System. The study is approved to enroll up to 90 primary patients, with one-year follow-up data required for the pre-market approval (“PMA”) application. We commenced EVAS2 patient enrollment in March 2018, and currently estimate a decision on our PMA application by the end of 2020.

• | EVAS FORWARD Global Registry - This study is designed to provide real world clinical results to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the Nellix EVAS System. The first phase of the registry included 300 patients enrolled in up to 30 international centers. The first patient in the registry was treated in October 2013. In September 2014, we announced completion of patient enrollment in the EVAS FORWARD Global Registry. In November 2016, we announced positive two-year results on 300 patients from the EVAS FORWARD Global Registry at the annual VEITH meeting. The following outcomes were presented at the annual VEITH meeting:


• | 37% of the patients had complex anatomies;


• | 98% freedom from any persistent endoleaks at latest follow-up;


• | No secondary interventions for Type II endoleaks;


• | 97% freedom from aneurysm-related mortality; and


• | 99% freedom from cardiovascular mortality.

In 2017, the EVAS FORWARD Global Registry 2 commenced a post market evaluation of the Nellix Gen2 EVAS System, our second generation device design.

• | ASCEND Registry - In April 2016, we announced the first data presentation with one-year outcomes from the ASCEND Registry (Aneurysm Study for Complex AAA: Evaluation of Nellix Durability), a physician-initiated registry of the Nellix EVAS System used with aortic branch stent grafts for the treatment of patients with complex AAAs. The results of the study were formally published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Endovascular Therapy in December 2017.

Refined IFU - In September 2017, we announced CE Mark approval for the Nellix EVAS System with the refined IFU. The Nellix EVAS System is being studied in the U.S. under an IDE. Following a thorough review of supporting clinical data, the Company's Notified Body in the European Union, together with an independent clinical reviewer, has determined that the Nellix EVAS System, with the refined IFU, meets the applicable safety and clinical performance requirements. As a result of these evaluations, the Notified Body has granted a CE Mark for the Nellix EVAS System with the refined IFU.
AFX System
In September 2014, we announced a new clinical study called LEOPARD (Looking at EVAR Outcomes by Primary Analysis of Randomized Data). This study was designed to compare outcomes of the AFX System versus other commercially available EVAR devices. We designed the LEOPARD study to randomize and enroll up to 600 patients at 60 leading centers throughout the United States and commenced enrollment in the first quarter of 2015. The centers were a mix of our current and new customers, with each investigator selecting one competitive device to randomize against AFX. The LEOPARD study is being led by an independent steering committee of leading physicians who are involved with the study and responsible for presenting the results over the five-year follow-up period.
Subsequently, positive interim results from LEOPARD were announced. Based upon the patients that have completed their one-year follow-up, freedom from Aneurysm Related Complications with AFX/AFX2 is 84.7%, compared to 82.0% with other devices. These preliminary results demonstrate similar outcomes between the endografts under investigation. AFX/AFX2, however, remains the only device that preserves the patient's aortic bifurcation. Based upon the anticipated number of additional patients required to prove superiority, we stopped further randomization in the LEOPARD study and plan to continue to follow enrolled patients for the planned five years.
In December 2015, we announced that the AFX Endovascular AAA System for the treatment of AAA received Shonin approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (“MHLW”).
In February 2016, we announced the completion of the first United States commercial implant of AFX2, which reduces procedure steps for the delivery and deployment of the bifurcated endograft. AFX2 also facilitates PEVAR by providing the lowest profile contralateral access through a 7F introducer. These improvements bring together our ActiveSeal™ technology, DuraPly® PTFE graft material and VELA Proximal Endograft, into an integrated new EVAR system.
7

In December 2016, we received notice from our Notified Body in the European Union that the CE Mark for AFX and AFX2 would be suspended due to reports of Type III endoleaks with a prior generation of the device. We had, for our current generation of AFX products, implemented device and graft material improvements and updated IFUs resulting in a substantial reduction in reported Type III endoleaks. We provided documentation of the foregoing reduction in Type III endoleaks to our Notified Body. In January 2017, we received notice from our Notified Body that the CE Mark for AFX and AFX2 had been re-instated, effective immediately. 
Additionally, in December 2016, we placed a temporary hold on shipments of AFX and AFX2 to complete an investigation of quality concerns with some sizes of these devices. Subsequently, we removed the temporary hold and resumed shipments of all sizes of AFX and the smaller diameter sizes of AFX2 and initiated a voluntary recall of (1) the small remaining quantity of original AFX with Strata graft material, and (2) the larger diameter sizes of AFX2. In January 2017, we removed the temporary hold and resumed shipments of the remaining larger diameter sizes of AFX2.
Ovation System
In May 2011, we initiated a three-year European Post Market Registry to enroll 500 patients across 30 European centers. Enrollment ended in December 2013. In January 2017, we announced positive three-year results from the Ovation EU Post Market Registry. The data were presented at the 2017 LINC meeting and showed that the Ovation platform has the broadest range of patient applicability on IFU of all commercially available infrarenal endovascular AAA devices. The resulting outcomes included: 

• | 99% freedom from aneurysm-related mortality;


• | 99% freedom from migration, rupture, and conversion;


• | 97% freedom from Type I/III endoleak; and


• | Excellent freedom from secondary intervention for occlusion (97%), Type I endoleak (97%) and Type II endoleak 95%.

In October 2014, we initiated the LIFE Study to illustrate the potential advantages of a fast track protocol including PEVAR, no general anesthesia, no time in ICU and a one night stay in the hospital with the Ovation System. In May 2016, we announced the completion of enrollment of 250 patients at 34 sites participating in the LIFE Study. In September 2016, we announced the results of the one-month clinical data from the LIFE Study that demonstrate that the Ovation System met the study primary endpoint for major adverse events at 30 days. The following are highlights of the presentation, with outcomes covering one-month follow-up:

• | Low major adverse event rate of 0.4%;


• | No ruptures, conversion, or secondary interventions;


• | 99% and 100% freedom from type I and type III endoleaks, respectively;


• | Fast-Track completed in 216 (87%) patients, with positive results compared to non-Fast-Track patients;


• | Procedure time of 84 minutes vs. 110 minutes;


• | General anesthesia use 0% vs. 18%;


• | ICU stay 0% vs. 32%; and


• | Mean hospital stay 1.2 vs. 1.9 days.

In August 2015, we enrolled the first subject in the LUCY Study, a multi-center post-market registry designed to explore the clinical benefits associated with EVAR using the Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft Platform in female patients with AAA, as compared to males. It is the first prospective study evaluating EVAR in females, a population that has historically been underrepresented in EVAR clinical trials. We announced completion of enrollment of 225 patients in the LUCY study in February 2017. The 30-day LUCY data showed that, in women, the ultra-low profile (14F) Ovation System device resulted in: 

• | At least 28% greater EVAR eligibility for women with AAA;


• | 1.3% major adverse events, the lowest rate reported for EVAR, compared to other contemporary, prospective, post-market registries;


• | No deaths;


• | No proximal endoleaks;


• | No limb occlusion;


• | Low readmission rate of 3.9%; and

8


• | 100% procedural success

In February 2015, the FDA approved the next generation Ovation iX Iliac Stent Graft for the Ovation System, and in July 2015, the FDA approved the Ovation iX Abdominal Stent Graft System. In September 2015, the first patients were treated with the Ovation iX Abdominal Stent Graft System in Europe, and in August 2015, we initiated the launch of the Ovation iX System in the United States.
In November 2016, we announced at VEITH that the five-year results from the Ovation Global Pivotal Trial were positive and showed the following outcomes:

• | Broad patient applicability, with 40% of the patients treated outside the labeled indications of other EVAR devices;


• | Stable aortic neck diameters with an average expansion of 0.1%, compared to 25% as reported with other EVAR devices;


• | 97% freedom from secondary interventions related to type I endoleak; and


• | No migration or conversions.

In August 2016, we announced that the first two patients were treated with the Ovation Alto® Abdominal Stent Graft System, which is the newest device in the Ovation System platform of abdominal stent graft systems. Ovation Alto is an investigational device, currently not approved in any market. It expands EVAR to include the treatment of patients with complex AAAs, specifically patients with very short or otherwise complex aortic neck anatomy. This is achieved by the conformable O-rings with CustomSeal® polymer that have been repositioned near the top of the endograft, providing seal just below the renal arteries. In November 2016, we received IDE approval from the FDA to conduct a clinical study with the Ovation Alto® Abdominal Stent Graft System in the United States.
In March 2017, we announced the enrollment of the first patients in the Expanding Patient Applicability with Polymer Sealing Ovation Alto Stent Graft (“ELEVATE”) IDE clinical study, our pivotal clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Ovation Alto for the repair of infrarenal AAAs. The ELEVATE IDE clinical trial is approved to enroll 75 patients at up to 16 centers in the United States. 
The Company plans to file regulatory submissions in the third quarter of 2018 and estimates potential approval of the Alto device in both the U.S. and European markets in 2019.
PEVAR
Vascular access for EVAR previously required femoral artery exposure (commonly referred to as surgical cut-down) of one or both femoral arteries, allowing for safe introduction of the EVAR product. Complications from femoral artery exposure during EVAR procedures is an inherent risk of current surgical practice. PEVAR procedures do not require an open surgical cut-down of either femoral artery, as access to the femoral artery is achieved via a needle-puncture through the skin and closure with use of a suture-mediated device. Advantages to the patient and to the health care system of an entirely percutaneous procedure include reduced surgical procedure times, less post-operative pain, and fewer access-related wound complications.  
In April 2013, we announced FDA approval of the PEVAR indication for use with our AFX and IntuiTrak products. Trial results show the safety and effectiveness of our device and PEVAR procedure facilitated with a suture-mediated closure device, and showed reduced surgical procedure time compared to surgical EVAR. Other trends favoring PEVAR include less medication prescribed for post-operative groin pain, reduced blood loss, and less hospitalization time. To date, no other company has conducted a randomized prospective FDA trial to specifically obtain approval for a PEVAR indication. 
Manufacturing and Supply
Most of our commercial products are manufactured, assembled, and packaged at our 129,000 square foot leased facilities in Irvine, California and our 110,000 square foot leased facilities in Santa Rosa, California.
We rely on third parties for the supply of certain components used in our EVAR and EVAS products, such as the wire used to form our cobalt chromium alloy stent, PTFE and the raw material used in the manufacturing of polymer. While we obtain many of these components from single source suppliers, we believe there are alternative vendors for the supply of the vast majority of our required components. Many of our third party manufacturers go through a formal qualification and approval process, including periodic renewal to ensure fitness for use and compliance with applicable FDA requirements and International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 13485 requirements, and/or other required quality standards. Additionally, we actively manage supply risk with our key suppliers through a combination of negotiating favorable terms of supply agreements, maintaining strategic inventory levels, and maintaining frequent communications with our suppliers.

Marketing and Sales
We market and sell our EVAR products through a direct sales force and network of agents in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, South Korea, and fourteen European countries. In 20 other European countries, Japan, 12 Latin American countries, and seven other Asian countries we sell our EVAR products through independent distributors. In 2017, we marketed our EVAR products in 56 countries outside the United States. 
United States. We market and sell our EVAR products in the United States through a direct sales force. The primary customer and decision-maker for our EVAR products is the vascular surgeon, and to a lesser extent, the cardiovascular surgeon, interventional radiologist and the interventional cardiologist. Through our direct sales force, we provide clinical support and service to many of the approximately 1,600 hospitals and approximately 4,000 physicians in the United States that perform EVAR. Approximately 68% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were generated from sales of our EVAR products in the United States.
International. We market and sell our products outside the United States through a direct sales force and through third party distributors and agents. Approximately 32% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were generated from sales of our EVAR and EVAS products outside the United States.
 See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a tabular summary of our revenue by geographic region for the fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015. 
Competition
The medical device industry is highly competitive. Any product we develop that achieves regulatory clearance or approval will have to compete for market acceptance and market share. We believe that the primary competitive factors in the AAA device market segment are:

• | clinical effectiveness;


• | product safety, reliability, and durability;


• | ease of use;


• | sales force experience and relationships; and


• | price.

We experience significant competition and we expect that the intensity of competition will increase over time. For example, our major competitors, Medtronic, Inc., W.L. Gore Inc., and Cook Medical Products, Inc., have each obtained full regulatory approval for their EVAR products in the United States and/or other international markets. In addition to these major competitors, we also have smaller competitors, and emerging competitors with active EVAR system development programs.
Our major competitors have substantially greater capital resources than we do and also have greater resources in the areas of research and development, regulatory affairs, manufacturing, marketing, and sales. In addition, these competitors have multiple product offerings, which some physicians and hospitals may find more convenient when developing business relationships. We also compete with other medical device companies for clinical trial sites and for the hiring of qualified personnel, including sales representatives and clinical specialists.
Patents and Proprietary Information
We believe that our intellectual property and proprietary information is key to protecting our technology. We continue to build a portfolio of apparatus and method patents covering various aspects of our current and future technology. In the area of aorta treatment systems, our rights include 37 United States patents, 9 pending United States patent applications, 32 issued foreign patents and 9 pending foreign patent applications. Our current AFX-related aorta treatment related patents have expiration dates from 2018 to 2038. As a result of our acquisition of Nellix, we added additional patents to our portfolio which have evolved to currently include 22 issued United States patents, 26 pending United States patent applications, and 14 issued foreign patents, with expiration dates from 2018 to 2038. As a result of our merger with TriVascular, we added patents to our portfolio which have evolved to currently including 46 issued United States patents, 20 pending United States patent applications, and 87 issued foreign patents with expiration dates from 2018 to 2037. We intend to continue to file patent applications to strengthen our intellectual property position as we continue to develop our technology, while simultaneously avoiding paying unnecessary fees to maintain patents and applications when we believe it is not in our best interest.
10

 Our policy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing United States and foreign patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also own trademarks to protect our brand. In addition to patents and trademarks, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how protection as well.
 We seek protection of these trade secrets and proprietary know-how, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. We make diligent efforts to require our employees, directors, consultants, and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements at the beginning of their employment, consulting, or other contractual relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual or entity during the course of the relationship is to be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties, except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and certain other parties, the agreements also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual will be our exclusive property.
 Third-Party Reimbursement
In the United States, hospitals are the primary purchasers of our EVAR and EVAS products. Hospitals in turn bill various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance plans, for the total healthcare services required to treat the patient’s AAA. Government agencies, private insurers and other payors determine whether to provide coverage for a particular procedure and to reimburse hospitals for medical treatment. While hospitals are often reimbursed at a fixed rate based on the diagnosis-related group (“DRG”) established by the United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service (“CMS”), other insurers may negotiate differing approaches with hospitals. The fixed rate of reimbursement is based on the procedure performed, and is unrelated to the specific medical devices used in that procedure.
Reimbursement of procedures utilizing our EVAR and EVAS products currently are covered. Some payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that the device used in a treatment was unnecessary, not cost-effective, or used for a non-approved indication.
Beginning on October 1, 2015, CMS started requiring those who make claims for reimbursement to use ICD-10 codes to designate diagnosis and treatment of Medicare beneficiaries. The following are the ICD-10-PCS codes associated with the endovascular treatment of abdominal aneurysms utilizing our devices indicated for that treatment. 

ICD-10 PCS | Description 
Abdominal Aorta
04V03DZ | Restriction of Abdominal Aorta, with Intraluminal Device, Percutaneous Approach 
04V04DZ | Restriction of Abdominal Aorta, with Intraluminal Device, Percutaneous Endoscopic Approach 
04V03DJ | Restriction of Abdominal Aorta, with Intraluminal Device, Temporary, Percutaneous Approach 
04V04DJ | Restriction of Abdominal Aorta, with Intraluminal Device, Temporary, Percutaneous Endoscopic Approach 
04U03JZ | Supplement of Abdominal Aorta with Synthetic Substitute, Percutaneous Approach 
04U04JZ | Supplement of Abdominal Aorta with Synthetic Substitute, Percutaneous Endoscopic Approach 

CMS reimburses these hospital inpatient procedures utilizing the following MS-DRGs. National average reimbursement values are shown.

Aortic and Heart Assist Procedures Except Pulsation Balloon with MCC | $37,598
Aortic and Heart Assist Procedures Except Pulsation Balloon without MCC | $24,017

Outside of the United States, market acceptance of medical devices, including EVAR and EVAS systems, depends partly upon the availability of reimbursement within the prevailing healthcare payment system. Reimbursement levels vary significantly by country, and by region within some countries. Reimbursement is obtained from a variety of sources, including government sponsored healthcare and private health insurance plans.
Presently, the European Union (“EU”) is updating regulations for the sale and reimbursement of medical devices in EU countries. The current directives on active implantable medical devices (90/385/EEC) and on medical devices (93/42/EEC) will 
11

be replaced by a regulation on medical devices. The legislation will harmonize such regulations throughout all EU countries. It is expected that the new regulations will require: (i) stricter guidelines for clinical evidence supporting device efficacy, (ii) more powers for regulatory assessment bodies, (iii) stronger supervision of manufacturers, importers and distributors, and (iv) an extended database for medical devices and better traceability throughout the supply chain. The European Commission proposals have been discussed in the European Parliament and in the European Council, and a final text was agreed upon on June 15, 2016. Work is currently ongoing to translate the final texts in all the EU official languages and to correct technical inconsistencies. Final formal adoption was expected both on the Council and the Parliament sides during the first semester 2017. Regulation would then gradually come into effect by 2020. 
 Government Regulation - Medical Devices
 Our medical devices are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the FDA and similar agencies within governments outside the United States. Each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, qualification, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and distribution of our medical devices.
 United States
 In the United States, medical devices are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes based upon controls the FDA considers necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are subject to general controls such as labeling, adherence to good manufacturing practices and maintenance of product complaint records, but are usually exempt from premarket notification requirements. Class II devices are subject to the same general controls and also are subject to special controls such as performance standards, FDA guidelines, and may also require clinical testing prior to approval. Class III devices are subject to the highest level of controls because they are life-sustaining or life-supporting devices. Class III devices require rigorous clinical testing prior to their approval and generally require a PMA or PMA supplement approval prior to marketing for sale.
Authorization to commercially distribute a medical device in the United States is generally received in one of two ways. The first, known as premarket notification (i.e., the 510(k) process), requires us to submit data to the United States FDA to demonstrate that our medical device is substantially equivalent to another medical device that is legally marketed in the United States The United States FDA must issue a finding of substantial equivalence before we can commercially distribute our medical device. Devices that receive a finding of substantial equivalence are referred to as 510(k)-cleared devices. Modifications to medical devices cleared under the 510(k) process can be made under the 510(k) process, or without the 510(k) process if the changes do not significantly affect safety or effectiveness. 
The second process, known as premarket approval (i.e., the PMA process), requires us to collect and submit nonclinical and human clinical data on the medical device for its intended use to demonstrate that it is safe and effective. Human clinical data must be collected in compliance with FDA IDE regulations. The IDE application must be supported by data, typically including the results of animal and engineering testing of the device. If the IDE application is approved by the FDA, human clinical studies may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a maximum number of patients. The clinical studies must be conducted under the review of an independent institutional review board to ensure the protection of the patients’ rights. In the PMA process, the FDA will approve the medical device and thereby authorize its commercial distribution in the United States if it determines that the probable benefits outweigh the risks for the intended patient population, and, therefore, makes a determination of reasonable assurances of safety and effectiveness. The PMA process takes longer and is more expensive than the 510(k) process. Our Powerlink, IntuiTrak AFX, AFX2 and Ovation EVAR Systems were approved through this PMA process. The Nellix EVAS System is currently engaged in the PMA process and we anticipate will be made commercially available in the United States following PMA approval.
We are required to register as a medical device manufacturer with the FDA. Additionally, the California Department of Health Services (“CDHS”) requires us to register as a medical device manufacturer. Because of this, the FDA and the CDHS routinely inspect us for compliance with Quality System regulations. These regulations require that we manufacture our products and maintain related documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and control activities. We have undergone and expect to continue to undergo regular Quality System inspections in connection with the manufacture of our products at our facility. Further, the FDA requires us to comply with various regulations regarding labeling. The Medical Device Reporting (“MDR”) laws and regulations require us to provide information to the FDA on deaths or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of our devices, as well as product malfunctions that likely would cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. Although physicians are permitted to use their medical judgment to apply medical devices to indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA, we are prohibited from promoting products for such “off-label” uses, and can only market our products for the 510(k)-cleared or PMA-approved indications for use.
12

International
Internationally, our medical devices are subject to regulatory requirements in the countries in which they are sold. The requirements and regulatory approval processes vary from country to country. 
In the EU, one regulatory approval process exists. We must comply with the requirements of the Medical Devices Directive (“MDD”), and appropriately affix the CE Mark on our products to attest to such compliance. To obtain a CE Mark, our products must meet minimum standards of safety, performance, and quality (i.e., “Essential Requirements”), and then comply with defined conformity assessment routes. A notified body, selected by us, assesses our Quality Management System and our product conformity to the Essential Requirements and the requirements of the MDD. The notified body must perform regular inspections to verify compliance. The EU government ministries of health ("Competent Authorities") oversee human clinical studies and post-market surveillance of approved products, referred to as Vigilance Reporting. We are required to report device failures and serious adverse events potentially related to product use to responsible Competent Authorities. We also must comply with additional requirements of individual countries in which our products are marketed. Our Powerlink, AFX, and Ovation EVAR Systems and Nellix EVAS System were approved through the CE marking process.
To be sold in Japan, most medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before they are granted approval, or “Shonin”. In Japan, the MHLW, with administration by the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency, regulates medical devices under the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Law (“PMD”). Our quality management system and product conformity to the PMD are overseen by MHLW and Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency. Our Powerlink System and AFX System were approved through the Shonin process. The Ovation System and the Nellix EVAS System require future approval through the foregoing process in order to be commercially available in Japan.
 To be sold in China, all medical devices are required to have licenses from the China Food and Drug Administration (“CFDA”) (formerly State Food & Drug Administration or SFDA). Quality system, premarket testing and clinical investigation are required for Class II and III devices. CFDA released a new regulation on Innovative Medical Device Registration Applications in March 2014, which Endologix may utilize to register its product in China. Class II and III submissions will have a full application review conducted; this will include a technical and administrative review. Novel and high-risk products may also be subject to an Expert Panel Meeting (which may result in an additional 4 to 6 months to the review process), and CFDA may conduct an onsite QMS audit of manufacturing facilities. The AFX System and the Ovation System, as well as the Nellix EVAS System, require future approval through the foregoing process in order to be commercially available in China.
We are also subject to other local, state, federal and international regulations relating to a variety of areas including laboratory practices, manufacturing practices, medical device export, quality system practices, as well as health care reimbursement and delivery of products and services.
 United States and Foreign Government Regulations - Healthcare Fraud and Abuse and Privacy Laws
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse
We are subject to various United States and foreign governmental laws and regulations relating to the manufacturing, labeling, marketing and selling of our products, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have implemented and maintain a comprehensive compliance program that includes ongoing risk assessment, development of relevant policies, monitoring, and training of our employees to ensure compliance with United States and foreign laws and regulations. 
 Various United States federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse govern how we can and cannot do business in the United States and globally, including the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally-funded health care program, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits offers to pay or receive remuneration of any kind for the purpose of inducing or rewarding referrals of items or services reimbursable by a Federal health care program, and similar state false claims and anti-kickback laws and regulations that apply to state funded health care programs. Violations of these laws and regulations are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the United States, exclusion from participation in federal and/or state health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. The interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid change. 
 We conduct a significant amount of sales activity outside of the United States. We intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities internationally, including in emerging markets. Our international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a complex set of laws and regulations, including:
13


• | Foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs;


• | Complex data privacy requirements and laws;


• | Ever-changing and contradictory country-specific guidelines, transparency requirements and laws;


• | The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a United States law, which prosecutes United States companies who engage in bribery when doing business with physicians, distributors, agents, and other third parties outside the United States Many physicians outside the United States are considered government officials, and United States companies, together with individuals who engaged in the bribery, face civil and criminal sanctions both in the United States and any country where bribery of a government official violates the law of that country;


• | Foreign anti-corruption laws, such as the UK Bribery Act; and


• | Trade protection measures, including import or export restrictions or sanctions, that may restrict us from doing business in and/or shipping products to certain parts of the world.

The foregoing are subject to change and evolving interpretations and any violation thereof could subject us to financial or other penalties. 
US and Foreign Privacy Laws
We are subject to various United States federal and state privacy and security laws and regulations that protect the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information. We are mindful that our systems require significant resources and oversight to protect employee, patient, physician and customer information. If we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians, and other health care professionals, have regulatory sanctions or other penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach, or suffer other adverse consequences.
We are also impacted by the privacy and security requirements of countries outside the United States Privacy standards in Europe and Asia have become stricter. Enforcement actions and financial penalties related to privacy in the EU are growing, and foreign governmental authorities have passed new laws and restrictions relating to privacy requirements and standards. The management of cross border transfers of information among and outside of EU member countries is becoming more complex, which may affect our consulting arrangements with physicians or our clinical research activities, as well as product offerings that involve transmission or use of clinical data.
The EU published the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in April 2016. This major piece of legislation represents the most significant change in EU data protection law since 1995. It will apply in all EU Member States as of May 2018. The GDPR mandates a baseline set of standards that will have a significant impact on us as we are involved in the processing of personal data outside the EU. It will increase the penalties for noncompliance, with fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual worldwide revenue. 
Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, corruption, or destruction of our systems or information could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Thus, we will continue our efforts to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and regulations. To the best of our knowledge at this time, we do not expect that the ongoing cost and impact of assuring compliance with applicable privacy and security laws and regulations will have a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Product Liability
The manufacture and marketing of medical devices carries the significant risk of financial exposure to product liability claims. Our products are used in situations in which there is a high risk of serious injury or death. Such risks will exist even with respect to those products that have received, or in the future may receive, regulatory approval for commercial sale. We are currently covered under a product liability insurance policy with coverage limits of $20 million per occurrence and $20 million per year in the aggregate, subject to customary deductible of $150,000. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 675 employees (as compared to 782 employees as of December 31, 2016), including 218 in manufacturing, 45 in research and development, 41 in regulatory and clinical affairs, 75 in quality, 191 in sales and marketing, and 105 in administration. We believe that the success of our business will depend on our ability to attract and retain 
14

qualified personnel. Our employees are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that we have good relations with our employees.
