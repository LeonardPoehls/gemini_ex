Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company engaged in the development of biosimilar and therapeutic equivalent products and other high-value and difficult-to-manufacture proteins. We leverage our protein production platform, Pfēnex Expression Technology®, to produce complex proteins with higher accuracy and greater degree of protein purity, as well as speed and cost advantages. We use this technology to produce biosimilar candidates, therapeutic equivalent product candidates, as well as vaccine candidates. It is our goal to leverage our patented technology and our teams expertise in bioanalytical characterization to become a leading protein therapeutics company. 
 We are currently focused on several product candidates, however our two lead candidates are PF708, a therapeutic equivalent candidate to Forteo®, and PF582, a biosimilar candidate to Lucentis®. 
 Product Candidates 
 The following table summarizes certain information about our lead product candidates: 
 

Product Candidate | BrandedReferenceDrug | CollaborationPartner | Indication 
Biosimilars and Therapeutic Equivalents | | | 
PF708  Teriparatide | Forteo | Wholly-Owned | Osteoporosis 
PF582  Ranibizumab | Lucentis | Wholly-Owned | Macular edema or choroidal neovascularization conditions
Novel Vaccines | | | 
Px563L  rPA based anthrax vaccine | N/A | U.S. Government Funded | Anthrax post-exposure prophylaxis 

PF708  Forteo 
 PF708 is a product candidate that is being developed as a therapeutic equivalent to Forteo (teriparatide), marketed by Eli Lilly for the treatment of osteoporosis patients at high risk of fracture. Forteo achieved approximately $1.4 billion in global product sales in 2015. The PF708 bioequivalence study, conducted in 70 healthy subjects, was completed in the second quarter of 2016 and met its primary objectives. The 90% confidence intervals of the area-under-the-curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) geometric mean ratios of PF708 versus Forteo were within the 80-125% range required for concluding bioequivalence. We initiated an immunogenicity/pharmacokinetics clinical study in osteoporosis patients in the fourth quarter of 2016. We believe that this study, along with the positive bioequivalence study, should satisfy the filing requirements for PF708 through the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. The interim pharmacokinetic data from this study is expected in the second half of 2017 and the immunogenicity data is expected in the first half of 2018. We believe that the clinical program in the United States may be leveraged for regulatory filings in other geographies, such as the European Union. 
PF582  Ranibizumab 
 PF582 is a biosimilar product candidate to Lucentis (ranibizumab), indicated for the treatment of visual impairment due to neovascular, or wet, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), macular edema following retinal vein occlusion, choroidal neovascularization secondary to pathologic myopia, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetic macular edema.

We have completed extensive bioanalytical similarity studies comparing PF582 to multiple lots of United States and European Union sourced Lucentis, as well as comparability studies between multiple lots of PF582 at the pilot scale and commercial scale. Based on our analytical and preclinical data package, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted us a Biosimilar Initial Advisory Meeting which was held in January 2014. We discussed the data that was generated prior to that date, our comparative clinical trial design and our strategy for the comparison of European Union and the United States licensed reference products. In the subsequent meeting minutes, the FDA indicated that our analytical data appear acceptable to support the development of PF582 as a biosimilar candidate to Lucentis. Similarly, we have had discussions with the European Unions Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, and Health Canada. 
 In the third quarter of 2016, we announced top-line results from the Phase 1/2 trial, which showed that PF582 was pharmacologically active and with a safety profile that was consistent with that of Lucentis. We enrolled a total of 25 VEGF-inhibitor naïve patients with neovascular AMD in the PF582 Phase 1/2 trial (13 received PF582, including one sentinel patient who received open label PF582, 12 received Lucentis). All patients received three monthly intravitreal injections. The primary endpoint of the study was safety and tolerability of PF582 compared to that of Lucentis. There were no clinically meaningful differences in adverse event profiles or intra-ocular pressure between PF582 and Lucentis. The efficacy and pharmacodynamic results indicated that there were no clinically meaningful differences in best corrected visual acuity or decreases in central retinal thickness between PF582 and Lucentis at any of the timepoints. 
 Vaccine Programs 
 Our Pfēnex Expression Technology® is also well suited for vaccine development. We are developing Px563L, a novel anthrax vaccine candidate, in response to the United States governments unmet demand for increased quantity, stability and dose sparing regimens of anthrax vaccine. We initiated a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1a trial in healthy subjects in the second half of 2015 to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of Px563L, and we announced the interim analysis results in the second half of 2016. Findings indicated that the vaccine was well-tolerated, with the potential to afford immunogenicity protection against anthrax infection after only two injections (vs. three for the currently licensed anthrax vaccine product). 
 The development of Px563L is funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, in accordance with a cost plus fixed fee advanced development contract valued at up to approximately $143.5 million. In addition to the base period, BARDA has now exercised additional phases of the development contract effective January 2017, allowing for the continuing development of Px563L. The phase 2 study could initiate in 2018, provided the program continues to successfully advance with the support of BARDA. 
 The development of Px533, a prophylactic vaccine candidate against malaria infection, has been funded by Leidos, Inc., or Leidos, formerly Science Applications International Corporation, or SAIC, through its Malaria Vaccine Production and Support Services contract with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID. Clinical trials for Px533 are controlled by NIAID. 
 Biosimilars Market Opportunity 
 A biosimilar is a biologic product that has been demonstrated to be highly similar to a biologic product that is already licensed, also known as a reference product. By definition, a biosimilar expresses no clinically meaningful differences when compared to a reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. In the next several years, a large number of blockbuster products are expected to lose patent protection, opening up the market for biosimilars. 
 It is our belief that this emerging biosimilar market will be significant as several biologic products reach patent expiry. According to IMS Health, by 2020, eight biologic products are expected to lose patent protection in the EU5 (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK) and the US. Additionally, the abbreviated biosimilar 
 
-2- 
 
 regulatory pathways established via legislation such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), coupled with an increasing mandate for lower drug costs by governments and private payers, has positively positioned the biosimilars market for rapid expansion. 
 It has been reported that the global biosimilars market is expected to reach $10.9 billion by 2021 from $3.4 billion in 2016, at a compound annual growth rate of 26% from 2016 to 2020. We expect the biologics market to shift toward biosimilars over the coming years, much like generic small molecule drugs, which currently accounts for an estimated 89% of the dispensed prescription small molecule drug market in the United States. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our strategy is to utilize our Pfēnex Expression Technology® and our expertise in bioanalytical characterization and product development to become a leading protein therapeutics company focused on developing our own product candidates. 
 Our product candidate selection strategy focuses on products with large addressable markets, which are expected to be free of intellectual property barriers in major markets over our projected approval timelines, and for which our Pfēnex Expression Technology ® enables efficient and large-scale manufacture of high-value and difficult-to-manufacture proteins. Our pipeline of product candidates and preclinical products under development includes wholly-owned programs, programs that are being developed in a joint venture with Strides Arcolab Limited (Strides Arcolab), and certain other products that are being developed in collaboration with Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited (Jazz). In addition, we are also developing proprietary vaccine candidates that are being funded by the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) within the United States government. 
 The key elements to implement our strategy include the following: 
 

 | Develop and obtain regulatory approval of PF708 and maximize its commercial potential. We are actively completing the necessary items that we believe will satisfy the filing requirements for the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway in the United States to enable timeline regulatory approval as intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for Forteo expire. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated an immunogenicity/pharmacokinetics study in osteoporosis patients to compare the effects of PF708 and Forteo. The interim pharmacokinetic data from this study is expected in the second half of 2017 and the immunogenicity data is expected in the first half of 2018. We anticipate the results of this study will fulfill necessary filing requirements.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Develop and obtain regulatory approval of PF582 and maximize its commercial potential. Following the termination of our collaboration with Hospira, Inc., a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. (together, with Hospira, Pfizer), we are assessing the optimal development and commercialization strategy for PF582 to enable timely regulatory approval following the expected expiration of intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for Lucentis.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Develop vaccine programs primarily with non-dilutive government funding and other third-party grants. Using our Pfēnex Expression Technology®, we are developing Px563L as a next generation anthrax vaccine candidate that we believe will address the limitations of the existing approved product including compliance, cost and potential fulfillment of the Strategic National Stockpile. We reported interim results of an ongoing Phase 1a trial in the second half of 2016 and anticipate its completion in the first half of 2017. The development of Px563L is funded through BARDA under a cost plus fixed fee advanced development contract valued at up to approximately $143.5 million. NIAID continues to evaluate our vaccine candidate, Px533, against malaria infection. Clinical development of Px533 is controlled and funded by NIAID.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continue to develop our pipeline of product candidates. We intend to continue developing a pipeline of additional biosimilar candidates, including PF529, a biosimilar candidate to Neulasta® and PF688, a
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

biosimilar candidate to Cimzia®. We have also developed PF530, a biosimilar candidate to Betaseron. We continue to evaluate new product candidates to add to our pipeline.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Biosimilars Background 
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, was enacted in 2010, creating an abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilar products, referred to as the 351(k) pathway. We believe the FDAs guidance to date provides the necessary clarity regarding approval requirements under the 351(k) pathway to permit the development of our biosimilar product candidates and the ultimate submission of applications for marketing approval for these product candidates. The first biosimilar in the United States, Zarxio® (filgrastim-sndz), was approved by the FDA in 2015. 
 Biosimilars Development and Challenges 
 Product development progresses differently with biosimilars than with innovative biologic candidates. This is a result of abbreviated development requirements for the approval of biosimilars as compared to innovative biologic products. Because a biosimilar product may reference existing information regarding the safety, purity and potency of a previously approved biologic product, a biosimilar product application emphasizes analytical characterization to demonstrate similarity between the biosimilar and the reference product, which regulators have already found to be safe and effective. 
 The development of proteins, such as biosimilars, requires several competencies which represent both challenges and barriers to entry. Due to their inherent complexity, proteins require the use of living organisms to efficiently produce them at large scale. Traditional techniques for protein production employ a trial and error approach to production organism, or production strain, selection and process optimization, which is inherently inefficient and typically produces suboptimal results. This historically inefficient process provides barriers to create or replicate complex proteins, adds significant time to market and results in the high cost of goods typical of biologic therapeutics. Together, these limitations pose significant hurdles for companies interested in entering the market with biosimilar and therapeutic equivalents to branded products. 
 Our Approach 
 Our patented protein production platform, Pfēnex Expression Technology®, allows us to address hurdles to development and enable our product candidates. We believe our technology confers several important competitive advantages compared to traditional techniques for protein production, including the ability to produce complex proteins with higher accuracy and greater degree of protein purity, as well as speed and cost advantages. Our platform utilizes a proprietary high throughput robotically-enabled parallel approach, which allows the construction and testing of thousands of unique protein production variables in parallel, thereby allowing us to produce and characterize complex proteins while reducing the time and cost of development and long-term production. 
 We have replaced the traditional, trial and error approach to protein production with a simultaneous, parallel processing model that allows the construction and testing of thousands of unique protein production variables in parallel. This technology, which became our Pfēnex Expression Technology® was originated at Mycogen Corporation and further developed at The Dow Chemical Company , collectively, over a period of 20 years, and was assigned to us in the 2009 spinout to form the technology basis of our company. We have continued to improve the technology for the specific use in biopharmaceuticals development and manufacturing. We believe our platform delivers a significant competitive advantage for protein production, including higher accuracy, greater degree of protein purity, speed and lower costs.

Pfēnex Expression Technology®
Protein Production Overview 
 Protein production is a fundamental activity necessary for biological drug development and manufacturing. The most common method of manufacturing therapeutic proteins involves the use of engineered microorganisms. Proteins produced using these organisms are referred to as recombinant proteins. Recombinant proteins are produced by inserting DNA, or a gene, that codes for the protein, into a cell which then acts as a protein production factory. Typically, this is accomplished by inserting DNA into an expression vector, which contains genetic control elements that can be used to turn the gene on and off. 
 Our platform is based on automated high-throughput screening of large libraries of novel, genetically engineered P. fluorescens bacterial expression strains. The libraries contain thousands of expression strains which are constructed from a large inventory of expression vectors, or genetic elements, incorporated into engineered P. fluorescens host strains. We then employ automated, robotically enabled parallel high-throughput screening, incorporating extensive bioanalytical testing, in order to select strains from the library which express the protein of interest at optimal yields, purity and potency. Extensive fermentation scouting experiments on the selected strains allows for the identification of a final production strain with further improvements in the yield of the active therapeutic protein. 
 Our patented Pfēnex Expression Technology® is capable of identifying a final production strain in approximately nine weeks compared to approximately one year or more in the typical case, if even possible, compared to the traditional trial and error approach as illustrated in the diagram below. 
Our Pfēnex Expression Technology® platform consists of three primary elements that, when combined, deliver a significant competitive advantage for protein production that differentiates us in the biopharmaceutical industry.

The three elements include: 
 

 | Robust Protein Production Organism
--+-----------------------------------


 | Creation of Extensive Library of Protein Expression Variants
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


 | Robotically Enabled High Throughput Screening
--+----------------------------------------------

Robust Protein Production Organism 
 P. fluorescens has been used industrially where it has efficiently produced complex proteins. We exploit certain attributes of the P. fluorescens bacterium that enables us to rapidly identify the optimal strain for a specific protein of interest. The favorable attributes of the P. fluorescens bacterium include: 
 

 | Secretion of soluble protein into the bacterial periplasm, or the space between the inner and outer membrane in gram negative bacteria, resulting in increased recovery yields of properly folded protein
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | P. fluorescens genome allows for modifications, including deleting protease genes, or nucleotides that provide instructions for synthesis of RNA into a specific protease, and inserting chaperone and/or disulfide bond isomerase genes, or nucleotides that provide instructions for synthesis of RNA into a specific chaperone or disulfide isomerase, which overall increase the quality and production of properly folded active full length proteins
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Selection of expression strains without the use of antibiotics
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


 | High cell density fermentation due to its obligate aerobe growth nature, or bacterium that can only grow in the presence of oxygen, which improves the protein production for characterization, enables consistent scale-up and long-term low cost of goods
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creation of Extensive Library of Protein Expression Variants 
 We have developed an extensive toolbox of protein production variants that can be readily accessed for finding the best choice for manufacturing of a specific protein. This toolbox is continuously growing due to our ongoing research and development efforts. We construct libraries of thousands of unique expression strain variants by combining engineered P. fluorescens host strains with proprietary expression vectors. The engineered P. fluorescens strains have reduced expression of protein degrading enzymes and/or increased levels of folding elements while the expression vectors consist of plasmids with engineered genetic elements including promoters, ribosome binding sites and secretion leaders. Determining which of these variants will improve production of any particular protein cannot be determined from the amino acid sequence of the protein of interest. As a result, we employ the automated high throughput screening of a large library of the strain variants in order to select the strain that produces the protein of interest at optimal purity, yield and potency. 
Robotically Enabled High Throughput Screening 
 Our high-throughput automation supports simultaneous, parallel evaluation of thousands of unique protein production alternatives, enabling rapid identification of the optimal production strain for the protein of interest. Our protein production technology employs rapid construction of protein production strains and testing thousands of unique variants evaluated through automated sample analysis to determine the titer, or quantity of the product per unit volume, of high quality protein each expression strain produces, which can then be analyzed through our high throughput analytical capacity. Our proprietary, robotically enabled automated high throughput screening process, along with our optimized production organism and toolbox of variants, as well as our expertise in analytical characterization, expedites the development of an optimal protein production engine from approximately one year in a typical case for traditional approaches, if at all possible, to approximately nine weeks with our Pfēnex Expression Technology®. 
 Reagent Proteins 
 Utilizing our Pfēnex Expression Technology®, we supply preclinical and cGMP-grade CRM197 to the biopharmaceutical and vaccine development community. We currently have supply agreements for the supply of cGMP CRM197.

Our Product Candidates 
 The development of our own portfolio of product candidates has been enabled by our successful history of meeting analytically rigorous client specifications of protein quality, yield and potency using our Pfēnex Expression Technology®. Our pipeline includes product candidates and preclinical products under development in various stages of development. Details of our pipeline are included below. 
 Therapeutic Equivalent, Biosimilar and Next Generation Candidates 
 PF708  Teriparatide 
 One of our lead product candidates, PF708, is a peptide product candidate that is being developed as a therapeutic equivalent to the reference listed drug Forteo, an injectable prescription medicine marketed by Eli Lilly for the treatment of osteoporosis patients at high risk of fractures. Teriparatide is a shortened version of the naturally occurring parathyroid hormone (amino acids 1-34) that promotes bone growth. To date, we have demonstrated production of teriparatide in quantities that we believe predict a competitive cost of goods. Despite Forteos status as a biologic peptide currently manufactured in E. coli, due to its size (less than or equal to 40 amino acids), it is considered a small molecule. As a result, we are developing PF708 pursuant to the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway in the United States. 
Market Overview 
 The global osteoporosis market represents a significant opportunity, with product sales that are estimated to grow to approximately $5.2 billion in the United States, Japan and the five major European Markets in 2021. Treatment with teriparatide is the only treatment approach that promotes bone growth currently available for the treatment of osteoporosis. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), it is estimated that approximately 44 million Americans either have osteoporosis or are at increased risk due to low bone mass (osteopenia). Forteo (marketed as Forsteo in Europe) is the only product currently approved that builds bone primarily by increasing the activity of osteoblasts (cells that deposit bone). Worldwide sales of Forteo were approximately $1.4 billion in 2015, according to Eli Lilly. 
Development 
 We have performed an extensive bioanalytical comparative analysis of PF708 and Forteo. Based on what we believe to be equivalent results to date, we have not conducted preclinical in vivo studies for safety or efficacy purposes prior to initiating clinical investigation. We have also completed an initial assessment of the PF708 and Forteo injection pens, and we believe that the two injection devices are functionally equivalent. We completed a pharmacokinetic bioequivalence study in healthy subjects in the first half of 2016, and we initiated a comparative immunogenicity/pharmacokinetics study in osteoporosis patients in the fourth quarter of 2016. The interim pharmacokinetic data from this study is expected in the second half of 2017 and the immunogenicity data is expected in the first half of 2018.We anticipate that the study results will support the potential licensure of PF708 under the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway in the United States. 
PF582  Ranibizumab 
 PF582, our other lead product candidate, is a biosimilar product candidate to Lucentis (ranibizumab), indicated for the treatment of visual impairment due to neovascular, or wet, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), macular edema following retinal vein occlusion, choroidal neovascularization secondary to pathologic myopia, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetic macular edema. 
 
-7- 
 
Market Overview 
 Lucentis achieved approximately $3.6 billion in global product sales in 2015. By the second quarter of 2018, markets with 2015 Lucentis sales of approximately $530 million are expected to lose patent protection, and become available to biosimilars. By the second quarter of 2020, markets with an additional $1.8 billion in 2015 Lucentis sales are expected to lose patent protection and become available for biosimilars, and after January 2022 markets with an additional $1.2 billion in 2015 sales are expected to also lose patent protection. 
 Given the characteristics of the patient populations for each of its approved indications, we believe ranibizumab has attractive long-term growth prospects. In addition, we believe, the market is underpenetrated for the approved indications allowing future growth opportunities particularly for lower cost biosimilars. 
 

 | Wet AMDAge-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is the leading cause of severe vision loss in people over age 60, and it impacts approximately 30-50 million people worldwide. AMD occurs when the center of the retina, known as the macula, deteriorates. In the United States, approximately 15 million people suffer from AMD. Wet AMD accounts for about 10% of all cases of AMD and about 600,000 new cases of wet AMD are diagnosed each year globally.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Diabetic Macular EdemaDiabetic macular edema, or DME, is the leading cause of blindness in young adults in developed countries. The global prevalence of DME is approximately 21 million people. Worldwide, 285 million adults suffer from diabetes, and the number of adults who suffer from diabetes is projected to increase by 69% in developing countries and 20% in developed countries from 2010 to 2030. Approximately 28% of patients with type 2 diabetes and 12% of patients with type 1 diabetes will develop DME.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Retinal Vein OcclusionRetinal vein occlusion, or RVO, is the blockage of the small veins that carry blood away from the retina, potentially causing glaucoma and loss of vision. RVO affects more than one million people in the United States and 16.4 million people globally. In the United States, approximately 193,000 new cases of RVO are diagnosed each year.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Myopic Choroidal NeovascularizationMyopic choroidal neovascularization, or mCNV, is a complication of severe near-sightedness that can lead to blindness. In mCNV, new, abnormal blood vessels grow directly into the retina. These vessels may break and leak blood or fluid into the retina, which can cause irreversible central vision loss. mCNV affects approximately 41,000 people in the US, and it most commonly affects people between ages 45 and 64. It is estimated that mCNV exists in 5%-10% of highly myopic patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Development 
 We have completed extensive bioanalytical similarity studies comparing PF582 to multiple lots of United States and European Union sourced Lucentis, as well as comparability studies between multiple lots of PF582 at the pilot scale and current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, commercial scale. We have also completed a preclinical study using an animal model that demonstrated, when injected into animal eyes, PF582 and Lucentis yielded similar tolerability and pharmacological profiles. Based on our analytical and preclinical data package, the FDA granted us a Biosimilar Initial Advisory Meeting which was held in January 2014 to discuss the data we had generated to date, our comparative clinical trial design and our strategy for the comparison of European Union and United States licensed reference products. In the subsequent meeting minutes, the FDA indicated that our analytical data appear acceptable to support the development of PF582 as a biosimilar candidate to Lucentis. 
 In the third quarter of 2016, we announced the results of a randomized Phase 1/2 trial in patients with wet AMD. We believe that positive results from a future global comparative clinical trial should provide sufficient data to seek and secure marketing approval in our target markets.

Px563L 
 Px563L is a novel anthrax vaccine candidate based on a recombinant modified form (mutant) of the protective antigen from Bacillus anthracis (anthrax). We are developing Px563L in response to the United States governments unmet demand for increased quantity, stability and dose sparing regimens of anthrax vaccine. We believe that Px563L can address each of these demands. We initiated a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1a trial in healthy subjects in the second half of 2015 to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of Px563L, and we announced the interim analysis results in the second half of 2016. Findings indicated that the vaccine was well-tolerated, with the potential to afford immunogenicity protection against anthrax infection after only two injections (vs. three for the currently licensed anthrax vaccine product). The development of Px563L is funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) through BARDA under a contract providing up to $143.5 million in funding. 
 Market Overview 
 In October 2001, letters contaminated with anthrax spores were delivered to government officials and members of the media in the United States. As a result of these attacks, 22 people became infected with anthrax and five people died. In response to this and other terrorist attacks around the world, the biodefense market has grown dramatically. In December 2016 the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) signed a procurement contract for BioThrax valued at up to $911 million to supply to the Strategic National Stockpile that represents approximately 29.4 million doses through September 2021. The federal government spends billions of dollars in biodefense through HHS, CDC, NIAID and Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response. In 2013, the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act, or PAHPRA, which was originally passed in 2006 to improve the United States public health and medical preparedness and response capabilities for emergencies, authorized $2.8 billion for the procurement of countermeasures for biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear attacks. If successful with clinical development, we believe we may be able to enter into a procurement relationship with the US federal government to supply a next generation recombinant protective antigen (rPA) based anthrax vaccine to the Strategic National Stockpile. 
Development 
 In preclinical animal studies, Px563L has resulted in a greater immune response than the only available anthrax vaccine, BioThrax, and has the potential to provide longer protective immunity with fewer vaccinations. Through the application of our Pfēnex Expression Technology® we have developed a robust production strain for manufacturing that has demonstrated an ability to produce large amounts of mutant recombinant protective antigen, or mrPA. 
 In August 2016, we announced positive immunogenicity and safety data from Day 70 analysis of the Px563L anthrax vaccine study. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1a study enrolled three cohorts in a dose-escalating manner (10 mcg, 50 mcg and 80 mcg of antigen). Within each cohort, subjects received Px563L, RPA563 or placebo in an 8:8:2 ratio. Subjects were administered two doses of vaccine or placebo 28 days apart. Interim results indicated that the vaccine was well-tolerated, with the potential to afford immunogenicity protection against anthrax infection after only two injections (vs. three for the currently licensed anthrax vaccine product). Immunogenicity was assessed by toxin-neutralizing antibody (TNA) expressed as 50% neutralizing factor (NF50), with a threshold value ³0.56 correlating with significant survival in animal models of anthrax infection. On Day 70, 100% of Px563L subjects at the 10 mcg and 80 mcg dose levels achieved a TNA NF50 ³0.56, and 87.5% at the 50 mcg dose level achieved the target threshold. An additional success criterion for assessing anthrax vaccine immunogenicity is for the lower confidence limit (LCL), or the lower bound of 95% confidence interval, of the percentage of subjects who met or exceeded the TNA NF50 threshold of 0.56, to be greater than or equal to 40%. On Day 70, all doses of Px563L exceeded this threshold, which was established by the currently licensed anthrax vaccine for the indication of post-exposure prophylaxis.

In addition, we have developed a production process for the large scale manufacturing of bulk mrPA. We announced positive interim results from a Phase 1a study in healthy subjects in the second half of 2016, and we anticipate study completion in the first half of 2017. 
 Additional Products Under Development 
 Given the Jazz collaboration and our recent pipeline review, we have decided to advance the hematology assets that are part of the Jazz collaboration ahead of the PF530 biosimilar Betaseron opportunity. The expenses associated with PF530 will be reduced as part of the portfolio re-alignment. We completed a Phase 1 trial of PF530, a biosimilar candidate to Betaseron, in 2015 which enrolled 12 healthy subjects. Based on the analysis of the trial PK and PD parameters, no meaningful differences between PF530 compared to the reference compound were observed. Potential strategic opportunities for the PF530 program will be explored, given the successful advancement of PF530 and the positive regulatory feedback. 
 We also have a number of preclinical products under development. We are currently in process development for PF529, a peg-filgrastim biosimilar candidate to Neulasta, as well as for PF690 pegaspargase, a biosimilar candidate to the reference product Oncaspar. Regulatory feedback for PF529 was received in 2016 and supported the feasibility of development under the 351(k) biosimilar pathway. We continue to evaluate the potential resource requirements and timeline for development. Additional products in process development include PF444-human growth hormone, and PF688-certolizumab-pegol, which are being developed as biosimilars of Genotropin, and Cimzia, respectively. 
 Collaborations, Joint Development, and Licenses 
 Jazz Pharmaceuticals 
 In July 2016, we entered into a development and license agreement, or the Jazz Agreement, with Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited, or Jazz, for the development and commercialization of multiple early stage hematology product candidates. The agreement also includes an option for Jazz to negotiate a license for a recombinant pegaspargase product candidate with us. Under the Jazz Agreement, we received an upfront and option payment totaling $15 million in July 2016 and may be eligible to receive additional payments of up to $166 million based on achievement of certain research and development, regulatory and sales related milestones, including up to approximately $41 million for certain non-sales-related milestones. The total milestones are categorized as follows: $7 million are based on achievement of certain research and development milestones; $34 million for certain regulatory milestones; and $125 million for sales-related milestones. For the non-sales-related milestones, we conducted an evaluation of whether they will be recorded using the milestone method and as a result of this evaluation, we estimate approximately $7 million of these non-sales-related milestones are deemed to be substantive. We may also be eligible to receive tiered royalties on worldwide sales of any products resulting from the collaboration. We and Jazz will both be contributing to the development efforts. Unless terminated earlier, the Jazz Agreement will continue on a product-by-product basis for as long as Jazz is commercializing or having commercialized the products under the Jazz Agreement. 
Pfizer 
 In February 2015, we entered into a development and license agreement with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of PF582. Under the terms of the development and license agreement, in March of 2015 we received a non-refundable license payment of $51 million on receipt of antitrust approval. We regained the full rights to PF582 following Pfizers strategic review of the current therapeutic focus of its biosimilar pipeline. To that effect, in August 2016, we entered into a termination agreement, pursuant to which the development and license agreement was terminated and all rights to PF582 were returned to us.

Strides Arcolab 
 In December 2012, we entered into a Joint Development & License Agreement, or JDLA, with Strides Arcolab, to develop biosimilar products according to development plans to be mutually agreed upon by us and Strides Arcolab. Under such development plans, we will generally be responsible for establishing and characterizing a research cell bank of the protein production strain and developing a manufacturing process and analytical methods, while Strides Arcolab will generally be responsible for developing master and working cell banks for the applicable protein production strain, developing a formulation for the applicable biosimilar product, manufacturing the biosimilar for Phase 1 trials, conducting preclinical and Phase 1 trials and managing regulatory matters. Each of Strides Arcolab and us will bear our own costs for the aforementioned development activities. Each of Strides Arcolab and us must use commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the objectives set forth in the development plan for each biosimilar product and certain milestones set forth in the JDLA. Except pursuant to the JDLA during its term, neither we nor Strides Arcolab may develop, manufacture, supply or commercialize any product that is being or has been developed under the agreement or assist any third party to do the same. 
 In March 2013, we entered into a joint venture agreement, or JVA, with Strides Arcolab to form a joint venture company, or JV, to develop and commercialize biosimilar products developed under the JDLA that have completed Phase 1 trials. Under the terms of the JVA, when formed, we will own a 49% equity interest in the JV, while Strides Arcolab will own a 51% equity interest in the JV. Both we and Strides Arcolab will have equal board representation and equal voting rights. 
 In February 2015, we notified Strides Arcolab that we were removing PF530 Interferon beta-1b, PF726 PEGylated Interferon beta-1b and PF529 PEGylated filgrastim from the JDLA. We intend to independently advance these candidates as wholly owned products. 
 Currently there are two biosimilar candidates for development under the JDLA and potential further development and commercialization by the JV: 
 

 | PEGylated interferon alpha-2a (a biosimilar candidate to Roches Pegasys); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Human growth hormone (a biosimilar candidate to Pfizers Genotropin).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 After transfer of a biosimilar product to Strides Arcolab, Strides Arcolab will be responsible for manufacturing such biosimilar product, preparing and filing all regulatory filings and conducting the Phase 1 study. Upon successful completion of the first Phase 1 trial for each biosimilar candidate, the product will transfer to the JV and the JV will be responsible for all regulatory filings and approvals, clinical trials, commercialization strategies and distribution of the applicable biosimilar product upon approvals. Also transferred to the JV are all associated data, rights and assets, including any inventions developed by us or Strides Arcolab under the JDLA and all intellectual property rights therein. The JDLA will continue on a biosimilar product-by-biosimilar product basis until successful completion of the first Phase 1 trial for such biosimilar product. Either we or Strides Arcolab may terminate the JDLA in its entirety for the other partys insolvency, or in its entirety or with respect to the applicable biosimilar product for the other partys material breach of the JDLA. In addition, if the JVA is terminated in its entirety, the JDLA will automatically terminate. 
 The JVA will remain in effect so long as there is at least one biosimilar product under development or commercialization by the JV. If the JV fails to initiate the first commercial sale of a biosimilar product within the timeframe set forth in the plan for such biosimilar product, either we or Strides Arcolab may terminate the JVA with respect to such biosimilar product upon notice to the other party. Beginning March 7, 2018, either we or Strides Arcolab may offer to sell our or Strides Arcolabs entire equity interest in the JV to the other party, at which time the other party must either buy the first partys entire interest in the JV or sell to the first party such other partys entire interest in the JV. In addition, if either we or Strides Arcolab materially breaches the JVA or become insolvent and fail to cure such breach or insolvency within a specified period of time, the other party 
 
-11- 
 
 may require the breaching or insolvent party to buy such other partys entire equity interest in the JV or to sell such breaching or insolvent partys entire equity interest in the JV to such other party. 
 The Dow Chemical Company 
 On November 30, 2009, we entered into a series of agreements with Dow Global Technologies LLC and/or The Dow Chemical Company, or collectively, Dow, including a technology assignment agreement, a technology licensing agreement, and a grant-back and technology license agreement. Under the technology assignment agreement, Dow assigned to us certain patents, know-how and trademarks relating to our Pfēnex Expression Technology®. Under the technology licensing agreement, Dow granted us exclusive licenses to exploit certain patents relating to RNA viruses and oral immunization methods (each of which were subsequently terminated), and certain amended recombinant cells, and a non-exclusive license to exploit certain patents relating to production and isolation techniques for peptides and proteins made using our Pfēnex Expression Technology®. Under the grant-back and technology license agreement, we granted to Dow exclusive and non-exclusive licenses under certain patents and know-how relating to our Pfēnex Expression Technology® to use certain biological materials to make, use and commercialize products in certain fields of use that do not include human therapeutics. 
 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
 In July 2010, we entered into a contract with BARDA, a division of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to develop a production strain and process for the production of bulk recombinant Protective Antigen, or rPA, from anthrax. Under the contract, we agreed to provide protein production and process development services to BARDA. The contract was amended several times to advance development of the product, and BARDA exercised options to provide additional funding and extend the term of the contract. In December 2014, we filed the investigational new drug, or IND, application for Px563L. BARDA extended the contract in December 2014 and provided additional funding, increasing the total contract to $25.2 million. A total of $24.8 million had been recognized as revenue under the development contract, which was completed in August 2015. 
 In August 2015, we entered into a five-year, cost plus fixed fee contract valued at up to $143.5 million with BARDA for the advanced development of Px563L, which is a mutant recombinant protective antigen anthrax vaccine. The contract consists of a 30-month base period with total funding up to $15.9 million that will fund activities related to cGMP manufacturing of drug product and a Phase 1a clinical study. In addition to the base period, there are eight option periods, with potential additional funding of up to $127.6 million that will fund activities including completion of a Phase 1b clinical study, a Phase 2 clinical study and non-clinical efficacy studies, as well as manufacturing technology transfer and optimization, process and analytical method validation and consistency lot manufacture. In addition to the base period, BARDA has exercised additional phases of the development contract effective January 2017, allowing for the continuing development of Px563L. The phase 2 study could initiate in 2018, provided the program continues to successfully advance with the support of BARDA. We believe the successful completion of the activities under this contract could lead to a procurement contract for supply of Px563L to the Strategic National Stockpile. 
 As the prime contractor, we are responsible for performing activities under a research plan proposed by us and accepted by BARDA. We are also obligated under the contract to satisfy various federal reporting requirements, including technical reporting with respect to our development activities, reporting with respect to intellectual property and financial reporting. In addition, certain technical documents and our clinical trial protocols may be reviewed by BARDA prior to their finalization and/or submission. 
 Under standard government contracting terms, the government receives only limited rights for government use of certain of our pre-existing data and certain data produced with non-federal funding, to the extent such data are required for delivery to BARDA under the project. The United States government receives unlimited rights to 
 
-12- 
 
 use and disclose new data first produced under the project with BARDA funding. If the product is successfully developed and achieves marketing authorization, we would have the commercial rights to the anthrax vaccine; provided that the United States government is entitled to a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to practice or have practiced any patent on an invention that is conceived or first reduced to practice under the project, and may obtain additional rights if we do not elect to retain ownership of a subject invention or if we do not satisfy certain disclosure and patent prosecution obligations with respect to a subject invention. Our contract with BARDA does not entitle the government to any sales royalties or other post-commercialization financial rights. 
 BARDA is entitled to terminate the project for convenience at any time, and is not obligated to provide continued funding beyond current year amounts allotted from Congressionally approved annual appropriations. 
 The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) 
 In September 2012, we entered into a contract with NIAID for the development of a next generation anthrax vaccine. Under the contract, which was amended in April 2013 and November 2013, we have agreed to provide services to NIAID for approximately 25 months under a cost plus fixed fee contract with a total value of approximately $2.2 million. In addition to the base period, NIAID has 13 options to extend the term of the contract, with payments totaling approximately $22.9 million. NIAID exercised an option effective January 2015 and another effective May 2016. 
 As the prime contractor, we are responsible for performing activities under a research plan proposed by us and accepted by NIAID. We are also obligated under the contract to satisfy various federal reporting requirements, including technical reporting with respect to our development activities, reporting with respect to intellectual property and financial reporting. 
 Under standard government contracting terms, the government receives only limited rights for government use of certain of our pre-existing data and certain data produced with non-federal funding, to the extent such data are required for delivery to NIAID under the project. The United States government receives unlimited rights to use and disclose new data first produced under the project with NIAID funding. If an anthrax vaccine is successfully developed and achieves marketing authorization we would have the commercial rights to the anthrax vaccine; provided that the United States government is entitled to a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to practice or have practiced any patent on an invention that is conceived or first reduced to practice under the project, and may obtain additional rights if we do not elect to retain ownership of a subject invention or if we do not satisfy certain disclosure and patent prosecution obligations with respect to a subject invention. Our contract with NIAID does not entitle the government to any sales royalties or other post-commercialization financial rights. 
 NIAID is entitled to terminate the project for convenience at any time, and is not obligated to provide continued funding beyond current year amounts allotted from Congressionally approved annual appropriations. 
 Customers 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had generated only limited revenue from government contracts, service agreements, collaboration agreements, and reagent protein product sales. Our total revenue was $60.2 million, $9.6 million and $10.6 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, a significant portion of our revenue was derived from recognizing $45.8 million in revenue upon termination of the Pfizer agreement in August 2016, in addition to revenue derived from development and license agreements. In 2015 and 2014, a significant portion of our revenue was derived from developing proprietary vaccine candidates for government agencies. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2016, Pfizer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2015, BARDA and Pfizer each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2014, BARDA, NIAID and Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.

Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the European Economic Area, at European Union and national Member State level, and in United States, at the federal, state and local level, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, promotion, advertising, storage, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and export and import of drugs and biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
European Economic Area Regulation 
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, comprising the European Community (European Union) plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, the information that must be submitted to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or to the competent authorities in the relevant European Union Member States varies depending on whether the biological medicinal product is a new product, whose quality, safety and efficacy has not previously been demonstrated in humans or a product whose known biological active substance and certain other properties are similar to those of a previously authorized (reference) biological medicinal product. The European Directive 2001/83/EC as amended defines a medicinal product as any substance or combination of substances: 

 | presented as having properties for treating or preventing disease in human beings; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | which may be used in or administered to human beings either with a view to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions by exerting a pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action, or to making a medical diagnosis.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Directive 2001/83/EC as amended further defines the category of biological medicinal products as: 
 

 | a product, the active substance of which is a biological substance. A biological substance is a substance that is produced by or extracted from a biological source and that needs for its characterization and the determination of its quality a combination of physico-chemical-biological testing, together with the production process and its control.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Examples of biological medicinal products include recombinant proteins, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and products derived from human blood or plasma. 
 Approval of New Biological Medicinal Products 
 In the EEA, all medicinal products (biological or not) can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of MA: 
 The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the CHMP of the EMA, is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as medicinal products derived from certain biotechnology processes (including biotechnology-derived proteins such as the ones we make), orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes and auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union. 
 National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the 
 
-14- 
 
 Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in other Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. 
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 More concretely, the requirements for centralized marketing authorization of a new biological medicinal product in the EEA generally include but are not limited to: 
 

 | submission of the results of pharmaceutical (physico-chemical, biological or microbiological) tests and preclinical (toxicological and pharmacological) tests through laboratory tests and animal studies in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the competent authorities of a Clinical Trial Application, or CTA, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must include the protocol, Investigators Brochure, Investigational Medicinal Product-related data, and independent Ethics Committee approval;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission of the results of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the quality, safety and efficacy of the product for each indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a statement to the effect that clinical trials carried outside the European Union meet the ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission of an application for marketing authorization to the EMA or to the competent authorities of the relevant EU Member States;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | establishment of the applicant in the EEA;
--+-------------------------------------------


 | description of the qualitative and quantitative particulars of all constituents of the medicinal product;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | evaluation of the potential environmental risks posed by the medicinal product;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | description of the manufacturing method, description of the control measures employed by the manufacturer, and a document showing that the manufacturer is authorized in his own country to produce medicinal products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a summary of product characteristics, therapeutic indications, adverse reactions, dosage, pharmaceutical form, route of administration and expected shelf life;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | additional information for specific classes of medicinal products, such as a Vaccine Antigen Master File documentation for vaccine products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a summary of the pharmacovigilance system, the risk management plan describing the risk-management system, and proof that the applicant has the services of a qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance as well as the necessary means for fulfilling the EU pharmacovigilance obligations including the notification of any adverse reaction suspected of occurring either in the EEA or in a third country; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | review by EMAs CHMP or the competent authorities in the relevant European Union Member States and approval of the marketing authorization application.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of the products structure, purity and biological activity, as well as animal studies to determine toxicity and pharmacology. An Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) sponsor must submit a CTA to the competent authority prior to initiation of human clinical trials. The application process to perform a clinical trial in the EEA is governed on a country-by-country basis. A sponsor must apply in 
 
-15- 
 
 each country in which it intends to conduct any part of a human clinical trial. While the process is similar in most countries, additional materials may be required in certain instances. For example, in many, but not all European countries, a sponsor must submit a copy of the insurance coverage obtained to cover the clinical study. Australia and New Zealand adhere to EMA guidelines with respect to the regulation of IMPs and clinical trials. 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, and having met all criteria set forth by Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the applicant may choose to proceed with submission of marketing authorization application. If the application is accepted for review in the Centralized Procedure, within 210 days (excluding clock stops), the EMAs CHMP will issue an opinion on whether the conditions for granting market authorization are satisfied. During the review period, the scientific committees will review the scientific data, may request for independent testing of the medicinal product, its starting materials, or other constituent materials, may request supplemental information from the applicant, may request for proof of cGMP compliance of the manufacturer, and may request for said manufacturing facilities to be inspected. 
 Accelerated Review 
 Under the Centralized Procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the EMAs CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding clock stops. 
Approval of Similar Biological Medicinal Products 
 Similar biological medicinal product applications of medicinal products authorized via the Centralized Procedure have automatic access to the Centralized Procedure. Similar biological medicinal products that do not fall under the mandatory scope can, at the request of the applicant, be accepted for consideration under the Centralized Procedure, when the applicant shows that the medicinal product constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or when the applicant shows that the granting of a Community authorization for the medicinal product is in the interest of patients at European Union level. 
 A similar biological medicinal product, also known as a biosimilar, is a product that is similar to a biological medicine that has already been authorized, the so-called reference medicinal product. The active substance of a similar biological medicinal product is a known biological active substance and similar to the one of the reference medicinal product. A similar biological medicinal product and its reference medicinal product are expected to have the same safety and efficacy profile and are generally used to treat the same conditions. 
 The similar nature of a biosimilar and a reference product is demonstrated by comprehensive comparability studies covering quality, biological activity, safety and efficacy. The dosage and route of administration should be the same while deviations in formulation or inactive substances require justification or further studies. Intended changes to improve efficacy are not compatible with a biosimilarity approach. The minimum expectation of data supplied with the application will include pharmaceutical, chemical, and biological preclinical data, as well as bioequivalence and bioavailability (bodily distribution and concentration) clinical data. The type and amount of additional information, such as toxicological and other preclinical and clinical data, is determined on a case-by-case basis. Unlike in the United States, the directives and guidelines governing the EEA do not explicitly provide for the designation of interchangeability of similar biological medicinal products, nor does the EMA submit an opinion on whether a biosimilar can be used interchangeably with its reference product. 
 EMA guidelines suggest that clinical trials comparing a biosimilar candidate to a reference medicinal product be designed such that they will demonstrate not only similar efficacy but also similar clinical outcome 
 
-16- 
 
 with respect to safety. Clinical trials designed to establish the expectation of equivalent clinical outcomes for any one patient require a sufficiently large number of patients in the study such that certain statistical measures are satisfied. As such, equivalence trials are usually more expensive and longer in duration than non-inferiority trials that may be employed in other medicinal product categories. The EMA recommends engaging in discussions with regulatory authorities if the use of a non-inferiority design is being considered. If a reference product is approved for more than one therapeutic indication, the efficacy and safety of the biosimilar has to be justified or, if necessary, demonstrated separately for each of the claimed indications. This may include a review of clinical experience and available literature data, or the execution of further non-clinical or appropriate clinical studies. 
 The EMA provides additional specific guidance and requirements for products being developed as biosimilar candidate to EEA-authorized Interferon-beta 1a or 1b and Interferon-alpha 2a or 2b. The guidance outlines specific types of preclinical data and clinical studies required to support the claim of biosimilarity. Additionally, the guidelines provide specific considerations for assessing clinical safety and for post-authorization pharmacovigilance monitoring. 
 European Union legislation provides (with respect to reference products for which a marketing authorization was applied for after October 30, 2005 under the Decentralized, Mutual Recognition and national procedures, or after November 20, 2005, for products authorized under the Centralized Procedure) for an eight-year period of data protection and ten-year period of market exclusivity for medicinal products which received marketing authorization in accordance with, respectively, Directive 2001/83/EC as amended or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 as amended. The provisions also state that if, during the first eight years of authorization, the holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which are deemed to have significant clinical benefit as compared to existing therapies, the original market exclusivity can be extended to a maximum of 11 years. The data and market exclusivity periods start from the date of the initial authorization, which for reference medicinal products authorized through the Centralized Procedure is the date of notification of the marketing authorization decision to the marketing authorization holder of the reference product. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Once granted, initial marketing authorization of a medicinal product is valid for five years. The authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance. At that point, once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid indefinitely or, if justified on grounds of pharmacovigilance, may be restricted to an additional five-year authorization period. 
 Marketing authorization holders are required to maintain a pharmacovigilance system and to maintain detailed records of all suspected adverse reactions in the EEA or in a third country. Serious suspected adverse reactions are to be communicated to the appropriate EEA regulatory authorities no later than 15 days after receipt of the information. EEA regulations require periodic safety reporting leading up to and following market authorization, based on a defined schedule, for as long as the product is marketed, or when immediately requested by regulatory authorities. An increase in incidents of adverse events or any cause for a change in opinion by the EMA pertaining to the risk-benefit balance may lead to suspension, variation, or revocation of marketing authorization and would severely impact our business. 
 EEA regulations also stipulate that regulators, such as the Competent Authorities of the EEA Member States, independently or coordinated by the EMA, may carry out repeated or unannounced inspections of the medicinal product manufacturer or at the premises of the marketing authorization holder, regarding compliance with cGMP principles and guidelines. Compliance issues identified at our facilities or at third-party manufacturers may disrupt clinical or commercial production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. This may result in the delay of clinical trials or commercial product launch. Discovery or problems with the product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, the manufacturer or the holder of a marketing authorization, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other EMA or EEA Competent Authority initiated action that could delay or prohibit future marketing. 
 
-17- 
 
 Additionally, new government regulations may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 
 United States Government Regulation 
 In the United States, section 351(i)(1) of the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, defines a biological product (biologic) as a: 
 

 | virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, protein (except any chemically synthesized polypeptide), or analogous product, applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of human beings. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain approval to market a new biologic varies depending on whether the application for the biological product is submitted under section 351(a) or section 351(k) of the PHSA. Any proposed biologic, including a new product whose safety, purity and potency has not previously been demonstrated in humans, may follow the Biologics License Application, or BLA, route as defined by section 351(a). However, a proposed biologic whose active ingredient(s) and certain other properties are highly similar (biosimilar) to those of a previously approved biologic may follow an abbreviated licensure pathway as defined by section 351(k) of the PHSA. The FDA, under the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, reviews and ultimately approves applications for biological products submitted under either pathway. 
 In addition, in the FDAs 2015 guidance document Biosimilars: Questions and Answers Regarding Implementation of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, the FDA clarified that it intends to regulate any polymer composed of 40 or fewer amino acids, and any polymer made entirely by chemical synthesis and composed of fewer than 100 amino acids, as drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and its implementing regulations, rather than as biologics under the PHSA, unless the polymer otherwise meets the statutory definition of a biological product. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with information regarding the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, and FDA review and approval of the NDA is necessary prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States. However, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may file an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, seeking approval of a generic copy of an approved branded product. Additionally, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may, under Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA, file an NDA that relies on studies not conducted by the applicant, or for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. 
 Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulation. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the drug development process, clinical testing, approval process or post-approval activities, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDAs refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 BLA/NDA Approval Process 
 The process generally required by the FDA before a biologic or drug product candidate may be marketed in the United States involves the following: 
 

 | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDAs current GLP regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
-18- 
 

 | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is initiated;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic, and the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA or NDA after successful completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;

 | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for substantive review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological products continued safety, purity and potency; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the BLA or NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the biologic product in the United States.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical studies. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical studies can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to commence. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each clinical protocol and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and an IRB at each site where the study is conducted must also approve the study. The IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. Clinical trials typically are conducted in three or four sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. 
 

 | Phase 1. The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2. The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks, and preliminarily evaluate efficacy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
-19- 
 

 | Phase 3. The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product, and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling and approval.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA or BLA for a product candidate on the sponsors agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the product. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A pivotal trial is a clinical study that is designed to generate substantial evidence of products safety and efficacy that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal trials are Phase 3 trials, but the FDA may accept results from Phase 2 trials if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need and the results are sufficiently robust. 
 Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Furthermore, the FDA, the IRB, or the clinical study sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical studies are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical study based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed information regarding the investigational product is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The NDA or BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the products chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs and BLAs is subject to an application user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. 
 Once an NDA or BLA has been submitted, the FDAs goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the products continued safety, purity and potency. Similarly, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the products quality and purity. 
 Before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will 
 
-20- 
 
 typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. If the FDA determines that the application, clinical data, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel product to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, and we and our partners may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. After the FDA evaluates a BLA or NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 trial or trials, and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical trials or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA or NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA may also approve the BLA or NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the products safety and effectiveness after commercialization. New government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDAs policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 
 Drugs and biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. Manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates, and expect to rely in the future on third parties for the production of commercial quantities. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our 
 
-21- 
 
 contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
 

 | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | adverse publicity, fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs and biologics may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant enforcement action and liability. 
 Abbreviated Licensure Pathway of Biological Products as Biosimilar or Interchangeable 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, or Affordable Care Act, or ACA, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which amended the PHSA and created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The BPCIA attempts to minimize duplicative testing, and thereby lower development costs and increase patient access to affordable treatments. An application for licensure of a biosimilar product under section 351(k) of the PHSA must include information demonstrating biosimilarity based upon the following, unless the FDA determines otherwise: 

 | analytical studies demonstrating that the proposed biosimilar product is highly similar to the approved product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | animal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | a clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more conditions for which the reference biologic product is licensed and intended to be used.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, an application submitted under the 351(k) pathway must include information demonstrating that: 
 

 | the proposed biosimilar product and reference product utilize the same mechanism of action for the condition(s) of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling, but only to the extent the mechanism(s) of action are known for the reference product;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
-22- 
 

 | the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously approved for the reference product;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the proposed biosimilar product are the same as those for the reference product; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the facility in which the biological product is manufactured, processed, packed and held meets standards designed to assure that the biological product continues to be safe, pure, and potent.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Biosimilarity, as defined in PHSA §351(i), means that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components; and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product. 
 In addition, section 351(k)(4) of the PHSA provides for a designation of interchangeability between the reference and biosimilar products, whereby the biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. To date, the FDA has not approved any biosimilar product as being interchangeable to the reference product. The higher standard of interchangeability must be demonstrated by information sufficient to show that: 
 

 | the proposed product is biosimilar to the reference product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


 | the proposed product is expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | for a product that is administered more than once to an individual, the risk to the patient in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the biosimilar and the reference product is no greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 FDA approval is required before a biosimilar may be marketed in the United States. However, complexities associated with the large and intricate structures of biological products and the process by which such products are manufactured pose significant hurdles to the FDAs implementation of the 351(k) approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. For example, the FDA has discretion over the kind and amount of scientific evidencelaboratory, preclinical and/or clinicalrequired to demonstrate biosimilarity to a licensed biological product. According to FDA guidance: 
 the implementation of an abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products can present challenges given the scientific and technical complexities that may be associated with the larger and typically more complex structure of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured. Most biological products are produced in a living system such as a microorganism, or plant or animal cells, whereas small molecule drugs are typically manufactured through chemical synthesis. 
 The FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence, provided by a sponsor to support a demonstration of biosimilarity, and recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach in the development of their biosimilar products. Biosimilar product applications thus may not be required to duplicate the entirety of preclinical and clinical testing used to establish the underlying safety and effectiveness of the reference product. However, the FDA may refuse to approve a biosimilar application if there is insufficient information to show that the active ingredients are the same or to demonstrate that any impurities or differences in active ingredients do not affect the safety, purity or potency of the biosimilar product. In addition, as with BLAs, biosimilar product applications will not be approved unless the product is manufactured in facilities designed to assure and preserve the biological products safety, purity and potency. 
 The submission of an application via the 351(k) pathway does not guarantee that the FDA will accept the application for filing and review, as the FDA may refuse to accept applications that it finds are insufficiently complete. The FDA will treat a biosimilar application or supplement as incomplete if, among other reasons, any 
 
-23- 
 
 applicable user fees assessed under the Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 have not been paid. In addition, the FDA may accept an application for filing but deny approval on the basis that the sponsor has not demonstrated biosimilarity, in which case the sponsor may choose to conduct further analytical, preclinical or clinical studies and submit a BLA for licensure as a new biological product under section 351(a) of the PHSA. 
 The timing of final FDA approval of a biosimilar for commercial distribution depends on a variety of factors, including whether the manufacturer of the branded product is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods, during which time the FDA is prohibited from approving any products that are biosimilar to the branded product. The FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application for twelve years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. Additionally, a biosimilar product sponsor may not submit an application under the 351(k) pathway for four years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. A reference product may also be entitled to exclusivity under other statutory provisions. For example, a reference product designated for a rare disease or condition (an orphan drug) may be entitled to seven years of exclusivity under section 360cc of the FFDCA, in which case no product that is biosimilar to the reference product may be approved until either the end of the twelve-year period provided under §351(k) or the end of the seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period, whichever occurs later. In certain circumstances, a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent, and thus block §351(k) applications from being approved on or after the patent expiration date. In addition, the FDA may under certain circumstances extend the exclusivity period for the reference product by an additional six months if the FDA requests, and the manufacturer undertakes, studies on the effect of its product in children, a so-called pediatric extension. 
 The first biological product determined to be interchangeable with a branded product for any condition of use is also entitled to a period of exclusivity, during which time the FDA may not determine that another product is interchangeable with the reference product for any condition of use. This exclusivity period extends until the earlier of: (1) one year after the first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable product; (2) 18 months after resolution of a patent infringement suit instituted under 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(6) against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product, based on a final court decision regarding all of the patents in the litigation or dismissal of the litigation with or without prejudice; (3) 42 months after approval of the first interchangeable product, if a patent infringement suit instituted under 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(6) against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product is still ongoing; or (4) 18 months after approval of the first interchangeable product if the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product has not been sued under 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(6). 
 Post Approval Requirements 
 After obtaining regulatory approval of a product, manufacturers may be required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of a BLA or a §351(k) application the FDA may require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the products safety or efficacy. 
 In addition, the holder of an approved BLA or §351(k) application is required to timely report certain adverse reactions and production problems involving its product to the FDA to provide updated safety and efficacy information and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for the product. Quality control and manufacturing procedures must also continue to conform to cGMPs after approval and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. 
 Patent Disputes under the BPCIA 
 The BPCIA includes a detailed framework for addressing potential patent disputes between biosimilar product and reference product sponsors. Within 20 days after being notified that FDA has accepted its application for review, a 351(k) applicant must provide a copy of its application, along with any other information that describes the manufacturing processes for the biosimilar product, to the reference product sponsors in-house counsel, the reference product sponsors outside counsel, and/or a representative of the owner of a patent 
 
-24- 
 
 exclusively licensed to the reference product sponsor with respect to the reference product who has retained a right to assert the patent or participate in litigation. The copy of the application and any other information provided are considered confidential information under the PHSA, and recipients are generally prohibited from disclosing anything contained therein and from using the information for any purposes other than to determine whether a patent infringement claim may reasonably be asserted. The reference product sponsor then has sixty days to provide the applicant with an initial list of patents that could reasonably be asserted. The reference product sponsor may also choose to designate patents that it would be willing to license to the applicant. 
 Within sixty days of receiving the initial list of patents from the reference product sponsor, the biosimilar applicant may provide the reference product sponsor with an initial list of patents that the applicant contends could reasonably be asserted by the reference product sponsor, and, for each patent on this list or the list provided by the reference product sponsor, must either (1) provide a claim-by-claim statement of the factual and legal basis for the applicants opinion that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed, or (2) provide a statement that the applicant does not intend to begin marketing its product prior to the patents expiration. The applicant must also respond to the reference product sponsors list of patents available for licensing. If the applicant provided any statement regarding the non-infringement, invalidity, or unenforceability of any of the patents-at-issue, the reference product sponsor has sixty days to rebut such arguments and to provide the factual and legal basis for the reference product sponsors option that the patent(s) will be infringed by the commercial marketing of the proposed biosimilar product. 
 Once the applicant has received the statement of the basis for the reference product sponsors opinion, the parties have fifteen days to engage in good faith negotiations to agree on which if any of the patents will be the subject of an infringement action. The PHSA contemplates that the parties may not reach an agreement within this timeframe, in which case additional patent list exchange procedures are triggered. The applicant must first notify the reference product sponsor of the number of patents that it believes should be the subject of an infringement action. Subsequently, within five days of this notification and on a date agreed upon by the parties, the parties must simultaneously exchange lists of the patents that each believes should be the subject of an infringement action. The reference product sponsor may not list a greater number of patents than the number listed by the applicant, though if the applicant lists no patents the reference product sponsor may still list just one. Under this provision, the biosimilar applicant thus controls the number of patents that will be the subject of the infringement action. 
 Following this last list exchange, the reference product sponsor has thirty days to bring an infringement action for each patent on both lists. Alternatively, if the parties successfully negotiate an agreement regarding the patents that will form the basis for an infringement action, the reference product sponsor has thirty days after such agreement to bring an infringement action for each of the negotiated patents. Within thirty days of being served with a complaint in the infringement action, the applicant must provide notice to the FDA, and the FDA will publish notice of the complaint in the Federal Register. Unlike the Hatch-Waxman Act, under which a reference product sponsor must list its patents in the Orange Book, and the FDA will suspend its review for thirty months if a reference product sponsor files a patent infringement suit, the BPCIA does not direct the FDA to suspend review of the biosimilar product application as a result of the patent dispute. 
 For patents that are issued or licensed after the reference product sponsor has identified its initial list, the reference product sponsor may supplement its initial list with the additional patents within thirty days of the new patents issuance or licensing. The biosimilar applicant must then respond within thirty days with a statement of the factual and legal basis for its opinion that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed, or that the applicant does not intend to begin marketing its product prior to the patents expiration. However, these patents do not become subject to the additional negotiation and list exchange procedures of the BPCIA, but rather are subject to preliminary injunction (PI) procedures. The BPCIA requires the biosimilar applicant to provide 180 day notice to the reference product sponsor of the applicants intent to market the biosimilar product, and the reference product sponsor may then seek a PI on any patents there were included on any of the patent lists initially exchanged between the parties, but excluded from the patent list agreed to during negotiations or from 
 
-25- 
 
 the lists that were exchanged as a result of the parties failure to reach an agreement. Both parties must reasonably cooperate to expedite discovery as is needed in connection with the PI motion. 
 The BPCIA limits both the reference product sponsor and the biosimilar applicant from bringing actions for declaratory judgment (DJ). In particular, if the reference product sponsor has been provided confidential access to the biosimilar application, neither party may bring a DJ action before the reference product sponsor receives the applicants 180 day advance notice of commercial marketing. Moreover, DJ actions may only be brought against patents for which a PI motion has been filed. Importantly, if the biosimilar applicant fails to respond to the reference product sponsor as required at the various steps of the BPCIAs patent dispute resolution framework, the reference product sponsor may bring a DJ action on any patent included on the reference product sponsors initial list and its list of newly issued or licensed patents. If the applicant fails to provide access to the confidential information required to be provided at the start of the patent dispute process, the reference product sponsor may bring a DJ action on any patent that claims the biological product or its use. 
 The FDA has approved four applications submitted under the 351(k) pathway through December 31, 2016: Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz) on March 6, 2015, Inflectra (infliximab-dyyb) on April 5, 2016, Erelzi (etanercept-szzs) on August 30, 2016 and Amjevita (adalimumab-atto) on September 23, 2016. Thus, no typical review period for a biosimilar application has yet been established. However, the FDA aims to review 70%, 80%, 85%, and 90% of original (rather than resubmitted) biosimilar applications within ten months of receipt in fiscal years 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 respectively. The FDA did complete review of the Zarxio application within 10 months of a BLA filing (May 8, 2014). While it may be possible for a biosimilar applicant and reference product sponsor to settle any patent disputes prior to approval, patent litigation may delay the ability of a biosimilar applicant to sell commercial product in the United States, as was the case with Zarxio, which was launched in September 2015. 
 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications 
 The provisions of Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA were created, in part, to help avoid unnecessary duplication of studies already performed on a previously approved (reference or listed) drug; the section gives the FDA express permission to rely on data not developed by the NDA applicant. Indeed, a new drug application filed under Section 505(b)(2) is one for which one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant for approval were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. We are pursuing a Section 505(b)(2) regulatory strategy for our PF708 product candidate and we plan to reference the Forteo (teriparatide) listed drug which is marketed by Eli Lilly for the treatment of osteoporosis. 
 The owner of an NDA for a branded drug product may list with the FDA certain patents whose claims allegedly cover the applicants branded product. Each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any applicant who files a 505(b)(2) new drug application referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that: (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA, referred to as a Paragraph I Certification; (2) such patent has expired, referred to as a Paragraph II Certification; (3) the date on which such patent expires, referred to as a Paragraph III Certification; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted, referred to as a Paragraph IV Certification. The applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain, or carves out, any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. An applicant submitting a Paragraph IV Certification must provide notice to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved branded drug to which the 505(b)(2) application refers. If the reference branded drug holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the Paragraph IV Certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the Paragraph IV Certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. 
 
-26- 
 
Additionally, a 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the NDA branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below. Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FFDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for a reference listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve another drug application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substances physiological or pharmacologic action. During the five-year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing any application for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDAs findings regarding that drug; the FDA may accept an application for filing after four years if the follow-on applicant makes a Paragraph IV Certification. A drug may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical trials, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted or sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA that references such product until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the entire exclusivity period. 
 Patent Term Restoration 
 Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the products approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA. 
The Animal Rule 
 In the case of product candidates that are intended to treat certain rare life-threatening diseases, such as our anthrax vaccine product candidates, conducting controlled clinical trials to determine efficacy may be unethical or unfeasible. Under regulations issued by the FDA in 2015, often referred to as the Animal Rule, the approval of such products can be based on clinical data from trials in healthy human subjects that demonstrate adequate safety and efficacy data from adequate and well-controlled animal studies. Among other requirements, the animal studies must establish that the drug or biological product is reasonably likely to produce clinical benefits in humans. Because the FDA must agree that data derived from animal studies may be extrapolated to establish safety and effectiveness in humans, seeking approval under the Animal Rule may add significant time, complexity and uncertainty to the testing and approval process. In addition, products approved under the Animal Rule are subject to additional requirements including post-marketing study requirements, restrictions imposed on marketing or distribution or requirements to provide information to patients.

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payors decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. 
 The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of therapeutic equivalent products for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, Affordable Care Act, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased the minimum rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, established mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies share of sales to federal health care programs. Furthermore, the current presidential administration and Congress are also expected to attempt broad sweeping changes to the current health care laws. We face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. The impact of those changes on us and potential effect on biosimilar manufacturers as a whole is currently unknown. But, any changes to the Affordable Care Act are likely to have an impact on our results of operations, and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulations in the United States may have on our business. 
 In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
 
-28- 
 
The marketability of any products for which we and our collaboration partners receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States and other countries has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 If we and our collaboration partners obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: 

 | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, that requires drug manufacturers to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | State law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industrys voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our future business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, the Affordable Care Act broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the 
 
-29- 
 
 Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act, or FCA, (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute. 
 We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Safeguards we implement to discourage improper payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants, and others may be ineffective, and violations of the FCPA and similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against us, any of which would likely harm our reputation, business, financial condition and result of operations. 
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid and imprisonment, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
 Hazardous Materials 
 Our research and development processes may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. We cannot predict how changes in laws or development of new regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance. 
Competition 
 The development and commercialization of protein therapeutics is highly competitive. While we believe that our Pfēnex Expression Technology®, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, generic pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In the event that we and our collaboration partners were to market and sell any of our biopharmaceutical products, we would face competition from the companies producing branded reference drugs, as well as any other firms developing the biosimilars that would compete with the product candidates in our pipeline and other novel products with similar indications. For example, PF582 may compete with products by Roche, as the reference product sponsor, Sandoz International GmbH, or Sandoz, a subsidiary of Novartis AG, Formycon AG, and bioeq GmbH as biosimilar companies and Ophthotech Corporation as a developer of novel products. Additionally, PF582 and Lucentis compete with globally marketed products including Eylea and Avastin (off label). Similarly, PF708, our teriparatide 505(b)(2) candidate, may face competition from the reference product sponsor, Eli Lilly, or other competition from companies like Teva and Gedeon Richter Plc., and from Amgen Inc. and Radius Health, Inc. as developers of novel products. Key competitive factors affecting the success of our lead product candidates, if approved, are likely to be price, the level of biosimilar, therapeutic equivalent and novel product competition and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Similarly, our novel vaccine development programs face substantial competition from major pharmaceutical and other biotechnology companies that are actively working on improved and novel vaccines. We believe that our primary competitors include Emergent BioSolutions, Inc. and Altimmune, Inc. These companies are receiving funding from BARDA for the development of next generation anthrax vaccines. All of our novel vaccine efforts will face competition for limited government funding from other non-vaccine defensive measures as well, including medical countermeasures for biological, chemical and nuclear threats, diagnostic testing systems and other emergency preparedness countermeasures. 
 Further, many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and 
 
-30- 
 
 development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we are in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors treatments may be more effective or more effectively marketed and sold than any treatment we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. 
 Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and subject registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 To date, none of our product candidates have completed clinical development, been submitted for regulatory review or received marketing authorization from any regulatory agency, and therefore we have not received revenue from the sale of any of our product candidates. 
 In light of our stage of development, we have not yet established commercial organization or distribution capabilities. Except for our agreements with Jazz and Strides Arcolab with respect to certain product candidates, we generally expect to retain commercial rights for our product candidates. In particular, we intend to use an internal sales force to commercialize products for which we may receive marketing approvals in territories in which we believe it is possible to access the market through a focused, specialty sales force. 
 Upon marketing approval, Jazz, our collaboration partner, will assume responsibility for the manufacturing and commercialization of certain hematology products globally. For products being developed as part of our joint venture with Strides Arcolab, we have joint responsibility for worldwide commercialization. Given the initial emerging markets focus for those products, we generally expect to jointly seek collaboration, distribution and/or marketing arrangements with third parties. 
 We have sales and marketing capabilities to support our commercial efforts for our protein production services and reagent protein product sales. In addition, we have sales and marketing capabilities to support those products under development that receive FDA approval that will ultimately be procured by the United States government. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, and seek to obtain and maintain patents for any patentable aspects of our platform technology and our products or product candidates, their methods of use and any other inventions that are important to the development of our business. Our success depends substantially on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology and product candidates, to defend and enforce our patents to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing United States and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology and product candidates that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position relating to our platform technology and product candidates. 
 
-31- 
 
We are the owner or licensee of a portfolio of patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets which protect various aspects of our business. As of December 31, 2016, we were the sole owner of a patent portfolio that consisted of a total of 18 U.S. issued patents and six U.S. pending patent applications that provide material coverage for our platform technology and our lead product candidates as well as foreign granted and pending patent applications which are counterparts to certain of the foregoing U.S. patents and patent applications. Our U.S. issued patents expire during the time period beginning in 2025 and ending in 2033. Our owned and exclusively licensed patent portfolio includes claims directed to: 
 

 | methods for bacterial protein production and methods for rapid screening of an array of expression systems
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | P. fluorescens promoter sequences and secretion leader sequences
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | auxotrophic marker systems for antibiotic free maintenance of expression plasmids in high cell density cultures,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | improved incorporation of non-natural amino acids
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | expression of classes of proteins such as cytokines
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | antibody derivatives
--+---------------------


 | microbial toxins in P. fluorescens
--+-----------------------------------


 | methods and expression strains for production and/or purification of soluble full length human cytokines, Interferon beta and G-CSF
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | vaccine antigens recombinant anthrax protective antigen, microbial toxins and toxoids, and the malarial vaccine candidate antigen P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | fusion partners for peptide production
--+---------------------------------------

 Pursuant to the technology licensing agreement, The Dow Chemical Company, or TDCC, and Dow Global Technologies LLC, or DGTI, also grant to us non-exclusive licenses to U.S. patents and applications and their foreign counterparts covering methods and technologies for recovery of proteins and peptides from P. fluorescens cells. In conjunction with the licenses granted by TDCC and DGTI to us under the technology licensing agreement, we also entered into a grant-back and technology license agreement, pursuant to which we granted to TDCC exclusive and non-exclusive licenses under certain patent rights and know-how relating to our Pfēnex Expression Technology® to use certain biological materials to make, use and commercialize products in certain fields of use that do not include human therapeutics. See BusinessCollaborations, Joint Development and Licenses for a detailed description of our agreements with TDCC and DGTI. 
 The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to obtain and maintain our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining issued claims that cover our technology and product candidates, and being able to enforce those claims against our competitors once granted. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice the patented technology in relation to the commercialization of our product candidates. Third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our patented products and practicing our patented technology. Our issued patents and those that may be issued in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our products. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. For these reasons, we may have competition for both our biosimilar and vaccine products. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or 
 
-32- 
 
 remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. 
 We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology and processes, please see Risk FactorsRisks related to our intellectual property. 
 Environmental Matters 
 Our research and development and manufacturing activities and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials owned by us, including, small quantities of acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, ethidium bromide and compressed gases, and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our and our manufacturers facilities pending their use and disposal. We seek to comply with applicable laws regarding the handling and disposal of such materials. Given the small volume of such materials used or generated at our facilities, we do not expect our compliance efforts to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position. However, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. We do not currently maintain separate environmental liability coverage and any such contamination or discharge could result in significant cost to us in penalties, damages, and suspension of our operations. 
Suppliers 
 We currently rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, contract manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of our product candidates for use in our clinical trials. In addition, we intend to rely on third parties to manufacture any products that we may commercialize in the future. We have established an internal pharmaceutical development group to develop manufacturing methods for our product candidates, to optimize manufacturing processes, and to select and transfer these manufacturing technologies to our suppliers. We contract with multiple manufacturers to ensure adequate product supply and to mitigate risk. 
 There currently are a limited number of these manufacturers. Furthermore, some of the contract manufacturers that we have identified to date only have limited experience at manufacturing, formulating, analyzing and packaging our product candidates in quantities sufficient for conducting clinical trials or for commercialization. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate facilities for cGMP manufacturing of any products. Although we intend to rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with experience in the development of United States and European Union cGMP-compliant processes and management of Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMOs), to oversee the technology transfer to the manufacturers of PF708, PF582, Px563L, Px533 and future product 
 
-33- 
 
 candidates that we may develop. Our manufacturing processes employ standard equipment common to CMOs. Our processes also use common and widely available materials, and our well-established manufacturing procedures are robust, scalable, and readily transferable to support our clinical development programs and commercialization of our products. We believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our clinical and commercial requirements, although we cannot be certain that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources, if necessary, would not result in significant delay or material additional costs. For a discussion of risks related to our sources and availability of supplies, see Risk FactorsRisks Relating to our Reliance on Third Parties  We rely on third-party suppliers, and in some instances a single third-party supplier, for the manufacture and supply of certain materials in our protein production services, and these suppliers could cease to manufacture the materials, go out of business or otherwise not perform as anticipated.
In each of our agreements with contract manufacturers, we retain ownership of our intellectual property and generally own and/or are assigned ownership of processes, developments, data, results and other intellectual property generated during the course of the performance of each agreement that primarily relate to our products. Where applicable, we are granted non-exclusive licenses to certain contract manufacturer intellectual property for purposes of exploiting the products that are the subject of the agreement, and in a few instances we grant non-exclusive licenses to the contract manufacturers for use outside of our product area. In each contract, we have the right to terminate for convenience. The agreements also contain typical provisions for both parties to terminate for material breach, and bankruptcy and insolvency. 
 PF582. In December 2016, we entered into a contract manufacturing agreement for the cGMP manufacturing of PF582. 
 Px563L. In July 2015, we entered into a contract manufacturing agreement for the cGMP fill and finish of Px563L drug product for use in the Phase 1a clinical trial that was initiated in December 2015. All manufacturing costs are funded by BARDA, pursuant to the contract awarded to us in August 2015. 
 Protein Production 
 Utilizing our Pfēnex Expression Technology®, we provide protein production and process development services to third parties on a fee for service basis in support of the development of novel biopharmaceuticals. Pursuant to a license agreement, the third-party licenses a production strain from us and then pays us an up-front payment, milestone payments based upon clinical progression and regulatory filings, and a royalty based on product net sales. Our protein production efforts enable us to maximize the utilization of our Pfēnex Expression Technology®, expand our institutional knowledge and generate revenue. 
 Seasonality 
 Our revenues are not seasonal in nature. 
 U.S. Government Contracts 
 Revenue from U.S. Government contracts varies by year. A portion of our government business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. Government. In addition to contract terms, we must comply with procurement laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to the termination of contracts at the election of the government or the suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting. U.S. Government revenue as a percentage of our total revenue was approximately 10%, 48% and 74% for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For further discussion of risks related to government contracting, see the discussion in Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Form 10-K. 
 
-34- 
 
Employees 
 We believe that our success will depend greatly on our ability to identify, attract and retain capable employees. As of December 31, 2016, we had 63 employees, including a total of 16 employees who hold M.D. and/or Ph.D. degrees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit, and we believe our relations with our employees are good. 
Backlog 
 We have no material backlog of orders. 
 Research and Development 
 Over the last three fiscal years, we have invested over $54.7 million in principal research and development programs ($32.4 million, $18.2 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively). Please see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to research and development expenditures. 
 Geographic Information 
 During 2016, substantially all of our long-lived assets were located within the United States. With the exception of $0.1 million of long-lived assets held by a third-party vendor in India for manufacturing purposes, during 2015 all of our long-lived assets were located within the United States. During 2014, all of our long-lived assets were located within the United States. Approximately 9% of our revenue for 2016, 12% of our 2015 revenue, and 18% of our 2014 revenue came from international markets. Please see Note 1 to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our U.S. and non-U.S. revenue.
