Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are the leading provider of cloud-based business management software for the wellness services industry and a growing consumer brand, with more than 60,000 local business subscribers on our platform in more than 130 countries and territories. These subscribers provide a variety of wellness services to over 30 million active consumers as of December 31, 2016. Our integrated software and payments platform helps business owners in the wellness services industry run, market and build their businesses. We also help consumers more easily discover, evaluate, engage and transact with these businesses via the web, social sites and mobile devices.
Our Vision
Our vision is to leverage technology to improve the wellness of the world.
The MINDBODY Solution
Our integrated cloud-based business management software and payments platform is specifically designed to engage both the supply and demand sides of the wellness services industry.  Wellness encompasses multiple dimensions of a person’s well-being – physical, emotional, social, occupational and spiritual, among others.  As a result, we include health and fitness, integrative health, salon and spa, fine arts and children’s activities as categories within the wellness services industry.
Integrated Software and Payments Platform
Our platform is continuously evolving to help our subscribers simplify the way they run their businesses, attract, engage and retain more consumers, increase their revenues, and focus more on what they love to do – improving people’s lives.  We have developed this platform with powerful functionality that addresses key aspects of operating a wellness business, including:

• | Client Scheduling and Online Booking. Our subscribers can give their consumers the opportunity to book their next visit wherever and whenever it is most convenient, whether through subscribers’ websites, social media pages, or mobile applications like the MINDBODY app or the subscribers' own custom branded app. We offer robust features that enable all four different types of scheduling that wellness businesses typically encounter: 


◦ | Appointments. One-on-one appointments typically require preparation time before the appointment as well as off-boarding time after the appointment. Our software can manage practitioner availability as well as gaps between appointments in a time-efficient manner. 


◦ | Open classes. Open classes offer reserved or drop-in attendance on a first-come, first-served basis. Our software can transact at different price points, send automatic check-in and cancellation confirmations, and manage waitlists to optimize capacity utilization. 


◦ | Enrollments and workshops. Enrollments and workshops are pre-registered events or series of classes with the same group of attendees. Our software offers the ability to set separate pricing outside of pre-paid packages and track absences, make-ups and various payment plans. 


◦ | Resource scheduling. To effectively manage their day-to-day business, wellness service providers need to manage and allocate their equipment and facilities. Our software can easily track, manage and allocate equipment and facilities for the classes and services these businesses provide. 


• | Staff Management. With our staff and resource scheduling software features, subscribers can keep their entire staff schedule in one place, allowing them to manage staff availability, hours, substitutions, commissions and other compensation, all of which can be easily linked to payroll records. 


◦ | Staff Tracking. Subscribers can assign tasks, follow up and send notifications via the staff dashboard. By giving each staff member a unique login, subscribers can allow staff members to update their own availability on a single, unified schedule. Moreover, subscribers can have staff clock in and out through our platform so their work hours and gross wages can be tracked automatically. In addition, variable compensation including compensation based on classes and appointments delivered, or sales commissions earned, can be managed through our platform. 

2


◦ | Payroll. Subscribers have the ability to set compensation rates per class, per appointment, per hour, or as a percentage of consumer payment for each individual staff member, as well as track and add gratuities earned into the payroll report. Additionally, subscribers can offer commissions to their staff for retail sales or promotions. Payroll is calculated automatically and exported to any of several popular payroll service formats, including ADP, Paychex and Exact Payroll Services. 


• | Client Relationship Management. With our client relationship management features, subscribers have all of their consumer information in one place and can take advantage of powerful consumer relationship and marketing tools. Subscribers can securely store their consumers’ personal information in a unique profile and manage account, visit and purchase history for more effective service. Our platform also helps subscribers target new consumers, keep in touch with loyal members, and offer variable, targeted promotions and discounts. 


◦ | Client Tracking. Subscribers can maintain a comprehensive client profile, including contact information, photos, birthdays, preferences, purchase and visit histories, payment information and future schedules. Subscribers can also track the sales cycle and conversion of prospective clients. Clients can create and manage their own accounts with their preferred service providers, allowing them to browse products and services and make purchases from mobile devices and the web. 


◦ | The MINDBODY Network. Subscribers can opt in to this fee-based marketing platform (formerly the Marketing Platform) to feature their introductory offers (typically valid for a single-purchase) on the MINDBODY app and/or feature their services through third-party partner applications or websites, expanding their online presence to reach more prospective customers. 


◦ | Email Marketing. Subscribers can utilize our platform to send broad or targeted email marketing campaigns. They also have the option to sync to a third-party account with our platform, and create email lists that update automatically whenever client contact information changes in their site. 


◦ | Loyalty Programs. To reward consumers, subscribers can build a point-based client loyalty program, and set point values and minimum redemption requirements. 


◦ | Promotions. Subscribers can set up promotions to attract new consumers and give current ones an incentive to try something new. 


◦ | Automation. Subscribers can send automated text message alerts, push notifications and reminders to consumers about upcoming classes, appointments and more. Further automation examples include sending purchase receipts directly to consumers’ email addresses, receiving notifications when consumers book, confirm or cancel appointments, tracking online orders as they come in, and printing packing slips automatically as well as printing sign-in sheets for class, or using a tablet to set up a self-check-in station. 


◦ | Memberships. Subscribers can manage membership contracts and waivers, collect membership fees automatically through recurring payments, offer special discounts for products and services as well as create membership tiers to extend rewards and perks to their most loyal consumers. 


• | Integrated Payment Processing. We offer our subscribers integrated payment processing solutions with our software at competitive rates. The integration between point-of-sale and payment processing saves our subscribers time by eliminating the need for error-prone manual reconciliations. In addition, our integrated payments platform allows for convenient and secure storage of consumer credit card information, which allows for seamless online bookings, recurring membership payments through our business management software and online store purchases through our subscribers’ websites, the MINDBODY app or third-party partner sites included in the MINDBODY Network. 


• | Retail Point-of-Sale. Our point-of-sale capabilities help subscribers sell products and services, contracts and memberships, packages, workshops and store-branded gift cards. Our point-of-sale feature tracks product inventory levels and automatically issues purchase orders when product levels reach a re-order point. In addition, our point-of-sale capabilities can be used to track the cost of goods sold and gross margin for various products. 

3


◦ | Purchase Tracking. Subscribers can sell products and services as well as memberships, monthly contracts and packages that combine products and services at their place of business and online. Subscribers can securely store consumer billing information to facilitate quicker transactions. Payments for classes or appointments can be applied before or after consumer check-in, and before or after the session is complete. Our point-of-sale functionality allows the assignment of staff commissions to appropriate parties. 


◦ | Inventory. Subscribers can set inventory re-order points, automatically generate purchase orders and easily log arriving inventory. As a result, subscribers can more efficiently manage availability, calculate gross margin and monitor inventory shrinkage, among other benefits. 


◦ | Payments. Subscribers can accept several types of cash or non-cash equivalent payment methods, including ACH, debit and credit cards. They can also set up payment plans and schedule recurring payments automatically from securely stored credit cards on file. Our payments platform provides instant authorization and nightly settlement of credit card, debit card and ACH transactions. Once a sale is complete, staff can void, edit or return the sale, and all of these changes are recorded in an auditable fashion. All consumer payment information is protected behind PCI Level I Data Security Standards, the most rigorous credit card certification standard available. 


• | Analytics and Reporting. We track key information that helps subscribers achieve their business goals, including revenue growth, contribution margin of classes, consumer retention rates, referral sources, return on investment for consumer retention campaigns and practitioner performance based on consumer loyalty and reviews by class or type of service. Our platform also generates reports that help our subscribers allocate their resources, set budgets and measure their performance against goals. Subscribers are empowered to identify trends and opportunities for improvement in their businesses by leveraging the following analytics and marketing tools: 


◦ | Last Visit and No Return. Subscribers can pull the list of consumers who have not come back to the business for a given period of time designated by the subscriber. 


◦ | Best Sellers. Subscribers can view best-selling products and services, as well as profit margins. 


◦ | Cancellations and No Shows. Subscribers can check which consumers cancel or do not arrive for a scheduled visit, charge cancellation fees, or suspend consumer scheduling privileges. 


◦ | Referral Sources. Subscribers can gain valuable insights into their most effective marketing channels for attracting new consumers. 


◦ | Sales Forecast. Subscribers can forecast future sales revenue based on current prospects. 


◦ | Attendance with Revenue. Subscribers can break down revenue by each client visit, staff person, type of service and date. 


◦ | Attendance Analysis. Subscribers can compare consumer attendance levels across hours in a day as well as days in a week. 


◦ | Gross Margin. Subscribers can see the gross margin for each product and service. 


◦ | Promotions. Subscribers can tie every redeemed promotion code back to the client who used it, or analyze the overall success of any promotion effort. 


◦ | Account Balances. Subscribers can make account balance inquiries for any given consumer, and create a statement for consumers with negative balances. 


◦ | Retention. Subscribers can check client retention rate overall, or by individual staff member. 


◦ | Memberships and New Members. Subscribers can monitor consumer membership activity including new, renewing, canceling, active and inactive members as well as revenue associated with types of members. 


◦ | Commission. Subscribers can manage commissions earned by and payable to their staff. 


◦ | Transactions. Subscribers can sort all past transactions by what has settled, or is pending, voided, and returned. 

4


◦ | Client Acquisition Dashboard. At a glance, subscribers can attribute new consumers to various acquisition channels. Subscribers can track purchases made by these new consumers and how much revenue each consumer has generated since that first purchase. Subscribers can also track which consumers purchased specific intro offers as well as the reviews generated about their business in the MINDBODY app. 


• | Simple and Intuitive User Experience. We designed our business management software with a focus on developing a visually appealing interface that is simple, easy to use and meets the demands our subscribers have for modern web and mobile applications. Because we focus on a simple and intuitive user experience, our software platform requires little training and is easy to adopt for users across the entire organization, an important feature given the high employee turnover in the wellness services industry. At the same time, the intuitive interface of our platform is supported by complex underlying technology that powers efficient business management. 


• | Branded web. Our branded web solution (formerly HealCode) gives our subscribers the ability to embed their MINDBODY class and appointment schedules within their web and social sites, creating a seamless and branded online experience for their customers. 


• | Mobility. Our platform enables our subscribers to manage their operations anytime and anywhere via a number of mobile devices and operating systems, including Mac, iOS, Android and Windows. 


◦ | MINDBODY Express. MINDBODY Express is our native business-subscriber facing mobile app that enhances our core offering by allowing our subscribers to easily run their business, book consumers and sell products and services while on the go. 


◦ | Branded Mobile App. Our branded mobile app offering (formerly MINDBODY Engage) allows our subscribers to have their own native apps to create a unique branded experience for their consumers. 


◦ | MINDBODY Class Check-In. The MINDBODY Class Check-In app helps our subscribers create a better consumer experience at the front desk. Consumers can check themselves into class, freeing up front desk staff to help others and making it possible for instructors to start classes faster. 


• | Social Integration. Our platform integrates with popular social networks like Facebook and Twitter. As an example, our platform allows our subscribers to publish schedules on their Facebook page, enabling consumers to directly book appointments and classes with them via Facebook. 


• | Dynamic Cloud-Based Architecture. Our software platform is powered by a dynamic cloud-based architecture that allows our subscribers to manage their operations as efficiently as possible, while requiring low upfront investment and no maintenance. This architecture allows for automatic software updates and rapid launch of new product features while also allowing our platform to easily scale with subscribers as their businesses grow. 


• | Open Platform for Third-Party Application Development. We have built an open and extensible platform with an application programming interface, or API, that offers developers access to our inventory of classes, payments and scheduling capabilities. Approved developers can pull information from and post data to our platform and use that capability to create a variety of unique applications with custom interfaces. 


• | Integration with Other Cloud-based Partners. Our platform can be integrated with other cloud-based software that our subscribers may be using for critical business management tasks to extend the capabilities of our platform within a variety of focus areas such as automation, marketing, accounting, mobile and social. 


• | Security and Compliance. We have consistently passed our Level I Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS, audits, indicating our compliance with the most rigorous level of credit card security standard available. In addition, we, in certain instances, collect, access, use, maintain and/or transmit protected health information in connection with providing services to subscribers who are subject to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA. Our platform is engineered to provide high reliability and availability. We continually monitor our infrastructure for any sign of failure or pending failure and we take preemptive action to minimize or prevent downtime. We maintain the reliability of our service by utilizing redundant network infrastructure, clusters that tolerate failure of individual nodes, and deploying high availability server pairs. We also implement various disaster recovery measures, including full replication of hardware and data in our geographically distinct data centers, to minimize data loss in the event of a data center disaster.

The MINDBODY App  
The MINDBODY app is our consumer-facing mobile app that lets consumers have a unified account with a single login to manage all aspects of their wellness activities with multiple MINDBODY subscribers.  Consumers can discover local wellness services using a geo-located map function, view class and appointment descriptions, schedules and real-time availability, read practitioner biographies and user reviews written by consumers who have actually received the service, and then book and pay for their desired services in a few taps from their mobile devices.  Through the app, consumers can also receive appointment reminders and check in to classes before they arrive, receive real-time updates regarding changes in class schedules and access their account profile to review their class visit and payment history. The MINDBODY app also surfaces our subscribers’ introductory offers through a recommendation engine that considers a user’s prior history and preferences, and uses their location to make targeted recommendations.
The MINDBODY Network
The MINDBODY Network is a fee-based marketing platform that connects our subscribers with local consumers via the MINDBODY app and third-party partner applications or websites. Subscribers who opt in to the MINDBODY Network receive greater exposure through additional promotion of their intro offers or deals on various screens throughout the MINDBODY app, as well as featured placement on third-party partner apps and/or websites.  
MINDBODY API Platform and Partner Ecosystem
We have enabled a rich partner ecosystem that extends the value of our software and payments platform in powerful ways.  Our partners have built applications that supplement our capabilities in areas such as marketing automation, accounting, loyalty, mobile and social interactions.  Several of these partners have created significant consumer-facing businesses that rely on our unique inventory of classes, scheduling and payments capabilities.  All of this is enabled by our APIs, to which we grant access to approved developers and partners.  We also integrate with partners that provide email marketing, customer survey, events management and other functionality to augment the capabilities of our platform for the benefit of our subscribers.

Software Subscription Levels
Because each of our subscribers is unique and at a different stage of their respective professional journey, our software subscriptions are provided on a tiered pricing model based upon different software functionality levels—Starter, Pro, Accelerate and Ultimate.  Each of these levels has been carefully crafted to meet our subscribers’ differing needs and levels of complexity, giving them appropriate functionality to optimize their business.  
Subscriber Services and Support
We have multiple teams within our customer support organization dedicated to maintaining a high level of subscriber satisfaction, including onboarding, data conversion and import, direct technical support, self-service, client care and client success.  Our operations are structured with the subscriber experience in mind, and we strive to create a smooth process for our subscribers.  We believe that providing a premium level of support to our subscribers is critical to enhancing our brand as a superior provider of business management software for the wellness services industry.

• | Subscriber Onboarding. We typically board new subscribers with live training sessions delivered via telephone and web conference. These trainings are supplemented by self-service setup checklists, online help materials and webinars. 


• | Ongoing Subscriber Support. Inclusive with our base subscription fees, we offer 24/7 customer service and support via phone, chat, emails, and self-help knowledge centers. All customer service and support is provided by our in-house personnel who are invested in MINDBODY’s core values and closely connected to our Product, Technology and Experience team. We have not outsourced our customer service. 


• | Professional Services. Our premium support services enable subscribers to access dedicated, advanced product and business operations support from software and business experts. This service is usually chosen by our higher-end small businesses and multi-location chains or franchises.

• | MINDBODY University. MINDBODY University is a multi-day advanced subscriber education event held multiple times per year in various destination locations around the world (e.g., London, New York, San Diego and Sydney). This high-impact business conference teaches advanced software skills and best business practices that help subscribers increase revenues and improve their bottom line. In addition, for a monthly fee (included with the Ultimate software tier), subscribers have unlimited, online access to recorded business management material derived from our MINDBODY University courses. 


• | BOLD Conference. We provide our subscribers with a two-day annual user conference where they can learn best business practices and participate in networking opportunities designed to help fuel their business growth and success. Program sessions typically include key topics needed to thrive within the competitive wellness industry market – from the latest trends in consumer marketing and social media, to selling strategies and strategic business partnerships – taught by MINDBODY team members, industry experts and fellow MINDBODY subscribers. 


• | Hardware & Merchandise. We offer point-of-sale hardware, such as cash drawers, receipt printers and bar code scanners, as well as branded key chain tags and gift cards our subscribers may require. We also offer smartphone and tablet credit card readers. 

Key Benefits to MINDBODY’s Constituents
Benefits to subscribers and wellness practitioners:

• | Simplified Operations. Our business management software and payments platform allows subscribers and practitioners to streamline and simplify their operations. MINDBODY automates a large number of time-consuming workflows, thus reducing the administrative effort and time subscribers and their employees need to invest in business operations. 


• | Greater Focus on Clients. By simplifying the operations of wellness businesses, we enable subscribers and practitioners to focus on their clients. In addition, our analytical tools provide critical insights that help subscribers focus on optimizing their business and achieving their goals. 


• | Increased Growth in Client Base and Revenue. We help our subscribers increase their consumer base by taking advantage of a free listing on the MINDBODY app, making them visible to a larger pool of consumers. Subscribers who choose to opt in to the fee-based MINDBODY Network receive greater exposure through additional promotion of their introductory offers or deals on various screens throughout the app, as well as featured placement on third-party partner apps and/or websites. Moreover, by having the ability to send reminders, promotions and special offers via email, text, push or in-app notifications to consumers based on a record of their past interactions, subscribers can increase their consumer engagement and loyalty. We also help subscribers sell their products and services through a variety of channels – an online store, their website, social sites, or the MINDBODY Network, thus helping them to increase their revenue opportunities. 

Benefits to consumers:

• | Convenient Single Interface for a Variety of Wellness Services. We offer consumers a single platform to discover, evaluate and book wellness services. Our subscribers include a large variety of wellness businesses such as fitness studios, yoga, Pilates, massage, salons, and spas. We provide convenient “one-stop-shop” access to our subscribers’ wellness services through a variety of interfaces, including subscriber websites, social media sites, and branded apps, as well as searchable platforms like the MINDBODY app and third-party sites. In addition, reviews on our platform can only be written by consumers who have actually participated in a class or used a service. As a result, consumers are able to access credible reviews that provide a basis for informed decisions. 


• | Time Savings and a Higher Engagement in Wellness Activities. We believe that our platform saves consumers time that would otherwise be required to perform online searches, browse through numerous websites and make phone calls to schedule or manage their desired wellness services. We also believe that our ability to allow consumers to more easily manage their wellness routine and consume more wellness services on a regular basis, increases their engagement in wellness activities. 


• | Ability to Track Personal Health Data with Each Wellness Activity. New technologies, including third-party wearable fitness trackers, and mobile apps within the health and fitness category, enable consumers to track various aspects of their health and fitness. As part of this trend, the MINDBODY app offers consumers the ability to track their personal health data, and to monitor the effectiveness of their wellness activities. With the MINDBODY app, consumers can access their wellness activity history, such as class attendance frequency and class duration, as well as personal activity data tracked by integrated wearable devices.

Competition
The market for business management software and payments solutions for wellness businesses is highly competitive, fragmented and rapidly evolving due to technological innovations.  We believe our competitors fall into the following primary categories:

• | On-premise software providers and small cloud-based providers that typically focus on a specific vertical within the wellness services industry;


• | Cloud-based software providers that offer generic scheduling tools with minimal customization by vertical; and


• | Payments services providers that offer basic scheduling tools.

In addition, for some small to medium-sized organizations, we compete with basic productivity tools that these organizations have adapted for scheduling and business management uses, including desktop applications (e.g., Microsoft Office, Google Docs), pen and paper, and spreadsheet tools for tracking and management purposes. 
The principal competitive factors in our market include:

• | Industry expertise


• | Depth of product functionality and ease of use


• | Brand recognition and reputation


• | Ability to drive consumer demand via a large and rapidly growing consumer network


• | 24/7 customer service


• | Price, especially for entry-level products


• | Product extensibility via APIs


• | Partnerships and integrations with major consumer brands


• | Integration with mobile devices


• | Payment processing integration


• | Marketing capabilities and analytics


• | Strong company culture


• | Security and reliability


• | Global presence

We believe that we compete favorably on the factors described above.  However, some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name recognition and larger sales and marketing budget; therefore, we may not always compare favorably with respect to some or all of the factors above.
Our Technology
We have developed our proprietary technology platform over the last decade, with a focus on delivering industry-leading breadth and flexibility of functionality.  Our platform is built API-first with a service-oriented multi-tenant architecture, making it fully extensible to our business and consumer web and mobile applications, as well as complementary technology partner integrations.  Maintaining the integrity and security of our technology platform is mission critical to our business and our subscribers’ success.

• | Reliable. Our platform is engineered to provide high reliability and availability. Our agreements with subscribers typically provide for a limited warranty relating to service level commitments. In certain circumstances, our subscribers may be eligible for credits if we are unable to meet these service level commitments. Our infrastructure is hosted in two dual redundant Tier 4 (the highest rating available) data centers separately located in North America. Our network operations center provides 24/7 monitoring of hundreds of sensors on all systems, including global synthetic and real user monitoring to ensure we have complete visibility into our platform and are able to instantly respond to any potential service issue. 


• | Secure. Our platform hosts a large quantity of subscriber data and processes a large volume of business-to-consumer transactions. We therefore maintain a comprehensive security program designed to help safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our subscribers’ data, which includes both organizational and technical control measures. Our platform includes a host of third-party encryption, malware prevention, firewall and intrusion detection, data loss detection and patch management technologies to protect and maintain all systems. We routinely audit and review our security program. In addition, we regularly obtain third-party security audits of our technical operations and procedures covering data security to include the PCI-DSS, as well as Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16, or SSAE 16, and Service Organizations Controls 2, or SOC 2, Type I Attestation. 

9


• | Scalable. We have developed a robust and scalable platform that processes millions of queries per day. By leveraging best-in-breed technology components, server virtualization, and a service-oriented architecture, we believe we can seamlessly scale our compute and storage capacity. 

Our Subscribers
We have a diverse subscriber base with over 60,000 subscribers located in over 130 countries and territories across a variety of industries within the wellness services industry.  No single subscriber represented more than 10% of our total revenue in any of fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.  
Our Culture and Employees
Our company and employees share an exceptional corporate culture that is built upon a detailed set of core values that are reinforced throughout the company through new hire orientation, monthly corporate wellness initiatives and annual performance appraisals.  Our employees thrive in a nurturing environment that is driven by innovation, passion for health and wellness and dedication towards excellent subscriber experience.  
As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,350 employees.  None of our employees is represented by a labor organization or is a party to any collective bargaining arrangement.  We have never had a work stoppage, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Sales and Marketing
We deploy a direct sales approach driven by an outbound tele-sales team located primarily in San Luis Obispo, California with several regional offices throughout the United States, and locations in the United Kingdom and Australia.  Our sales team qualifies and manages prospective and current subscribers, aiming to initiate, retain, and expand their use of our platform over time.  Our sales team partners with sales operations specialists to provide consultation and product demonstration to prospects to accelerate the onboarding of new subscribers.
Our marketing efforts are focused on generating awareness of our platform, creating sales leads, establishing and promoting our brand, and cultivating a community of successful and vocal subscribers and consumers.  We utilize both online and offline marketing initiatives, including search engine and email marketing, online display and print advertising, participation in trade shows, events and conferences, permission marketing, social media and media outreach, and strategic partnerships and endorsements.
Our sales prospecting, lead qualification and lead development functions are performed by sales development representatives, and sales associates of which the majority work part-time schedules.  Our sales and marketing headcount as of December 31, 2016 was 493.  Our sales and marketing expenses were $56.5 million, $46.3 million and $30.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the ideation, research, design, development and testing of all aspects of our platform.  To create a roadmap that meets the needs of our subscribers, we emphasize collaboration during the development process.  Subscribers provide direct input through dialog with our customer support, product management, and user experience teams, as well as our community forum and feature utilization data.  We deploy new features, functionality, and technologies for our platform through monthly software releases or updates to minimize disruption and deliver continuous improvement.
As of December 31, 2016, we had 222 employees in our research and development organization, which is based primarily in San Luis Obispo, California.  Our research and development expenses were $30.3 million, $23.1 million, and $16.2 million, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, a variety of contractual arrangements, such as license agreements, assignment agreements, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, and confidentiality procedures and technical measures to gain rights to and protect the intellectual property used in our business.
10

We have also developed a patent program and a strategy to identify, apply for, and secure patents for innovative aspects of our platform and technology.  We have seven U.S. patent applications pending.  We also have six pending patent applications in jurisdictions outside of the United States.  We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective.
We actively pursue registration of our trademarks, logos, service marks, and domain names in the United States and in other key jurisdictions.  We are the registered holder of a variety of U.S. and international domain names that include the term MINDBODY and similar variations.  We use several trademarks or registered trademarks for our products and services, including “MINDBODY,” and several logos and images, such as the Enso logo, as well as the slogans “LOVE YOUR BUSINESS,” “BOOK YOUR BEST DAY. EVERY DAY." and "CONNECTING THE WORLD OF WELLNESS."
We also rely on certain intellectual property rights that we license from third parties, including under certain open source licenses.  Though such third-party technologies may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, we believe that alternative technologies would be available to us, if needed.
Our policy is to require employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf and agreeing to protect our confidential information.  All of our key employees and contractors have done so.  In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our vendors and subscribers.  We also control and monitor access to, and distribution of, our software, documentation, and other proprietary information.
Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours.
Some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosures of our products may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries.  In addition, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great of an extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States.  To the extent that we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and misappropriation of our proprietary information may increase.
We expect that software and other solutions in our industry may be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap.
Seasonality
We believe there are significant seasonal factors that may cause us to record higher revenue in some quarters compared with others.  We believe this variability is largely due to our focus on the wellness services industry, as many of our subscribers experience an increase in demand for their services in the first quarter of each year due to their consumers becoming more motivated to pursue health and fitness goals in the new year. However, this seasonality may not be fully evident in our historical business performance because of our significant growth. If our revenue growth rate slows, we expect that the seasonality in our business may become more pronounced and may cause our operating results to fluctuate in the future.
Segments
We have one operating and reporting segment consisting of various products and services that are all related to our integrated cloud-based business management software and payments platform for the wellness services industry. For our revenue, net loss and total assets, see our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on 10-K.
Geographic Information
Financial information about geographic areas is set forth in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a discussion of the risks attendant to foreign operations, see the information in Part 1, Item 1A: “Risk Factors” under the caption “Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.”

Government Regulation
Our business is subject to extensive, complex and rapidly changing federal and state laws and regulations.
HIPAA, Privacy and Data Security Regulations
In connection with providing online scheduling services for certain subscribers, we may be subject to specific compliance obligations under privacy and data security laws, including but not limited to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and similar state laws that govern the collection, use, protection, and disclosure of personally identifiable information.  HIPAA imposes specific requirements regarding data privacy and security on covered entities (providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses); business associates (entities that may perform services for covered entities, pursuant to which they may access personal information); and business associates’ subcontractors, including us.  We are therefore required to adopt certain practices and enter into certain contracts agreeing to protect personal information in specific ways.  There may be civil and criminal penalties, as well as contractual ramifications, for violating HIPAA.
Corporate Information
We were organized as a California limited liability company in February 2001 and converted into a California corporation in October 2004. We were reincorporated in Delaware in March 2015. Our principal executive offices are located at 4051 Broad Street, Suite 220, San Luis Obispo, California 93401, and our telephone number is (877) 755-4279. Our website address is https://www.mindbodyonline.com, and our investor relations website is investors.mindbodyonline.com.
