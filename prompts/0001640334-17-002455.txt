General Overview
 
We are an exploration stage company, incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 25, 2012, as a for-profit company, and electing a fiscal year end of June 30.
 
We are an exploration stage company with limited revenues and operating history. The mailing address of the principal executive offices is 17330 Preston Road, Suite 200D, Dallas, TX 75252. Our telephone number is (201) 730-6454.
 
We were incorporated to engage in the exploration and development of oil and gas properties. Our first lease was a 25% percent working interest and an 18.75% net revenue interest in 3 acres located in the Perkins Lease in Caddo Pine Island Field that lies in the northern part of Webster Parrish, Louisiana. Effective April 18, 2015 our company transferred its interest in the Perkins Oil Slack (Perkins No. 001, Serial No. 192865) to Indian Wells Investments of LA, LLC. 
 
Also in conjunction with the transfer in exchange for cancellation of outstanding debt of $8,475 our company agreed to pay Four Star Oil Company, Inc. $5,500. Our company is currently looking for a new well.
 
We received our initial funding of $20,001 through the sale of common stock to our former officer, J. Michael Page, who purchased 4,000,000 shares of our common stock at $0.005 per share on June 15, 2012. On February 1, 2013 our company issued a total of 750,000 shares of common stock to Mr. Page for cash in the amount of $0.01 per share for a total of $7,500. On March 15, 2014, we issued a total of 2,000,000 shares of common stock to various individuals for cash in the amount of $0.01 per share for a total of $20,000. These shares were issued pursuant to our company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1; the offering was closed on March 15, 2014. On June 20, 2014, in a private transaction and pursuant to a share transfer agreement between J. Michael Page and Howard H. Hendricks, Mr. Hendricks purchased 4,750,000 shares of common stock from J. Michael Page.

On May 13, 2016 in a private transaction and pursuant to a share transfer agreement between Howard H. Hendricks and Betty N. Myers, a director at the time, Mr. Hendricks transferred his 4,750,000 shares of common stock to Ms. Myers. 
 
On February 3, 2017 in a private transaction and pursuant to a share transfer agreement between Betty N. Meyers and Regale Consultants Ltd., Ms. Meyers transferred her 4,750,000 shares of common stock to Regale Consultants Ltd.
 
As of June 30, 2017 the Company had 6,750,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.
 
On July 17, 2017, the Company received $10,000, and issued a demand promissory note for $10,000. The promissory note is due on demand, and bears interest at 50% per annum.
 
From inception until the date of this filing we have had limited operating activities. Our financial statements from inception (May 25, 2012) through June 30, 2017 report $5,207 in revenue and a cumulative deficit of $133,131. Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion for Perkins Oil & Gas Inc. which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an Emerging Growth Company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.
 
We shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of:
 


a. | the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as such amount is indexed for inflation every 5 years by the Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, setting the threshold to the nearest 1,000,000) or more;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b. | the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective registration statement under this title; 
c. | the date on which such issuer has, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or

Smaller Reporting Company
 
Implications Of Being An Emerging Growth Company - The Jobs Act
 
We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the JOBS Act.
 An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:
 
 
· | A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related MD&A; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company’s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
· | Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive compensation arrangements; and 
· | No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. 

  
We may take advantage of the reduced reporting requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies even if we no longer qualify as an “emerging growth company.”
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have irrevocably opted out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the Act.
 
We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
 
Description Of Business
 
We are an exploration stage company with limited revenues and operating history. Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
We owned a 25% working interest and an 18.75% net revenue interest in a lease of three acres located in Webster Parrish, Louisiana, known as the Perkins Lease. Effective April 18, 2015 our company transferred its interest in the Perkins Oil Slack (Perkins No. 001, Serial No. 192865) to Indian Wells Investments of LA, LLC. Also in conjunction with the transfer in exchange for cancellation of outstanding debt of $8,475 our company agreed to pay Four Star Oil Company, Inc. $5,500. Our company is currently looking for a new well.
 
Our focus for the current fiscal year will be to pursue acquisition of additional leases and/or existing oil and gas wells which have potential for production, if revenues warrant.
 
Markets
 
The availability of a ready market and the prices obtained for produced oil depends on many factors, including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil, the proximity and capacity of pipelines and other transportation facilities, fluctuating demand, the marketing of competitive fuels, and the effects of governmental regulation on production and sales. A ready domestic market for oil exists because of the presence of pipelines for transport. The existence of an international market exists depends upon the presence of international delivery systems and political and pricing factors.
 
If we are successful in the continuing production of oil on a possible additional property, the target customers for our oil are expected to be refiners, remarketers and third party intermediaries, who either have, or have access to, consumer delivery systems. We intend to sell our oil under both short-term (less than one year) and long-term (one year or more) agreements at prices negotiated with third parties. Currently Spears Oil, a third party operator, picks up the oil and sells it to Shell Oil Company. The price is based upon a 20-day floating average. Typically either the entire contract (in the case of short-term contracts) or the price provisions of the contract (in the case of long-term contracts) are renegotiated at intervals ranging in frequency from daily to annually.
 
We have not yet adopted any specific sales and marketing plans. However, as we purchase future properties, the need to hire marketing personnel will be addressed.

Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, modernizing existing wells and marketing oil that is produced. The majority of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we plan to operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry.
 
Current competitive factors in the domestic oil and gas industry are unique. The actual price range of crude oil is largely established by major international producers. Pricing for natural gas is more regional; however, more favorable prices can usually be negotiated for larger quantities of oil and/or gas product. In this respect, while we believe we have a price disadvantage when compared to larger producers, we view our primary pricing risk to be related to a potential decline in international prices to a level which could render our production uneconomical.
 
We are committed to use the services of the existing gathering companies in the area of production. This potentially gives such gathering companies certain short-term relative monopolistic powers to set gathering and transportation costs, because obtaining the services of an alternative gathering company may require substantial additional costs.
 
General competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation introduced from time to time by the governments of the United States and other countries, as well as factors beyond our control, including international political conditions, overall levels of supply and demand for oil and gas, and the markets for synthetic fuels and alternative energy sources.
 
In the face of competition, we may not be successful in acquiring, exploring or developing profitable oil and gas properties or interests, and we cannot give any assurance that suitable properties or interests will be available for our acquisition, exploration or development. Despite this, we hope to compete successfully in the industry by:
 
 
· | keeping our costs low; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | relying on the strength of our management’s contacts; and 
· | using our size and experience to our advantage by adapting quickly to changing market conditions or responding swiftly to potential opportunities.

Distribution Methods
 
Any oil that we produce in the future will be distributed through oil gathering companies. Typically the contract operator makes the arrangements with the gathering companies.
Bankruptcy Or Similar Proceedings
 
There has been no bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding.
 
Reorganizations, Purchase Or Sale Of Assets
 
There have been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business.
 
Source And Availability Of Raw Materials
 
We have no significant raw materials. However, if we are successful in our plan of operations we may make use of numerous oil field service companies.

Major Customers
 
Any oil we may produce is sold through an operator to marketers and other purchasers that have access to nearby pipeline facilities. Generally, in areas where there is no practical access to pipelines, oil is trucked to storage facilities. We believe that the loss of any of these oil purchasers would not materially impact our business, because we could readily find other purchasers for our oil as produced.
Patents, Trademarks, Franchises, Royalty Agreements Or Labor Contracts
 
We have no patents, trademarks, licenses, concessions, or labor contracts.
 
Compliance With Government And Environmental Regulation
 
Regulation Of Transportation Of Oil
 
The sales of crude oil are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.
 
Our sales of crude oil will be affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or the FERC, regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state.
 
Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by pro-rationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors.
 
Regulation Of Production
 
The production of oil is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. All states, in which we may operate in the future, have regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil wells, the regulation of well spacing, and plugging and abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil that can be produced from wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations, although companies can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil within its jurisdiction.
 
The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.
 
Environmental Regulation
 
Oil exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Historically, most of the environmental regulation of oil production has been left to state regulatory boards or agencies in those jurisdictions where there is significant oil production, with limited direct regulation by such federal agencies as the Environmental Protection Agency. However, while we believe this generally to be the case for our production activities in Louisiana, there are various regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and other governmental agencies that would govern significant spills, blow-outs, or uncontrolled emissions.

7

 
In Louisiana, specific oil regulations apply to the drilling, completion and operations of wells, and the disposal of waste oil and salt water. There are also procedures incident to the plugging and abandonment of dry holes or other non-operational wells, all as governed by the applicable governing state agency.
 
At the federal level, among the more significant laws and regulations that may affect our business and the oil and gas industry are: The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, also known as “CERCLA” or Superfund; the Oil Pollution Act of 1990; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, also known as “RCRA”; the Clean Air Act; Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, or the Clean Water Act; and the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974.
 
Compliance with these regulations may constitute a significant cost and effort for us. No specific accounting for environmental compliance has been projected by us at this time. We are not presently aware of any environmental demands, claims, or adverse actions, litigation or administrative proceedings in which our acquired property is involved or subject to, or arising out of any predecessor operations.
 
In the event of a breach of environmental regulations, these environmental regulatory agencies have a broad range of alternative or cumulative remedies which include: ordering a clean-up of any spills or waste material and restoration of the soil or water to conditions existing prior to the environmental violation; fines; or enjoining further drilling, completion or production activities. In certain egregious situations the agencies may also pursue criminal remedies against us or our principal officers.
 
Research and Development
 
We have incurred $Nil in research and development expenditures over the last two fiscal years.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We do not currently have any intellectual property.
 
Employees
 
As of June 30, 2017, we have no employees. Our sole officer, Sonny Arandia currently devotes 2-4 hours per week to company matters. Once we have received additional funding, or have entered into a new lease or acquired a property, Mr. Arandia will devote as much time to our company as our board of directors determines is necessary to manage the affairs of our company.
 
We do not foresee hiring employees in the near future. We will engage independent contractors as needed who, under our direction, will fulfill the requirements of engagements that exceed our officers’ time constraints.
