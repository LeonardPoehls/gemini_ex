Item 1.    Business
THE COMPANY
Dynegy began operations in 1984 and became incorporated in the State of Delaware in 2007. We are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our business operations through our subsidiaries. Our primary business is the production and sale of electric energy, capacity and ancillary services from our fleet of 50 power plants in 12 states totaling approximately 31,000 MW of generating capacity (including the assets acquired in the Delta Transaction, which closed on February 7, 2017). References to our net generation capacity throughout this Form 10-K include the impacts of the Delta Transaction.
We sell electric energy, capacity and ancillary services primarily on a wholesale basis from our power generation facilities. We also serve residential, municipal, commercial and industrial customers primarily in MISO and PJM through our Homefield Energy and Dynegy Energy Services retail businesses, through which we provide retail electricity to approximately 963,000 residential customers and approximately 42,000 commercial, industrial and municipal customers in Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Wholesale electricity customers will primarily contract for rights to capacity from generating units for reliability reasons and to meet regulatory requirements. Ancillary services support the transmission grid operation, follow real-time changes in load and provide emergency reserves for major changes to the balance of generation and load. Retail electricity customers purchase energy and these related services in the deregulated retail energy market. We sell these products individually or in combination to our customers for various lengths of time from hourly to multi-year transactions.

We do business with a wide range of customers, including RTOs and ISOs, integrated utilities, municipalities, electric cooperatives, transmission and distribution utilities, power marketers, financial participants such as banks and hedge funds, and residential, commercial, and industrial end-users. Some of our customers, such as municipalities or integrated utilities, purchase our products for resale in order to serve their retail, commercial and industrial customers. Other customers, such as some power marketers, may buy from us to serve their own wholesale or retail customers or as a hedge against power sales they have made.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, Dynegy changed its organizational structure to manage its assets, make financial decisions, and allocate resources based upon the market areas in which our plants operate. As of December 31, 2016, we modified our reportable segments from a fuel-based segment structure to the following market areas: (i) PJM, (ii) ISO-NE/NYISO (“NY/NE”), (iii) MISO, (iv) IPH and (v) CAISO. Accordingly, the Company has recast data from prior periods to reflect this change in reportable segments to conform to the current year presentation. Our consolidated financial results also reflect corporate-level expenses such as general and administrative expense, interest expense and income tax benefit (expense). Additionally, beginning in 2017, as a result of the Delta Transaction, we also have an ERCOT segment. Please read Note 23—Segment Information for further discussion.
Our principal executive office is located at 601 Travis Street, Suite 1400, Houston, Texas 77002, and our telephone number is (713) 507-6400. We file annual, quarterly and current reports, and other information with the SEC.

 Business Strategies
Our business strategy is to create value through the optimization of our generation facilities, cost structure and financial resources.
Customer Focus. Our commercial outreach focuses on the needs of the customers and constituents we serve, including the end-use and wholesale customer, our market channel partners and the government agencies and regulatory bodies that represent the public interest. The insight provided through these relationships will influence our decisions aimed at meeting customer needs while optimizing the value of our business.
Currently, our commercial strategy seeks to optimize the value of our assets by locking in near-term cash flow while preserving the ability to capture higher values long-term as power markets improve. We may hedge portions of the expected output from our facilities with the goal of stabilizing near-term earnings and cash flow while preserving upside potential should commodity prices or market factors improve. Our wholesale organization and retail marketing teams are responsible for implementation of this strategy. These teams provide access to a broad portfolio of customers with varying energy and capacity requirements. There is a significant risk reduction from the relationship between our generation and our customer load which reduces the need to transact additional financial hedging products in the market. We expect to expand our retail load in areas in which our generation is located, thereby further reducing our risk profile and the need to transact additional financial hedging products.
Our wholesale origination efforts focus on marketing energy and capacity and providing certain associated services through structured transactions that are designed to meet our customers’ operating, financial and risk requirements while simultaneously compensating Dynegy appropriately. In order to optimize the value of our generation portfolio, we use a wide range of products and contracts such as tolling agreements, fuel supply contracts, capacity auctions, bilateral capacity contracts, power and natural gas swap agreements and other financial instruments. 
Our retail marketing efforts focus on offering end-use customers energy products that range from fixed price and full requirements to flexible price and volume structures. Our goal is to deliver value beyond price by leveraging our experience in the energy markets to provide products that help customers make sound energy decisions. Establishing and maintaining strong relationships with retail energy channel partners is another key focus where personal service and transparent communication further build our retail brands as trusted suppliers. Our objective is to maximize the benefit to both Dynegy and our customers.
Dynegy operates in a complex and highly-regulated environment with multiple federal, state and local stakeholders, such as legislators, government agencies, industry groups, consumers and environmental advocates. Dynegy works with these stakeholders to encourage reasonable regulations, constructive market designs and balanced environmental policies. Our regulatory 
6

strategy includes a continuous process of advocacy, visibility, education and engagement. The ultimate goal is to find solutions that provide adequate cost recovery, incentives for investment, and safe, reliable, cost-effective and environmentally-compliant generation for the communities we serve.
Continuous Improvement.  We are committed to operating all of our facilities in a safe, reliable, cost-efficient and environmentally compliant manner. We will continue to invest in our facilities to maintain and improve the safety, reliability and efficiency of our fleet.
We continue to employ our cost and performance improvement initiative launched in 2011, known as PRIDE, which is designed to drive recurring cash flow benefits by optimizing our cost structure, implementing company-wide process and operating improvements, and improving balance sheet efficiency. Historical PRIDE results as well as our new 3-year targets are shown below. In 2016, we exceeded our balance sheet target of $200 million by $222 million, and exceeded our EBITDA target of $135 million by $15 million. 
Capital Allocation.  The power industry is a capital intensive, cyclical commodity business with significant commodity price volatility. As such, it is imperative to build and maintain a balance sheet with manageable debt levels supported by a flexible and diverse liquidity program. Our ongoing capital allocation priorities, first and foremost, are to maintain an appropriate leverage and liquidity profile and to make the necessary capital investments to maintain the safety and reliability of our fleet and to comply with environmental rules and regulations. We also evaluate other capital allocation options including investing in our existing portfolio, making potential acquisitions, and returning capital to shareholders. Capital allocation decisions are generally based on alternatives that provide the highest risk adjusted rates of return.
We continue to focus on maintaining a diverse liquidity program to support our ongoing operations and commercial activities. This includes maintaining adequate cash balances, expanding our first lien collateral program to include additional hedging counterparties and having in place sufficient committed lines of credit and revolving credit facilities to support our ongoing liquidity needs. 
7

 Since 2013, we have increased scale and shifted our portfolio mix, which was predominately coal-based, to a predominately gas-based portfolio, through four major acquisitions. We used a significant portion of our balance sheet capacity to finance these acquisitions. Accordingly, we are now focused on strengthening our balance sheet, managing debt maturities and improving our leverage profile through debt reduction primarily from operating cash flows, PRIDE initiatives and select asset sales.

Recent Developments
Delta Transaction
On February 7, 2017, (“the Delta Transaction Closing Date”), Dynegy acquired approximately 9,017 MW of generation, including (i) 15 natural gas-fired facilities located in Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia, (ii) one coal-fired facility in Texas, and (iii) one waste coal-fired facility in Pennsylvania for a base purchase price of approximately $3.3 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments (the “Delta Transaction”). Additionally, Dynegy paid Energy Capital Partners (“ECP”) $375 million (the “ECP Buyout Price”) and issued 13,711,152 shares of Dynegy common stock for $150 million. Please read Note 24—Subsequent Events for further discussion. 
Sale of Elwood
On November 21, 2016, we sold our 50 percent equity interest in the Elwood Energy facility in Elwood, IL, to J-Power USA Development Co. Ltd. for approximately $173 million (the “Elwood Sale”). As part of the transaction, approximately $35 million of previously posted collateral has been returned to us, and the non-recourse, asset-level financing remains with the new owner. Please read Note 11—Unconsolidated Investments for further discussion.
2025 Senior Notes and Term Loan Repayment
On October 11, 2016, we issued, in a private placement transaction, $750 million of 8 percent unsecured senior notes due 2025 (the “2025 Senior Notes”). The 2025 Senior Notes do not provide registration rights but otherwise have terms and provisions similar to our approximately $5.6 billion in senior notes (“Dynegy Senior Notes”). On December 9, 2016, we voluntarily repaid $550 million of our $800 million seven-year senior secured term loan facility (the “Tranche B-2 Term Loan”). Please read Note 14—Debt for further discussion.
Term Loan Repricing
Upon the Delta Transaction Closing Date, we amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, (1) reduce the interest rate by 75 basis points, and (2) extend the maturity of the existing Tranche B-2 Term Loans to 2024 through the exchange of the outstanding Initial Tranche B-2 Term Loans for Tranche C-1 Term Loans. The reduced interest rate is expected to save Dynegy approximately $100 million in interest costs over the next seven years.
Asset Sales
On February 23, 2017, Dynegy reached an agreement with LS Power for the sale of two peaking facilities in PJM for $480 million in cash. The assets to be sold, which were recently acquired in the Delta Transaction, include the Armstrong and 
8

Troy facilities totaling 1,269 MW. The sale is expected to close in the second half of 2017 with the proceeds to be allocated to debt reduction.    
Acquisition and Sale of Interests in Jointly Owned Facilities
On February 23, 2017, Dynegy reached an agreement with American Electric Power (“AEP”) to realign and consolidate each company’s ownership interests in the Conesville and Zimmer Power Stations in Ohio. Under the agreement, Dynegy will sell its 40 percent ownership interest in Conesville to AEP, and will acquire AEP‘s 25.4 percent ownership interest in Zimmer. As a result, Dynegy will own 71.9 percent of the Zimmer facility and will no longer have an ownership interest in the AEP operated Conesville facility. No cash will be exchanged in the transaction and no additional debt will be incurred by either party.
Genco Restructuring
On December 9, 2016, Illinois Power Generating Company (“Genco”) filed a petition (the “Bankruptcy Petition”) under Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”). On January 25, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the prepackaged plan of reorganization (the “Genco Plan”) and Genco emerged from bankruptcy on February 2, 2017 (the “Emergence Date”). As a result, we eliminated $825 million of Genco Senior Notes. On the Emergence Date, we exchanged $757 million of the Genco Senior Notes for $113 million of cash, $182 million of new Dynegy seven-year unsecured notes, and 8.7 million Dynegy common stock warrants. Holders of Genco Senior Notes who did not receive a distribution under the Genco Plan on the Emergence Date have until July 17, 2017 (the 165th day after the Emergence Date) in order to exercise their rights to receive a distribution. Please read Note 22—Genco Chapter 11 Bankruptcy for further discussion.
Through the Emergence Date, IPH and its direct and indirect subsidiaries were organized into ring-fenced groups in order to maintain corporate separateness from Dynegy and our other legal entities. Certain of the entities in the IPH segment, including Genco, had an independent director whose consent was required for certain corporate actions, including material transactions with affiliates. Further, there were restrictions on pledging their assets for the benefit of certain other persons.  These provisions restricted our ability to move cash out of these entities without meeting certain requirements as set forth in the governing documents. After the Emergence Date, these entities present themselves to the public as separate entities. They also maintain corporate formalities including separate books, records and bank accounts and separately appoint officers.  Furthermore, they pay liabilities from their own funds and conduct business in their own names.

MARKET DISCUSSION
Our business operations are focused primarily on the wholesale power generation sector of the energy industry. We manage and report the results of our power generation business within six segments on a consolidated basis: (i) PJM, (ii) NY/NE, (iii) ERCOT, (iv) MISO, (v) IPH, and (vi) CAISO. During 2016 we changed our segment structure. Please read Note 23—Segment Information for further information regarding revenues from external customers, operating income (loss) and total assets by segment. The discussion herein reflects capacities at our net ownership interest.
We continue to expect that, over the longer-term, power and capacity pricing will improve as natural gas prices increase, marginal generating units retire, and more stringent environmental regulations force the retirement of power generation units that have not invested in environmental upgrades. As a result, we believe our coal-fired fleets are well positioned to benefit from higher power and capacity prices in the Midwest. We also expect these same factors will benefit our combined-cycle units throughout the country through increased run-times and/or higher power prices as heat rates expand resulting in improved margins and cash flows. 
NERC Regions, RTOs and ISOs
  In discussing our business, we often refer to NERC regions. The NERC and its regional reliability entities were formed to ensure the reliability and security of the electricity system. The regional reliability entities set standards for reliable operation and maintenance of power generation facilities and transmission systems. For example, each NERC region establishes a minimum operating reserve requirement to ensure there is sufficient generating capacity to meet expected demand within its region. Each NERC region reports seasonally and annually on the status of generation and transmission in such region.
Separately, RTOs and ISOs administer the transmission infrastructure and markets across a regional footprint in most of the markets in which we operate. They are responsible for dispatching all generation facilities in their respective footprints and are responsible for both maximum utilization and reliable and efficient operation of the transmission system. RTOs and ISOs administer energy and ancillary service markets in the short term, usually day-ahead and real-time markets. Several RTOs and ISOs also ensure long-term planning reserves through monthly, semi-annual, annual and multi-year capacity markets. The RTOs and ISOs that oversee most of the wholesale power markets in which we operate currently impose, and will likely continue to impose, bid and price limits or other similar mechanisms. NERC regions and RTOs/ISOs often have different geographic footprints, and while there may be geographic overlap between NERC regions and RTOs/ISOs, their respective roles and responsibilities do not generally overlap.
In RTO and ISO regions with centrally dispatched market structures, all generators selling into the centralized market receive the same price for energy sold based on the bid price associated with the production of the last MWh that is needed to balance supply with demand within a designated zone or at a given location. Different zones or locations within the same RTO/
10

ISO may produce different prices respective to other zones within the same RTO/ISO due to transmission losses and congestion. For example, a less efficient and/or less economical natural gas-fired unit may be needed in some hours to meet demand. If this unit’s production is required to meet demand on the margin, its bid price will set the market clearing price that will be paid for all dispatched generation in the same zone or location (although the price paid at other zones or locations may vary because of transmission losses and congestion), regardless of the price that any other unit may have offered into the market. In RTO and ISO regions with centrally dispatched market structures and location-based marginal price clearing structures (e.g. PJM, ISO-NE, NYISO, ERCOT, MISO, and CAISO), generators will receive the location-based marginal price for their output. The location-based marginal price, absent congestion, would be the marginal price of the most expensive unit needed to meet demand. In regions that are outside the footprint of RTOs/ISOs, prices are determined on a bilateral basis between buyers and sellers.
Reserve Margins
 RTOs and ISOs are required to meet NERC planning and resource adequacy standards.  The reserve margin, which is the amount of generation resources in excess of peak load, is a measure of resource adequacy and is also used to assess the supply-demand balance of a region.  RTOs and ISOs use various mechanisms to help market participants meet their planning reserve margin requirements.  Mechanisms range from centralized capacity markets administered by the ISO to markets where entities fulfill their requirements through a combination of long- and short-term bilateral contracts between individual counterparties and self-generation.
Contracted Capacity and Energy
We commercialize our assets through a combination of bilateral wholesale and retail physical and financial power sales, fuel purchases and tolling arrangements. Uncontracted energy is sold in the various ISOs’ day ahead and real-time markets.  Capacity is commercialized through a combination of centrally cleared auctions and/or bilateral contracts. We use our retail activity to hedge a portion of the output from our MISO and PJM facilities.
PJM Segment
Our PJM segment is comprised of 23 power generation facilities located in Ohio (11), Pennsylvania (5), Illinois (4), Virginia (1), West Virginia (1) and New Jersey (1), totaling 13,510 MW of electric generating capacity. 
RTO/ISO Discussion
The PJM market includes all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.
PJM administers markets for wholesale electricity and provides transmission planning for the region, utilizing an LMP methodology which calculates a price for every generator and load point within PJM.  This market is transparent, allowing generators and load serving entities to see real-time price effects of transmission constraints and the impacts of congestion at each pricing point. PJM operates day-ahead and real-time markets into which generators can bid to provide energy and ancillary services. PJM also administers a forward capacity auction, the Reliability Pricing Model (“RPM”), which establishes long-term markets for capacity. We have participated in RPM base residual auctions for years up to and including PJM’s Planning Year 2019-2020, which ends May 31, 2020. We also enter into bilateral capacity transactions. Beginning with Planning Year 2016-2017, PJM has started to transition to Capacity Performance (“CP”) rules. Full transition of the capacity market to these new rules will occur by Planning Year 2020-2021. These rules are designed to improve system reliability and include penalties for underperforming units and rewards for overperforming units during shortage events. Beginning in Planning Year 2018-2019, PJM introduced Base Capacity (“Base”), which, alongside its new CP product, replaced the legacy capacity product. Base capacity resources are those capacity resources that are not capable of sustained, predictable operation throughout the entire delivery year, but are capable of providing energy and reserves during hot weather operations. They are subject to non-performance charges assessed during emergency conditions, from June through September. An independent market monitor continually monitors PJM markets to ensure a robust, competitive market and to identify any improper behavior by any entity.
Reserve Margins
Planning Reserve Margins based on deliverable capacity by Planning Year are as follows:

 | 2016-2017 | 2017-2018 | 2018-2019 | 2019-2020 | 2020-2021
Planning Reserve Margin (%) | 15.6 | 15.7 | 15.7 | 16.5 | 16.6 

11

NY/NE Segment
Our NY/NE segment is comprised of 11 power generation facilities located in Massachusetts (7), Connecticut (2), Maine (1) and New York (1), totaling 6,543 MW of electric generating capacity. 
RTO/ISO Discussion
The NYISO market includes the entire state of New York. The NYISO market dispatches power plants to meet system energy and reliability needs and settles physical power deliveries at LMPs. Energy prices vary among the regional zones in the NYISO and are largely influenced by transmission constraints and fuel supply. NYISO offers a forward capacity market where capacity prices are determined through auctions. Strip auctions occur one to two months prior to the commencement of a six month seasonal planning period. Subsequent auctions provide an opportunity to sell excess capacity for the balance of the seasonal planning period or the prompt month. Due to the short term nature of the NYISO-operated capacity auctions and a relatively liquid market for NYISO capacity products, our Independence facility sells a significant portion of its capacity through bilateral transactions. The balance is cleared through the seasonal and monthly capacity auctions.
The ISO-NE market includes the six New England states of Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Maine. ISO-NE also dispatches power plants to meet system energy and reliability needs and settles physical power deliveries at LMPs. Energy prices vary among the participating states in ISO-NE and are largely influenced by transmission constraints and fuel supply. ISO-NE offers a forward capacity market where capacity prices are determined through auctions. ISO-NE implemented changes to its capacity market starting in FCA-8 for Planning Year 2017-2018, which include removal of the price floor and implementation of a minimum offer price rule for new resources to prevent buy-side market power. Additionally, performance incentive rules will go into effect for Planning Year 2018-2019 (FCA-9), which will have the potential to increase capacity payments for those resources that are providing excess energy or reserves during a shortage event, while penalizing those that produce less than the required level.
Reserve Margins
NYISO. The actual amount of installed capacity is approximately seven percentage points above NYISO’s current Planning Reserve Margin. Planning Reserve Margins by Planning Year are as follows:

 | 2016-2017 | 2017-2018
Planning Reserve Margin (%) | 17.4 | 18.1 

ISO-NE. Similar to PJM, ISO-NE will publish on an annual basis the installed capacity requirement, commonly referred to as the ICR.  The ICR is the amount of capacity that must be procured over and above the load forecast for the applicable Planning Year.  ISO-NE updates this information annually for each planning year during the Annual Reconfiguration Auctions. ICRs by Planning Year are as follows:

 | 2017-2018 | 2018-2019 | 2019-2020 | 2020-2021
ICR (%) | 15.1 | 15.0 | 15.0 | 15.1 

ERCOT Segment
Our ERCOT segment, new in 2017 as a result of the Delta Transaction, is comprised of six power generation facilities located in Texas, totaling 4,696 MW of electric generating capacity. Our ERCOT fleet is comprised of 3,976 MW of natural gas powered combined-cycle generation, 635 MW of Powder River Basin coal powered generation, and 85 MW of natural gas powered peaking generation.
RTO/ISO Discussion
ERCOT serves about 90 percent of load in the state of Texas over a high-voltage transmission system of more than 46,500 circuit miles. The ERCOT system is entirely contained within the state of Texas, and thus is regulated by the Texas Public Utility Commission rather than the FERC. The ERCOT nodal market provides a transparent means to reflect the cost of congestion in nodal prices across the system. The day-ahead market and real-time markets provide generators the ability to competitively offer energy and ancillary services into the market. ERCOT is an “energy-only” market, meaning there is no capacity market. Alternatively, ERCOT has implemented the Operating Reserve Demand Curve (“ORDC”), which causes prices to rise to as much as $9,000/MWh during reserve shortage events. ERCOT has a high level of wind generation, which tends to be a source of real-time price volatility. 
12

Reserve Margins
As contained in ERCOT’s December 2016 Capacity, Demand and Reserves (“CDR”) report, the Target Reserve Margin is 13.75 percent through 2021.
MISO & IPH Segments
Our MISO segment is comprised of three power generation facilities located in Illinois, totaling 1,913 MW of electric generating capacity.  Beginning June 1, 2017, Hennepin will pseudo-tie and offer energy and capacity for 260 MW, or 14 percent of our MISO segment’s current capacity and energy, into PJM.  
Our IPH segment is comprised of five coal-fired power generation facilities located in Illinois with a total generating capacity of 3,563 MW, and primarily operates in MISO. Joppa, which is within the Electric Energy, Inc. (“EEI”) control area, is interconnected to Tennessee Valley Authority and Louisville Gas and Electric Company, but primarily sells its capacity and energy to MISO. We currently offer a portion of our IPH segment generating capacity and energy into PJM. As of June 1, 2016, our Coffeen, Duck Creek, E.D. Edwards and Newton facilities have 937 MW, or 26 percent of IPH’s current capacity and energy, electrically tied into PJM through pseudo-tie arrangements. IPH has secured firm transmission to export into PJM from our Joppa facility beginning June 1, 2017. As of June 1, 2017, IPH will have the capability to offer another 240 MW of capacity and energy into PJM for a total of 1,177 MW.
RTO/ISO Discussion
The MISO market includes all or parts of Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas, Louisiana, Montana, South Dakota, and Manitoba, Canada. 
The MISO energy market is designed to ensure that all market participants have open-access to the transmission system on a non-discriminatory basis. MISO, as an independent RTO, maintains functional control over the use of the transmission system to ensure transmission circuits do not exceed their secure operating limits and become overloaded. MISO operates day-ahead and real-time energy markets using a similar LMP methodology as described above. An independent market monitor is responsible for evaluating the performance of the markets and identifying conduct by market participants or MISO that may compromise the efficiency or distort the outcome of the markets.
MISO administers a one-year FCA for the next planning year from June 1st of the current year to May 31st of the following year. We participate in these auctions with open capacity that has not been committed through bilateral or retail transactions.
We participate in the MISO annual and monthly FTR auctions to manage the cost of our transmission congestion, as measured by the congestion component of the LMP price differential between two points on the transmission grid across the market area.
Reserve Margins
Planning Reserve Margins by Planning Year are as follows:
    
 | 2017-2018 | 2018-2019 | 2019-2020 | 2020-2021 | 2021-2022

CAISO Segment
Our CAISO segment is comprised of two power generation facilities located in California, totaling 1,185 MW of electric generating capacity.
RTO/ISO Discussion
The CAISO market covers approximately 90 percent of the State of California and operates a centrally cleared market for energy and ancillary services. Energy is priced utilizing an LMP methodology as described above. The capacity market is comprised of Standard and Flexible Resource Adequacy (“RA”) Capacity. Unlike other centrally cleared capacity markets, the CAISO resource adequacy market is a bilaterally traded market which typically transacts in monthly products as opposed to annual capacity products in other regions. Beginning on November 1, 2016, CAISO implemented a voluntary capacity auction for annual, monthly, and intra-month procurement to cover for deficiencies in the market.  The voluntary Competitive Solicitation Process, which FERC approved on October 1, 2015, is a modification to the Capacity Priced Mechanism (“CPM”) and provides another avenue to sell RA capacity. There have been recent CPM designations through the Competitive Solicitation Process including Moss Landing Unit 1 on December 18, 2016.

Market-Based Rates.  Our ability to charge market-based rates for wholesale sales of electricity, as opposed to cost-based rates, is governed by FERC. We have been granted market-based rate authority for wholesale power sales from our exempt wholesale generator facilities, as well as wholesale power sales by our power marketing entities, Dynegy Power Marketing, LLC, Dynegy Marketing and Trade, LLC, Illinois Power Marketing Company (“IPM”), Dynegy Energy Services, LLC, and Dynegy Commercial Asset Management, LLC. Every three years, FERC conducts a review of our market-based rates and potential market power on a regional basis (known as the triennial market power review). In June 2016, we filed a market power update with FERC for our CAISO assets. 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning environmental matters, including the discharge of materials into the environment. We are committed to operating within these laws and regulations and to conducting our business in an environmentally responsible manner. The environmental, legal and regulatory landscape continues to change and has become more stringent over time. This may create unprofitable or unfavorable operating conditions or require significant capital and operating expenditures. Further, changing interpretations of existing regulations may subject historical maintenance, repair and replacement activities at our facilities to claims of noncompliance.
The following is a summary of (i) the material federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations applicable to us and (ii) certain pending judicial and administrative proceedings related thereto.  Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations and resolution of these various proceedings may result in increased capital expenditures and other environmental compliance costs, impairments, increased operations and maintenance expenses, increased Asset Retirement Obligations (“AROs”), and the imposition of fines and penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  In addition, if we are required to incur significant additional costs or expenses to comply with applicable environmental laws or to resolve a related proceeding, the incurrence of such costs or expenses may render continued operation of a plant uneconomical such that we may determine, subject to applicable laws and any applicable financing or other agreements, to reduce the plant’s operations to minimize such costs or expenses or cease to operate the plant completely to avoid such costs or expenses.  Unless otherwise expressly noted in the following summary, we are not currently able to reasonably estimate the costs and expenses, or range of the costs and expenses, associated with complying with these environmental laws and regulations or with resolution of these judicial and administrative proceedings.  For additional information regarding our pending environmental judicial and administrative proceedings, please read Note 17—Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion.

The Clean Air Act
The CAA and comparable state laws and regulations relating to air emissions impose various responsibilities on owners and operators of sources of air emissions, which include requirements to obtain construction and operating permits, pay permit fees, monitor emissions, submit reports and compliance certifications, and keep records. The CAA requires that fossil-fueled electric generating plants meet certain pollutant emission standards and have sufficient emission allowances to cover sulfur dioxide (“SO2”) emissions and in some regions nitrogen oxide (“NOx”) emissions. 
In order to ensure continued compliance with the CAA and related rules and regulations, we utilize various emission reduction technologies. These technologies include flue gas desulfurization (“FGD”) systems, baghouses and activated carbon injection or mercury oxidation systems on select units and electrostatic precipitators, selective catalytic reduction (“SCR”) systems, low-NOx burners and/or overfire air systems on all units. Additionally, our MISO coal-fired facilities mainly use low sulfur coal, which, prior to combustion, goes through a refined coal process to further reduce NOx and mercury emissions. 
Multi-Pollutant Air Emission Initiatives
Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. The “Cross-State Air Pollution Rule” (“CSAPR”) to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx from EGUs across the eastern U.S. took effect in 2015. The CSAPR imposes cap-and-trade programs within each affected state that limit emissions of SO2 and NOx at levels to help downwind states attain and maintain compliance with the 1997 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) and the 1997 and 2006 fine particulate matter (“PM2.5”) NAAQS. 
Under the CSAPR, our generating facilities in Illinois, Ohio, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and West Virginia are subject to cap-and-trade programs for ozone-season emissions of NOx from May 1 through September 30 and for annual emissions of SO2 and NOx. The CSAPR requirements applicable to SO2 emissions from our affected EGUs will be implemented in two stages with fewer SO2 emission allowances allocated in the second phase, which begins in 2017. In September 2016, the EPA issued a CSAPR update rule. 
Mercury/HAPs.  The EPA’s Mercury and Air Toxic Standards (“MATS”) rule for EGUs, which was issued in 2011, established numeric emission limits for mercury, non-mercury metals, and acid gases as well as work practice standards for organic HAPs. Compliance with the MATS rule was required by April 16, 2015, unless an extension was granted in accordance with the CAA. In March 2016, the EPA finalized corrections to its November 2014 MATS rule revisions addressing startup and shutdown monitoring instrumentation. 
In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the EPA failed to properly consider costs when it promulgated the MATS rule. In response to a court ordered remand, in April 2016, the EPA issued a final finding that consideration of cost does not change the Agency’s determination that regulation of HAP emissions from coal- and oil-fired EGUs is appropriate and necessary under CAA section 112. Petitions for judicial review have been filed. 
We are in compliance with the MATS rule emission limits and continue to monitor the performance of our units and evaluate approaches to optimize compliance strategies. 
Illinois MPS. In 2007, our MISO coal-fired facilities elected to demonstrate compliance with the Illinois Multi-Pollutant Standards (“MPS”), which require compliance with NOx, SO2 and mercury emissions limits. We are in compliance with the MPS. 
IPH Variance.  The MPS SO2 limits started in 2010 for our IPH coal-fired facilities and would have declined in 2014 and 2015 and required compliance with the final SO2 limit beginning in 2017. However, the IPCB granted IPH a variance which provided additional time for economic recovery and related power price improvements necessary to support the installation of 
15

FGD systems at the Newton facility such that the IPH coal-fired fleet can meet the MPS system-wide SO2 limit. In December 2015, the EPA approved the variance as part of the Illinois regional haze state implementation plan (“SIP”). 
On September 2, 2016, IPH and Ameren Energy Medina Valley Cogen, LLC filed a motion with the IPCB to terminate the variance. On October 27, 2016, the IPCB granted the motion to terminate the variance.
Other Air Emission Initiatives
NAAQS. The CAA requires the EPA to regulate emissions of pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment. The EPA has established NAAQS for six such pollutants, including ozone, SO2 and PM2.5. Each state is responsible for developing a plan (a SIP) that will attain and maintain the NAAQS.  These plans may result in the imposition of emission limits on our facilities.
The EPA’s initial area designations for the 2010 one-hour SO2 NAAQS included designating as nonattainment the area where our IPH segment’s Edwards facility is located. In January 2015, Illinois Power Resources Generating, LLC (“IPRG”) entered a Memorandum of Agreement (“MOA”) with the Illinois EPA (“IEPA”) that voluntarily committed to early limits on Edwards’ allowable one-hour SO2 emission rate that, in conjunction with reductions to be imposed by the state on other sources, will enable the IEPA to demonstrate attainment with the one-hour SO2 NAAQS in the Edwards area. The IPCB subsequently approved an IEPA rule that included the emission limits on Edwards as agreed to in the MOA.
The EPA will complete area designations for the 2010 one-hour SO2 NAAQS in up to three additional rounds over the period July 2016 to December 31, 2020. In July 2016, the EPA designated as unclassifiable/attainment the areas of our Newton, Hennepin, Joppa and Wood River facilities and our co-owned Zimmer facility. 
The EPA issued a final rule in October 2015 lowering the ozone NAAQS from 75 to 70 parts per billion. The EPA anticipates designating attainment and nonattainment areas for the 2015 ozone NAAQS by October 2017. Various parties have filed lawsuits challenging the 2015 ozone NAAQS. In November 2016, the State of Maryland petitioned the EPA under CAA section 126 to impose additional NOx emission control requirements on 36 EGUs in five upwind states, including our co-owned Zimmer facility, that the State alleges are contributing to nonattainment with the 2008 ozone NAAQS in Maryland. The EPA is required to act on the petition by July 15, 2017. In January 2017, the EPA proposed to deny a petition from nine northeastern states to add several states, including Illinois and Ohio, to the Ozone Transport Region.
In May 2015, the EPA issued a final rule that eliminates existing exemptions in the SIPs of many states, including Illinois and Ohio, for emissions during periods of startup, shutdown or malfunction (“SSM”). Under the rule, affected states were required to submit corrective SIP revisions by November 2016. Various parties have filed lawsuits challenging the EPA’s SSM SIP rule. 
The nature and scope of potential future requirements concerning the 2010 one-hour SO2 NAAQS, ozone NAAQS and SSM SIP rule cannot be predicted with confidence at this time. A future requirement for additional emission reductions at any of our coal-fired generating facilities may result in significantly increased compliance costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
New Source Review and Clean Air Act Matters 
New Source Review. Since 1999, the EPA has been engaged in a nationwide enforcement initiative to determine whether coal-fired power plants failed to comply with the requirements of the New Source Review and New Source Performance Standard provisions under the CAA when the plants implemented modifications. The EPA’s initiative focuses on whether projects performed at power plants triggered various permitting requirements, including the need to install pollution control equipment.
In August 2012, the EPA issued a Notice of Violation (“NOV”) alleging that projects performed in 1997, 2006 and 2007 at the Newton facility violated Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”), Title V permitting and other requirements. The NOV remains unresolved. We believe our defenses to the allegations described in the NOV are meritorious. A decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in 2013 held that similar claims older than five years were barred by the statute of limitations. This decision may provide an additional defense to the allegations in the Newton facility NOV. 
Wood River CAA Section 114 Information Request. In 2014, we received an information request from the EPA concerning our Wood River facility’s compliance with the Illinois SIP and associated permits. We responded to the EPA’s request and believe that there are no issues with Wood River’s compliance, but we are unable to predict the EPA’s response, if any. As of June 1, 2016, our Wood River facility has been retired.
CAA Notices of Violation. In December 2014, the EPA issued an NOV alleging violation of opacity standards at the Zimmer facility, which we co-own and operate. The EPA previously had issued NOVs to Zimmer in 2008 and 2010 alleging violations of the CAA, the Ohio SIP and the station’s air permits involving standards applicable to opacity, sulfur dioxide, sulfuric 
16

acid mist and heat input. The NOVs remain unresolved. In December 2014, the EPA also issued NOVs alleging violations of opacity standards at the Stuart and Killen facilities, which we jointly own but do not operate.
Coleto Creek Regional Haze/BART.  The EPA issued a federal implementation plan (“FIP”) in December 2015 for the State of Texas that imposed regional haze program requirements on numerous coal-fired EGUs. The FIP would require Coleto Creek to meet an SO2 emission limit of 0.04 lbs/MMBtu by February 2021, based on installation of a scrubber. Coleto Creek, other electricity generating companies and the State of Texas filed petitions for judicial review, including motions to stay the FIP, in federal court. In July 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stayed the FIP pending completion of judicial review. The EPA subsequently requested a voluntary remand of the challenged portions of the FIP.
In January 2017, the EPA proposed a FIP for Texas that would impose Best Available Retrofit Technology (“BART”) emission limits for SO2 on numerous EGUs, including Coleto Creek. BART requirements for EGUs were not addressed in the EPA’s December 2015 regional haze FIP for Texas. The proposed FIP BART SO2 emissions limit for Coleto Creek is 0.04 lbs/MMBtu based on installation of a scrubber. Compliance would be required within five years from the effective date of a final rule. 
Edwards CAA Citizen Suit. In April 2013, environmental groups filed a CAA citizen suit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois alleging violations of opacity and particulate matter limits at our IPH segment’s Edwards facility. In August 2016, the District Court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment on certain liability issues. We filed a motion seeking interlocutory appeal of the court’s summary judgment ruling. In February 2017, the appellate court denied our motion for interlocutory appeal. The District Court has not yet scheduled the remedy phase of the case. We dispute the allegations and will defend the case vigorously. 
Ultimate resolution of any of these CAA matters could have a material adverse impact on our future financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. A resolution could result in increased capital expenditures for the installation of pollution control equipment, increased operations and maintenance expenses, and penalties. At this time we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the possible costs, or range of costs, that might be incurred to resolve these matters.
The Clean Water Act 
The Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and analogous state laws regulate water withdrawals and wastewater discharges at our power generation facilities. Our facilities are authorized to discharge pollutants to waters of the United States by National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permits, which contain discharge limits and monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. NPDES permits are issued for 5-year periods and are subject to renewal after expiration. 
Cooling Water Intake Structures. Cooling water intake structures at our facilities are regulated under CWA Section 316(b). This provision generally requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect best technology available (“BTA”) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. Historically, permitting authorities have developed and implemented BTA standards through NPDES permits on a case-by-case basis using best professional judgment.
In 2014, the EPA issued a final rule for cooling water intake structures at existing facilities. The rule establishes seven BTA alternatives for reducing impingement mortality, including modified traveling screens, closed-cycle cooling, a numeric impingement standard, or a site-specific determination. For entrainment, the permitting authority is required to establish a case-by-case standard considering several factors, including social costs and benefits. Compliance with the rule’s entrainment and impingement mortality standards is required as soon as practicable, but will vary by site depending on several different factors, including determinations made by the state permitting authority and the timing of renewal of a facility’s NPDES permit. Various environmental groups and industry groups filed petitions for judicial review of the EPA’s final rule.
At this time, we estimate the cost of our compliance with the cooling water intake structure rule (excluding Delta Transaction) will be approximately $17 million, with the majority of spend in the 2020-2023 timeframe. This estimate excludes Moss Landing, which is discussed in “California Water Intake Policy” below. Our estimate could change materially depending upon a variety of factors, including site-specific determinations made by states in implementing the rule, the results of impingement and entrainment studies required by the rule, the results of site-specific engineering studies, and the outcome of litigation concerning the rule.
California Water Intake Policy.  The California State Water Board (the “State Water Board”) adopted its Statewide Water Quality Control Policy on the Use of Coastal and Estuarine Waters for Power Plant Cooling (the “Policy”) in 2010. The Policy requires existing power plants to reduce water intake flow rate to a level commensurate with that which can be achieved by a closed cycle cooling system or if that is not feasible, to reduce impingement mortality and entrainment to a level comparable to that achieved by such a reduced water intake flow rate using operational or structural controls, or both. 
17

In 2014, we entered into a settlement agreement with the State Water Board that would resolve a lawsuit we filed with other California power plant owners challenging the Policy. In accordance with the settlement agreement, following a public rulemaking process, in April 2015, the State Water Board approved an amendment to the Policy extending the compliance deadline for Moss Landing from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2020. Under the settlement agreement, we have implemented operational control measures at Moss Landing for purposes of reducing impingement mortality and entrainment, including the installation of variable speed drive motors on the circulating water pumps in late 2016. In addition, we must evaluate and install supplemental control technology by December 31, 2020. At this time, we preliminarily estimate the cost of our compliance at Moss Landing under the provisions of the settlement agreement will be approximately $10 million in aggregate through 2020. 
Effluent Limitation Guidelines. In September 2015, the EPA issued a final rule revising the ELG for steam electric power generation units. The ELG final rule establishes new or additional requirements for wastewater streams associated with steam electric power generation processes and byproducts. For EGUs greater than 50 MW, the final rule establishes a zero discharge standard for bottom ash transport water, fly ash transport water and flue gas mercury control wastewater. The rule also establishes effluent limits for flue gas desulfurization wastewaters. Various industry and environmental groups have filed petitions for judicial review of the ELG final rule. 
We have evaluated the ELG final rule and at this time, we estimate the cost of our compliance with the ELG rule to be approximately $308 million. The majority of ELG compliance expenditures are expected to occur in the 2017-2023 timeframe. As planning and work progress, we continue to review our estimates as well as timing of our capital expenditures. The following table presents the projected capital expenditures by period for ELG compliance as of December 31, 2016 (does not include Delta Transaction):

(amounts in millions) | Less than1 Year | | 1 - 3 Years | | 3 - 5 Years | | More than5 Years | Total
PJM segment | $ | 11 | | | $ | 45 | | $ | 49 | $ | 40 | $ | 145
MISO segment | 24 | | | 45 | | | — | | — | 69 | 
IPH segment | 6 | | | 88 | | | — | | — | 94 | 
Total ELG expenditures | $ | 41 | | | $ | 178 | | $ | 49 | $ | 40 | $ | 308


NPDES Permits.  We are currently appealing certain requirements in the renewal NPDES permits at several of our facilities, including Joppa and Coffeen. 
In January 2013, the Ohio EPA reissued the NPDES permit for the jointly owned Stuart facility.  The operator of Stuart, The Dayton Power and Light Company, appealed various aspects of the permit, including provisions regarding thermal discharge limitations, to the Ohio Environmental Review Appeals Commission. Depending on the outcome of the appeal, the effects on Stuart’s operations could be material. At this time we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the possible costs, or range of costs, that might be incurred to resolve this matter.
Coal Combustion Residuals
The combustion of coal to generate electric power creates large quantities of ash and byproducts that are managed at power generation facilities in dry form in landfills and in wet form in surface impoundments. Each of our coal-fired plants has at least one Coal Combustion Residuals (“CCR”) surface impoundment. At present, CCR is regulated by the states as solid waste. 
EPA CCR Rule. The EPA’s CCR rule establishes minimum federal criteria that owners or operators of regulated CCR units must meet without the engagement of a state or federal regulatory authority. The CCR rule, which took effect in October 2015, establishes requirements for existing and new CCR landfills and surface impoundments as well as inactive CCR surface impoundments. The requirements include location restrictions, structural integrity criteria, groundwater monitoring, operating criteria, liner design criteria, closure and post-closure care, recordkeeping and notification. The rule allows existing CCR surface impoundments to continue to operate for the remainder of their operating life, but generally would require closure if groundwater monitoring demonstrates that the CCR surface impoundment is responsible for exceedances of groundwater quality protection standards or the CCR surface impoundment does not meet location restrictions or structural integrity criteria. The deadlines for beginning and completing closure vary depending on several factors. Several petitions for judicial review have been filed. 
Pursuant to the CCR rule, we have filed notices of intent with the IEPA to close 13 surface impoundments located at our Baldwin, Hennepin, Wood River, Coffeen and Duck Creek facilities. At this time, we estimate the cost of our compliance will be approximately $234 million with the majority of the expenditures in the 2017-2023 timeframe. This estimate is reflected in our AROs. See Asset Retirement Obligations below for further discussion.
18

Illinois CCR Rule.  In 2013, the IEPA filed a proposed rulemaking with the IPCB that would establish processes governing monitoring, corrective action and closure of CCR surface impoundments at power generating facilities. In July 2016, the IEPA issued a revised proposed rule. The IPCB has stayed the rulemaking proceeding since 2015 to allow consideration of the EPA CCR rule, including the impact of legal and legislative actions concerning that rule. 
MISO Segment Groundwater.  In 2012, the IEPA issued violation notices alleging violations of groundwater standards onsite at our Baldwin and Vermilion facilities. 
At Baldwin, with approval of the IEPA, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of the Baldwin CCR surface impoundment system beginning in 2013. Based on the results of that evaluation, we recommended to the IEPA in 2014 that the closure process for the inactive east CCR surface impoundment begin and that a geotechnical investigation of the existing soil cap on the inactive old east CCR surface impoundment be undertaken. We also submitted a supplemental groundwater modeling report that indicates no known offsite water supply wells will be impacted under the various Baldwin CCR surface impoundment closure scenarios modeled. In 2016, the IEPA approved our closure and post-closure care plans for the Baldwin old east, east, and west fly ash CCR surface impoundments. We are working towards implementation of the closure plan. 
At our retired Vermilion facility, which is not subject to the CCR rule, we submitted proposed corrective action plans for two CCR surface impoundments (i.e., the old east and the north CCR surface impoundments) to the IEPA in 2012. Our hydrogeological investigation indicates that these two CCR surface impoundments impact groundwater quality onsite and that such groundwater migrate offsite to the north of the property and to the adjacent Middle Fork of the Vermilion River.  The proposed corrective action plans recommend closure in place of both CCR surface impoundments and include an application to the IEPA to establish a groundwater management zone while impacts from the facility are mitigated.  In 2014, we submitted a revised corrective action plan for the old east CCR surface impoundment. We await IEPA action on our proposed corrective action plans. Our estimated cost of the recommended closure alternative for both the Vermilion old east and north CCR surface impoundments, including post-closure care, is approximately $10 million. 
If remediation measures concerning groundwater are necessary in the future at either Baldwin or Vermilion, we may incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. At this time we cannot reasonably estimate the costs, or range of costs, of remediation, if any, that ultimately may be required. 
IPH Segment Groundwater.  Groundwater monitoring results indicate that the CCR surface impoundments at each of the IPH segment facilities potentially impact onsite groundwater. In 2012, the IEPA issued violation notices alleging violations of groundwater standards at the Newton and Coffeen facilities’ CCR surface impoundments. In 2015, we submitted an assessment monitoring report to the IEPA that identifies the Newton facility’s inactive unlined landfill as the likely source of groundwater quality exceedances at the facility’s active CCR landfill. In August 2016, IEPA approved the report. We are monitoring groundwater in accordance with IEPA’s approval. 
If remediation measures concerning groundwater are necessary at any of our IPH facilities, IPH may incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. At this time we cannot reasonably estimate the costs, or range of costs, of remediation, if any, that ultimately may be required. 
Dam Safety Assessment Reports. In response to the failure at the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Kingston plant, the EPA initiated a nationwide investigation of the structural integrity of CCR surface impoundments in 2009. The EPA assessments found all of our surface impoundments to be in satisfactory or fair condition, with the exception of the surface impoundments at the Baldwin and Hennepin facilities.
In response to the Hennepin report, we made capital improvements to the Hennepin east CCR surface impoundment berms and notified the EPA of our intent to close the Hennepin west CCR surface impoundment. The preliminary estimated cost for closure of the west CCR surface impoundment, including post-closure monitoring, is approximately $5 million, which is reflected in our AROs. We performed further studies needed to support closure of the west CCR surface impoundment, submitted those studies to the IEPA in 2014 and await IEPA action.
In response to the Baldwin report, we notified the EPA in 2013 of our action plan, which included implementation of recommended operating practices and certain recommended studies. In 2014, we updated the EPA on the status of our Baldwin action plan, including the completion of certain studies and implementation of remedial measures and our ongoing evaluation of potential long-term measures in the context of our concurrent evaluation at Baldwin of groundwater corrective actions. At this time, to resolve the concerns raised in the EPA’s assessment report and as a result of the CCR rule, we plan to initiate closure of the Baldwin west fly ash CCR surface impoundment in 2017, which is reflected in our AROs.

Climate Change
For the last several years, there has been a robust public debate about climate change and the potential for regulations requiring lower emissions of greenhouse gas (“GHG”), primarily carbon dioxide (“CO2” and equivalent carbon dioxide “CO2e”) and methane. Power generating facilities are a major source of GHG emissions. In 2016, our facilities emitted approximately 71 million tons of CO2. The amounts of CO2 emitted from our facilities during any time period will depend upon their dispatch rates during the period. We believe that the focus of any federal program attempting to address climate change should include three critical, interrelated elements: (i) the environment, (ii) the economy and (iii) energy security.
Federal Regulation of GHGs.  The EPA has issued several rules concerning GHGs as directly relevant to our facilities since the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, which held that GHGs meet the definition of a pollutant under the CAA and that regulation of GHG emissions is authorized by the CAA. We have implemented processes and procedures to report our GHG emissions. In 2010, the EPA issued PSD and Title V Permitting Guidance for Greenhouse Gases, which focuses on steam turbine and boiler efficiency improvements as a reasonable best available control technology (“BACT”) requirement for coal-fired EGUs. The EPA’s Tailoring Rule and Timing Rule phased in GHG emissions annual applicability thresholds for the PSD permit program and the Title V operating permit program beginning in 2011. Application of the PSD program to GHG emissions will require implementation of BACT for new and modified major sources of GHG. 
In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, holding that the EPA may not impose PSD or Title V permitting requirements on facilities based solely on emissions of GHGs. The Court also invalidated the EPA’s Tailoring Rule but concluded that the EPA may impose BACT requirements on GHG emissions if a facility is subject to BACT for other pollutants. The Court also determined that the EPA may establish a de minimis threshold below which BACT would not be required for GHG emissions, but left it open to the EPA to justify the appropriate threshold. In October 2016, the EPA proposed to establish a GHG significant emission rate of 75,000 tons per year CO2e for sources that trigger PSD on the basis of their emissions of air pollutants other than GHGs.    
Clean Power Plan. In August 2015, the EPA issued the Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon emissions from existing EGUs.  The EPA also separately issued final rules establishing carbon standards for new, modified and reconstructed EGUs, which include emission standards for new fossil fuel-fired utility boilers based on the performance of a new efficient coal unit implementing partial carbon capture and storage. 
The EPA expects that by 2030 when the Clean Power Plan is fully implemented, CO2 emissions from EGUs will be 32 percent below 2005 levels.  States are required to develop plans to achieve interim CO2 emission rates reductions phased in over the period 2022 to 2029 and the final CO2 rate for their state by 2030.  The state-specific CO2 emission performance rates reflect the EPA’s determination that the best system of emission reduction is comprised of three building blocks: increasing the operational efficiency of existing coal-fired EGUs, shifting electricity generation to natural gas-fired EGUs, and increasing electricity generation from renewable sources. Emission trading programs are permitted. 
Numerous states, industry associations and labor groups filed lawsuits challenging the EPA’s Clean Power Plan. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the rule pending completion of judicial review. Oral argument in the challenges to the Clean Power Plan occurred before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in September 2016. Judicial challenges also have been filed against the EPA’s final rules establishing carbon standards for new, modified and reconstructed EGUs.

The nature and scope of CO2 emission reduction requirements that ultimately may be imposed on our facilities as a result of the EPA’s EGU CO2 reduction rules are uncertain at this time, but may result in significantly increased compliance costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The new Presidential Administration has announced its intent to rescind the Clean Power Plan. We continue to monitor the status of the rule. 
State Regulation of GHGs.  Many states where we operate generation facilities have, are considering, or are in some stage of implementing, state-only regulatory programs intended to reduce emissions of GHGs from stationary sources as a means of addressing climate change.
California. Our assets in California are subject to the California Global Warming Solutions Act (“AB 32”), which required the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) to develop a GHG emission control program to reduce emissions of GHGs in the state to 1990 levels by 2020. In April 2015, the Governor of California issued an executive order establishing a new statewide GHG reduction target of 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 to ensure California meets its 2050 GHG reduction target of 80 percent below 1990 levels. The CARB and the Province of Québec held their ninth joint allowance auction in November 2016 with current vintage auction allowances selling at a clearing price of $12.73 per metric ton and 2019 auction allowances selling at a clearing price of $12.73 per metric ton. The CARB expects allowance prices to be in the $15 to $30 range by 2020. We have participated in quarterly auctions or in secondary markets, as appropriate, to secure allowances for our affected assets. In August 2016, the CARB proposed amendments to its cap-and-trade regulations that would, among other things, extend the program beyond 2020 by establishing declining emission caps through 2030 and linking the program to the new cap-and-trade program in Ontario, Canada beginning in January 2018.
Our generating facilities in California emitted approximately 1 million tons of GHGs during 2016. The cost of GHG allowances required to operate our units in California during 2016 was approximately $15 million.  We estimate the cost of GHG allowances required to operate Moss Landing in California during 2017 will be approximately $17 million; however, we expect that the cost of compliance would be reflected in the power market, and the actual impact to gross margin would be largely offset by an increase in revenue.
RGGI. RGGI, a state-driven GHG emission control program that took effect in 2009 was initially implemented by ten New England and Mid-Atlantic states to reduce CO2 emissions from power plants. The participating RGGI states implemented a cap-and-trade program. Compliance with RGGI can be achieved by reducing emissions, purchasing or trading allowances, or securing offset allowances from an approved offset project. We are required to hold allowances equal to at least 50 percent of emissions in each of the first two years of the three-year control period. In 2016, RGGI held its thirty-fourth auction, in which approximately 15 million allowances were sold at a clearing price of $3.55 per allowance. We have participated in quarterly RGGI auctions or in secondary markets, as appropriate, to secure allowances for our affected assets. We expect any future changes in the price of RGGI allowances to be reflected in both the forward and locational marginal prices for power and be neutral to our gross margin.
Our generating facilities in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, and New York emitted approximately 8 million tons of CO2 during 2016. The cost of RGGI allowances required to operate these facilities during 2016 was approximately $36 million. We estimate the cost of RGGI allowances required to operate our affected facilities during 2017 will be approximately $29 million. While the cost of allowances required to operate our RGGI-affected facilities is expected to increase in future years, we expect that the cost of compliance would be reflected in the power market, and the actual impact to gross margin would be largely offset by an increase in revenue. We expect any future changes in the price of RGGI allowances to be reflected in both the forward and locational marginal prices for power and be neutral to our gross margin.
Massachusetts. In December 2016, Massachusetts proposed rules that would establish an aggregate GHG emission limit for existing and new electricity generating facilities. The proposed rules set facility-specific GHG emissions limits on EGUs, including our Bellingham, Blackstone, Dighton, Masspower and Milford facilities. The emissions limits would take effect beginning in 2018 and the aggregate GHG emission limit would decline each year by 2.5 percent of its 2018 value until 2050. For years 2018-2025, existing facility emissions limits would be determined based on the facility’s average portion of 2013-2015 electrical output. 
Remedial Laws
We are subject to environmental requirements relating to handling and disposal of toxic and hazardous materials, including provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and RCRA and similar state laws. CERCLA imposes strict liability for contributions to contaminated sites resulting from the release of “hazardous substances” into the environment. CERCLA or RCRA could impose remedial obligations with respect to a variety of our facilities and operations.
A number of our older facilities contain quantities of asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paint and/or other regulated materials. Existing state and federal rules require the proper management and disposal of these materials. We have developed a 
21

plan that includes proper maintenance of existing non-friable asbestos installations and removal and abatement of asbestos-containing materials where necessary because of maintenance, repairs, replacement or damage to the asbestos itself.
COMPETITION
The power generation business is a regional business that is diverse in terms of industry structure. Demand for power may be met by generation capacity based on several competing generation technologies, such as natural gas-fired, coal-fired or nuclear generation, as well as power generating facilities fueled by alternative energy sources, including hydro power, synthetic fuels, solar, wind, wood, geothermal, waste heat and solid waste sources. Our power generation business competes with other non-utility generators, regulated utilities, unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities, other energy service companies, including retail power companies, and financial institutions in the regions in which we operate. We believe that our ability to compete effectively in the power generation business will be driven in large part by our ability to achieve and maintain a low cost of production, primarily by managing fuel costs and the reliability of our generating facilities. Our ability to compete effectively will also be impacted by various governmental and regulatory activities designed to reduce GHG emissions and to promote lower emitting generation. For example, regulatory requirements for load-serving entities to acquire a percentage of their energy from renewable-fueled facilities will potentially reduce the demand for energy from coal- and gas-fired facilities, such as those we own and operate. In addition, the extension of federal renewable energy tax credit programs is expected to further expand renewable energy development. Finally, certain of our competitors are set to receive subsidies from the states of New York and Illinois for their otherwise uneconomic nuclear plants. At this time, the direct impact on the organized power markets is a change in the generation supply stack created by the continued operation of subsidized resources that would retire absent the subsidies, specifically in NYISO, PJM and MISO.

EMPLOYEES
At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 340 employees at our corporate headquarters and approximately 2,117 employees at our facilities, including 219 field-based administrative employees who are part of our support and retail functions. Approximately 1,203 employees at our operating facilities are subject to collective bargaining agreements with various unions. In 2016, we reached an agreement to extend the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements with Local 51 representing our Dynegy Midwest Generation, LLC (“DMG”) facilities located in Illinois. Our collective bargaining agreement with IBEW Local 1347, which represents employees at our Miami Fort and Zimmer facilities, expires on April 1, 2017. We anticipate that we will successfully negotiate a new agreement with this union in the coming months. During 2016, the Company did not experience a labor stoppage or a labor dispute at any of its facilities.
