Item 1. Business. 
Overview
Chemical Financial Corporation (the "Corporation"), headquartered in Midland, Michigan, is a financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, that was incorporated in the State of Michigan in August 1973. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol "CHFC." On June 30, 1974, the Corporation acquired Chemical Bank and Trust Company pursuant to a reorganization in which the former shareholders of Chemical Bank and Trust Company became shareholders of the Corporation. Chemical Bank and Trust Company's name was changed to Chemical Bank on December 31, 2005. In this Annual Report, unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to "we," "us," and "our" refer to Chemical Financial Corporation and Chemical Bank.
Since our acquisition of Chemical Bank and Trust Company, we have acquired 25 community banks and 36 other branch bank offices through December 31, 2017. Our most recent transactions include our merger with Talmer Bancorp, Inc. ("Talmer") during the third quarter of 2016 and the acquisitions of Lake Michigan Financial Corporation ("Lake Michigan") and Monarch Community Bancorp, Inc. ("Monarch") during the second quarter of 2015, and the acquisition of Northwestern Bancorp, Inc. ("Northwestern") during the fourth quarter of 2014. These transactions are discussed in more detail under the subheading "Mergers, Acquisitions and Branch Closings" included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in this Annual Report.
Our business is concentrated in a single industry segment, commercial banking, which is conducted through our single commercial bank subsidiary, Chemical Bank. We offer a full range of traditional banking and fiduciary products and services to residents and business customers in our geographical market areas. These products and services include business and personal checking accounts, savings and individual retirement accounts, time deposit instruments, electronically accessed banking products, residential and commercial real estate financing, commercial lending, consumer financing, debit cards, safe deposit box services, money transfer services, automated teller machines, access to insurance and investment products, corporate and personal wealth management services, mortgage banking and other banking services. Chemical Bank operated through an internal organizational structure of seven regional banking units, organized by geography, as of December 31, 2017. In addition, we own, directly or indirectly, various non-bank operating and non-operating subsidiaries.
At December 31, 2017, we had consolidated total assets of $19.28 billion, total loans of $14.16 billion, total deposits of$13.64 billion and shareholders' equity of $2.67 billion. For more information about our financial condition and results of operations, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Annual Report.

Commercial Loan Portfolio
Commercial loans
We offer commercial loans and lines of credit to varying types of businesses, including for profit businesses, municipalities, school districts and nonprofit organizations, for the purpose of supporting working capital and operational needs and term financing of equipment. Our commercial loan portfolio is well diversified across business lines and has no concentration in any one industry. 
In our credit underwriting process, we carefully evaluate the borrower's industry, management skills, operating performance, liquidity and financial condition. We underwrite commercial loans based on a multiple of repayment sources, including operating cash flow, liquidation of collateral and guarantor support, if any. We closely monitor the operating performance, liquidity and financial condition of the borrowers through analysis of required periodic financial statements and meetings with the borrower's management. We generally secure our commercial loans with inventory, accounts receivable, equipment, personal guarantees of the owner or other sources of repayment, although we may also obtain real estate as collateral.
Commercial Real Estate Loans
Our commercial real estate loans include loans that are secured by real estate occupied by the borrower for ongoing operations, non-owner occupied real estate leased to one or more tenants and vacant land that has been acquired for investment or future land development. Commercial real estate loans are subject to the same general risks and additionally are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in the value of real estate and typically involve larger loan balances concentrated in a single borrower. In addition, the payment experience on loans secured by income-producing properties and vacant land loans is typically dependent on the success of the operation of the related project and is typically affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market and in the economy. Fluctuations in the value of real estate, as well as other factors arising after a loan has been made, could negatively affect a borrowerâ€™s cash flow, creditworthiness and ability to repay the loan. When we make new real estate loans, we obtain a security interest in real estate whenever possible, in addition to any other available collateral, to increase the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan. We generally attempt to mitigate the risks associated with commercial real estate loans by, among other things, lending primarily in our market areas, lending across industry lines, not developing a concentration in any one line of business and using prudent loan-to-value ratios in our underwriting process.
Each commercial real estate borrower is evaluated on an individual basis to determine the business risks and credit profile of each borrower and we generally require that a borrower maintain specific debt service covenants. To ensure secondary sources of payment and liquidity to support a loan, we review the financial statements of the operating company and the personal financial statements of the principal owners and may require their personal guarantees.
Real Estate Construction and Land Development Loans
Our real estate construction loans are primarily originated for construction of commercial properties and often convert to a commercial real estate loan at the completion of the construction period. Our land development loans include loans made to developers for the purpose of infrastructure improvements to vacant land to create finished marketable residential and commercial lots/land. A majority of our land development loans consist of loans to develop residential real estate. Land development loans 
5

are generally originated as interest only with the intention that the loan principal balance will be repaid through the sale of finished properties by the developers within twelve months of the completion date.
Real estate construction and land development lending involves a higher degree of risk than commercial real estate lending and residential mortgage lending because of the uncertainties of construction, including the possibility of costs exceeding the initial estimates, the need to obtain a tenant or purchaser of the property if it will not be owner-occupied or the need to sell developed properties. We generally attempt to mitigate the risks associated with real estate construction and land development lending by, among other things, lending primarily in our market areas, using prudent underwriting guidelines and closely monitoring the construction process. 
Consumer Loan Portfolio
Residential Mortgage
Our residential mortgage loans consist primarily of one- to four-family residential loans with fixed interest rates of 15 years or less, with amortization periods generally from 15 to 30 years. The loan-to-value ratio at the time of origination is generally 80% or less. Loans with more than an 80% loan-to-value ratio generally require private mortgage insurance. Residential mortgage loans also include loans to consumers for the construction of single family residences that are secured by these properties. 
The mortgage loans that we originate to be held by us in our portfolio have generally been priced competitively with current market rates for such loans. We currently offer a number of ARM loans with terms of up to 30 years and interest rates that adjust at scheduled intervals based on the product selected. These interest rates can adjust annually, or remain fixed for an initial period of three, five or seven years and thereafter adjust annually. The interest rates for ARM loans are generally indexed to the one-year U.S. Treasury Index or the one year LIBOR rate. The ARM loans generally provide for periodic (not more than 2%) and overall (not more than 6%) caps on the increase or decrease in the interest rate at any adjustment date and over the life of the loan.
Because the majority of loans originated and retained in the residential portfolio are adjustable-rate one- to four-family mortgage loans, we limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest income due to rising interest rates. However, adjustable-rate loans generally pose credit risks not inherent in fixed-rate loans, primarily because as interest rates rise, the underlying payments of the borrower rise, thereby increasing the potential for default. Periodic and lifetime caps on interest rate increases help to reduce the credit risks associated with adjustable-rate loans but also limit the interest rate sensitivity of such loans. We require that adjustable-rate loans held in the loan portfolio have payments sufficient to amortize the loan over its term and the loans do not have negative principal amortization.
Consumer Installment
Our consumer installment loans consist of relatively small loan amounts to consumers to finance personal items (primarily automobiles, recreational vehicles and marine vehicles) and are comprised primarily of indirect loans purchased from dealerships. We originate consumer installment loans utilizing a computer-based credit scoring analysis to supplement the underwriting process. Consumer rates are both fixed and variable, with negotiable terms. Our consumer installment loans typically amortize over periods up to 60 months. Although we typically require monthly payments of interest and a portion of the principal on our loan products, we may offer consumer loans with a single maturity date when a specific source of repayment is available. Consumer loans not secured by real estate are generally considered to have greater risk than first or second mortgages on real estate because they may be unsecured, or, if they are secured, the value of the collateral may be difficult to assess and more likely to decrease in value, and is more difficult to control, than real estate.
Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit
Our home equity loans and lines of credit are comprised of loans to consumers who utilize equity in their personal residence, including junior lien mortgages, as collateral to secure the loan or line-of-credit. The majority of our home equity lines of credit are comprised of loans with payments of interest only and original maturities of up to ten years. These home equity lines of credit include junior lien mortgages whereby the first lien mortgage is held by a nonaffiliated financial institution. We also originate home equity loans utilizing a computer-based credit scoring analysis to supplement the underwriting process. 
Mortgage Banking Activity
Sale of Residential Real Estate Loans
We engage in mortgage banking as part of an overall strategy to deliver loan products to customers. As a result, we sell a large portion of the residential loans we originate to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or, to a lesser extent, private investors, while 
6

typically retaining the rights to provide loan servicing to our customers. As part of our overall asset/liability management strategic objectives, we may also originate and retain certain adjustable-rate residential loans. To reduce the interest rate risk associated with commitments made to borrowers for mortgage loans that have not yet been closed and that we intend to sell in the secondary markets, we routinely enter into commitments to sell loans or mortgage-backed securities, considered to be derivatives, to limit our exposure to potential movements in market interest rates. We monitor our interest rate risk position daily to maintain appropriate coverage of our loan commitments made to borrowers.
We use derivative instruments to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with commitments to make mortgage loans that we intend to sell. We also enter into contracts for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans in order to economically hedge potential adverse effects of changes in interest rates. These contracts are also derivative instruments. Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities.
Loan Servicing
We service residential and commercial mortgage loans for investors under contracts where we receive a fee for performing mortgage servicing activities on mortgage loans that are not owned by us and are not included on our balance sheet. This process involves collecting monthly mortgage payments on behalf of investors, reporting information to those investors on a timely basis and maintaining custodial escrow accounts for the payment of principal and interest to investors, and property taxes and insurance premiums on behalf of borrowers. 
As compensation for our mortgage servicing activities, we receive weighted average servicing fees of approximately 0.25% per year of the loan balances serviced, plus any late charges collected from the delinquent borrowers and other fees incidental to the services provided, offset by applicable subservicing fees. In the event of a default by the borrower, we receive no servicing fees until the default is cured. In times when interest rates are rising or at high levels, servicing mortgage loans can represent a steady source of noninterest income and can, at times, offset decreases in mortgage banking gains. Conversely, in times when interest rates are falling or at very low levels, servicing mortgage loans can become comparatively less profitable due to the rapid payoff of loans and the negative impact due to the change in fair value of the asset. We account for our mortgage servicing rights at fair value. The amount of mortgage servicing rights initially recorded is based on the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights determined on the date when the underlying loan is sold. Our determination of fair value and the amount we record is based on a valuation model using discounted cash-flow analysis and available market pricing. Third party valuations of the mortgage servicing rights portfolio are obtained on a regular basis and are used to determine the fair value of the servicing rights at the end of the reporting period. Estimates of fair value reflect the following variables:

â€¢ | anticipated prepayment speeds;


â€¢ | product type (i.e., conventional, government, balloon);


â€¢ | fixed or adjustable rate of interest;


â€¢ | interest rate;


â€¢ | servicing costs per loan;


â€¢ | discounted yield rate;


â€¢ | estimate of ancillary income; and


â€¢ | geographic location of the loan.

We monitor the level of our investment in mortgage servicing rights in relation to our other mortgage banking activities in order to limit our exposure to significant fluctuations in loan servicing income. Nonetheless, we remain exposed to significant potential volatility in the value of our mortgage servicing rights. Accordingly, in the future, we may sell mortgage servicing rights depending on a variety of factors, including capital sufficiency, the size of the mortgage servicing rights portfolio relative to total assets and current market conditions.
Credit Administration and Loan Review
Certain credit risks are inherent in making loans. These include repayment risks, risks resulting from uncertainties in the future value of collateral, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers. We attempt to mitigate repayment risks by adhering to internal credit policies and procedures. We employ consistent analysis and underwriting to examine credit information and prepare underwriting documentation. We monitor and approve exceptions to policy as required, and we also track and address technical exceptions.
Wealth Management
We offer services through the Wealth Management department of Chemical Bank. These services include investment management and custodial services; trust services; financial and estate planning; and retirement planning and employee benefit 
7

programs. The Wealth Management department earns revenue largely from fees based on the market value of those assets under management, which can fluctuate as the market fluctuates. The Wealth Management department had assets under custodial and management arrangements of $5.13 billion at December 31, 2017, $4.41 billion at December 31, 2016 and $3.71 billion at December 31, 2015. The Wealth Management department also sells investment products (largely annuity products and mutual funds) through its Chemical Financial Advisors program. Customer assets within the Chemical Financial Advisors program were $1.31 billion at December 31, 2017, $1.15 billion at December 31, 2016 and $0.87 billion at December 31, 2015. 
Deposit Products
We offer a full range of deposit services that are typically available from most banks and savings institutions, including checking accounts, commercial accounts, savings accounts and other time deposits of various types, ranging from daily money market accounts to longer-term certificates of deposit. Transaction accounts and time deposits are tailored to and offered at rates competitive with those offered in our primary market areas. In addition, we offer certain retirement account services. We solicit accounts from individuals, businesses, associations, organizations and governmental authorities. We believe that our significant branch network will assist us in continuing to attract deposits from local customers in our market areas.
Employees
At December 31, 2017, we had approximately 3,000 full-time equivalent employees. 
Competition 
The business of banking is highly competitive. The principal methods of competition for financial services are price (interest rates paid on deposits, interest rates charged on loans and fees charged for services) and service (convenience and quality of services rendered to customers). In addition to competition from other commercial banks, we face significant competition from non-bank financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, insurance companies and investment firms. Credit unions and finance companies are particularly significant competitors in the consumer loan market. The financial services industry has become more competitive as technology advances have lowered barriers to entry, enabling more companies, including nonbank companies, to provide financial services. Technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial institutions. Mergers and acquisitions have also led to increased concentration in the banking industry, placing added competitive pressure on our core banking products and services as we see competitors enter some of our markets or offer similar products. We also compete for deposits with a broad range of other types of investments, including mutual funds and annuities. 
The growth of our deposits can be impacted by competition from other investment products, such as mutual funds and various annuity products. These investment products are sold by a wide spectrum of organizations, such as brokerage and insurance companies, as well as by financial institutions. In response to the competition for other investment products, we, through our Chemical Financial Advisors program, offer a wide array of mutual funds, annuity products and marketable securities through an alliance with an independent, registered broker/dealer. We also compete with credit unions in most of our markets. These institutions are challenging competitors, as credit unions are exempt from federal income taxes, allowing them to potentially offer higher deposit rates. 
Mergers, Acquisitions, Consolidations and Divestitures
Our current strategy for growth includes strengthening our presence in core markets, expanding into contiguous markets and broadening our product offerings, while taking into account the integration and other risks of growth. We evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities in connection with possible transactions. As a result, discussions, and in some cases, negotiations and transactions may take place and future acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur, including future acquisitions that may extend beyond contiguous markets. These generally involve payment of a premium over book value and current market price, and therefore, dilution of book value per share will likely occur with any future transaction.

Supervision and Regulation 
Chemical Financial Corporation and Chemical Bank are subject to extensive supervision and regulation under various federal and state laws and regulations. The supervisory and regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of shareholders and creditors. 
Banks are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations that have a material impact on their business. These include, among others, minimum capital requirements, state usury laws, state laws relating to fiduciaries, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act), the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the U.S.A. PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, Office of Foreign Assets Controls regulations, electronic funds transfer laws, redlining laws, predatory lending laws, laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts or practices, antitrust laws, environmental laws, anti-money laundering laws and privacy laws. These laws and regulations can have a significant effect on the operating and financial results of banks. 
A summary of significant elements of some of the laws, regulations and regulatory policies applicable to the Corporation and Chemical Bank follows below. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies that are described. The following discussion is not intended to be a complete list of all of the activities regulated by the banking laws or of the impact of those laws and regulations on our operations. It is intended only to briefly summarize some material provisions. These statutes, regulations and policies are continually subject to review by Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. Changes in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects. Our operations may be affected by legislative changes and the policies of various regulatory authorities. We cannot predict the effect that fiscal or monetary policies, economic conditions or new federal or state legislation may have on our business and earnings in the future.
Regulatory Agencies
The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from Chemical Bank. The Corporation is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board ("FRB") as a financial holding company and a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 ("BHC Act"). The BHC Act provides for general regulation of financial holding companies by the FRB and functional regulation of banking activities by banking regulators. The Corporation is also under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Corporation's common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Stock MarketÂ® ("NASDAQ") under the symbol CHFC and is subject to the NASDAQ Listing Rules. 
Chemical Bank is chartered by the State of Michigan and supervised, examined and regulated by the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services ("DIFS"). Chemical Bank, as a member of the Federal Reserve System, is also supervised, examined and regulated by the FRB. Chemical Bank is also subject to regulation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has responsibility for enforcing the principal federal consumer protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Truth in Savings Act, among others, for institutions that have assets in excess of $10 billion. Deposits of Chemical Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") to the maximum extent provided by law. 
Bank Holding Company Activities
In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the FRB has determined to be closely related to the business of banking. In addition, bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be financial holding companies may engage in any activities that are financial in nature or complementary 
9

to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system without prior approval of the FRB. Activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments. 
In order for the Corporation to maintain financial holding company status, both the Corporation and Chemical Bank must be categorized as "well-capitalized" and "well-managed" under applicable regulatory guidelines. If the Corporation or Chemical Bank ceases to meet these requirements, the FRB may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements and place limitations on the Corporation's ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies. In addition, if the deficiencies persist, the FRB may require the Corporation to divest of Chemical Bank. The Corporation and Chemical Bank were both categorized as "well-capitalized" and "well-managed" as of December 31, 2017.
The BHC Act requires prior approval of the FRB for any direct or indirect acquisition of more than 5% of the voting shares of a commercial bank or its parent holding company by the Corporation. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined organization, the Corporation's performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 ("CRA"), the Corporation's adherence to banking regulations and fair lending laws and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities. 
Interstate Banking and Branching
Bank holding companies may acquire banks located in any state in the United States without regard to geographic restrictions or reciprocity requirements imposed by state law. Banks may establish interstate branch networks through acquisitions of other banks. The establishment of de novo interstate branches or the acquisition of individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) is allowed to the extent that state law would permit a bank chartered in that state to establish such a branch. 
Michigan permits both U.S. and non-U.S. banks to establish branch offices in Michigan. The Michigan Banking Code permits, in appropriate circumstances and with the approval of the DIFS, (1) acquisition of Michigan banks by FDIC-insured banks, savings banks or savings and loan associations located in other states, (2) sale by a Michigan bank of branches to an FDIC-insured bank, savings bank or savings and loan association located in a state in which a Michigan bank could purchase branches of the purchasing entity, (3) consolidation of Michigan banks and FDIC-insured banks, savings banks or savings and loan associations located in other states having laws permitting such consolidation, (4) establishment of branches in Michigan by FDIC-insured banks located in other states, the District of Columbia or U.S. territories or protectorates having laws permitting a Michigan bank to establish a branch in such jurisdiction, and (5) establishment by foreign banks of branches located in Michigan. A Michigan bank holding company may acquire a non-Michigan bank and a non-Michigan bank holding company may acquire a Michigan bank. 
Dividends
The Corporation's primary source of funds available to pay dividends to shareholders is from dividends paid to it by Chemical Bank. Federal and state banking laws and regulations limit both the extent to which Chemical Bank can lend or otherwise supply funds to the Corporation and also place certain restrictions on the amount of dividends Chemical Bank may pay to the Corporation. 
The Corporation and Chemical Bank are subject to regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital above regulatory minimums, which could prohibit the payment of dividends under circumstances where the payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Chemical Bank is required to obtain prior approval from the FRB for the declaration and payment of dividends to the Corporation if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year will exceed the total of (i) Chemical Bank's net income (as defined by regulation) for that year plus (ii) the retained net income (as defined by regulation) for the preceding two years. In addition, federal regulatory authorities have stated that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. Further, the FRB has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. Chemical Bank declared and paid dividends to the Corporation of $165.0 million and $110.5 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Corporation utilized proceeds from the dividend from Chemical Bank in 2016 to fund a portion of the cash component of the merger consideration in the Talmer transaction. The Corporation utilized a portion of the proceeds from the dividend from Chemical Bank in 2015 to pay off subordinated debentures, which were acquired as part of the Lake Michigan transaction, during the first quarter of 2016. Dividends received from Chemical Bank in the past are not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be paid or available to be paid in the future.

Source of Strength
Under FRB policy, the Corporation is expected to act as a source of financial strength to Chemical Bank and to commit resources to support Chemical Bank. In addition, if DIFS deems Chemical Bank's capital to be impaired, DIFS may require Chemical Bank to restore its capital by a special assessment on the Corporation as Chemical Bank's only shareholder. If the Corporation failed to pay any assessment, the Corporation's directors would be required, under Michigan law, to sell the shares of Chemical Bank's stock owned by the Corporation to the highest bidder at either a public or private auction and use the proceeds of the sale to restore Chemical Bank's capital. 
Capital Requirements
The Corporation and Chemical Bank are subject to regulatory "risk-based" capital guidelines. Failure to meet these capital guidelines could subject the Corporation or Chemical Bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting brokered deposits, and other restrictions on its business. In addition, Chemical Bank would generally not receive regulatory approval of any application that requires the consideration of capital adequacy, such as a branch or merger application, unless it could demonstrate a reasonable plan to meet the capital requirement within a reasonable period of time. 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act ("FDICIA") requires, among other things, federal banking agencies to take "prompt corrective action" in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA sets forth the following five capital categories: "well-capitalized," "adequately-capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly-undercapitalized" and "critically-undercapitalized." A depository institution's capital category will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures as established by regulation, which include Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratio measures and a leverage capital ratio measure. 
Federal banking regulators are required to take specified mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. Subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must generally appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. An institution in any of the undercapitalized categories is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from paying any dividends, increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches, accepting or renewing any brokered deposits or engaging in any new line of business, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with FDIC approval. 
In July 2013, the FRB and the FDIC approved final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's (BCBS) capital guidelines for U.S. banks (commonly known as Basel III). Under Basel III, which began for the Corporation and Chemical Bank on January 1, 2015 and are subject to a phase-in period through January 1, 2019, minimum capital requirements were increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Corporation and Chemical Bank. Basel III added a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CET ratio) of 4.5% and a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which when fully phased-in, effectively results in a minimum CET ratio of 7.0%. Basel III also raised the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0% (which, with the capital conservation buffer, effectively results in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% when fully phased-in) and requires a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%.
A summary of the actual and minimum Basel III regulatory capital ratios for the Corporation and Chemical Bank as of December 31, 2017 follows:

 | Leverage Ratio | Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio | Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio | Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio
Actual Capital Ratios: | | | | 
Chemical Financial Corporation | 8.3% | 10.2% | 10.2% | 11.0% 
Chemical Bank | 8.4% | 10.3% | 10.3% | 11.0% 
Minimum for capital adequacy purposes | 4.0% | 4.5% | 6.0% | 8.0% 
Minimum to be well capitalized under prompt corrective action regulations | 5.0% | 6.5% | 8.0% | 10.0% 
Minimum for capital adequacy, including capital conservation buffer(1) | 4.0% | 7.0% | 8.5% | 10.5% 


(1) | Assumes fully phased in capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The capital conservation buffer will be phased in beginning January1, 2016 at 0.625% and increasing by the same amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. Failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer may limit the Corporation's and Chemical Bank's ability to pay dividends or discretionary bonuses, among other things.

At December 31, 2017, the capital ratios of the Corporation and Chemical Bank exceeded the regulatory guidelines for institutions to be categorized as "well-capitalized." Under certain circumstances, the appropriate banking agency may treat a well- capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category. Additional information on the Corporation and Chemical Bank's capital ratios may be found under Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report.
FDIC Insurance
The FDIC formed the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (Reform Act). The FDIC implemented the Reform Act to create a stronger and more stable insurance system. The FDIC maintains the insurance reserves of the DIF by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium. The DIF insures deposit accounts of Chemical Bank up to a maximum amount per separately insured depositor. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the maximum amount of federal deposit insurance coverage permanently increased from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor, per institution. 
FDIC insured depository institutions are required to pay deposit insurance premiums based on an insured depository institutionâ€™s assessment base, calculated as its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity. Chemical Bankâ€™s current annualized premium assessments can range from $0.15 to $0.40 for each $100 of its assessment base. The rate charged depends on Chemical Bankâ€™s performance on the FDICâ€™s "large and highly complex institution" risk-assessment scorecard, which includes factors such as Chemical Bankâ€™s regulatory rating, its ability to withstand asset and funding-related stress, and the relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of Chemical Bankâ€™s failure. The Corporation's FDIC DIF insurance premiums were $11.2 million in 2017, compared to $7.4 million in 2016 and $5.5 million in 2015.
In March 2016, the FDIC adopted rules to impose a surcharge, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, on the quarterly deposit insurance assessments of insured depository institutions having total consolidated assets of at least $10 billion (like Chemical Bank). The surcharge would begin the calendar quarter after the DIF reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.15% and would continue through the quarter that it first reaches or exceeds 1.35%. Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC began to assess large institution surcharges under this new rule. Large banks will pay a quarterly surcharge, in addition to regular assessments, equal to an annual rate of 4.5 basis points. The assessment base for the surcharge will be a large bank's regular assessment base reduced by $10 billion (and subject to adjustment for affiliated banks). The surcharge will remain in place through the quarter that the DIF reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.35%, but no later than December 31, 2018. If the DIF reserve ratio has not reached 1.35% by that date, the FDIC will impose a shortfall assessment on large banks in the first quarter of 2019, and collect it on June 30, 2019.
Safety and Soundness Standards
As required by FDICIA, the federal banking agencies' prompt corrective action powers impose progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. These actions can include: requiring an insured depository institution to adopt a capital restoration plan guaranteed by the institution's parent company; placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities, including restrictions on transactions with affiliates; restricting the interest rates the institution may pay on deposits; prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; prohibiting the holding company from making capital distributions without prior regulatory approval; and, ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution. 
The federal banking agencies also have adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, and compensation and benefits. The federal regulatory agencies may take action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards. 
Depositor Preference
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the "liquidation or other resolution" of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC on behalf of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including depositors whose deposits are payable only outside of the United States and the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.
The Dodd-Frank Act
The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States, including establishing the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") and requiring the CFPB and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations. The CFPB has issued significant new 
12

regulations, which became effective in January 2014, that impact consumer mortgage lending and servicing. In addition, the CFPB has issued regulations, which became effective October 1, 2015, that change the disclosure requirements and forms used under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. Compliance with these new laws and regulations and other regulations under consideration by the CFPB have and will likely result in additional costs and could change the products and/or services that are currently being offered, which could be significant and could adversely impact the Corporation's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
Enhanced Prudential Standards
A publicly traded bank holding company with $10 billion or more in consolidated assets must comply with certain provisions of the Federal Reserve's enhanced prudential standards (EPS). The holding company is required to establish a stand-alone, board level risk committee that must have a formal written charter approved by the board of directors. The risk committee is charged with approving and periodically reviewing the risk-management policies of the company and overseeing the operation of its global risk-management framework. The Corporation has a Standing Risk Management Committee of the board of directors.
Stress Tests
The Dodd-Frank Act mandates company-run stress tests requirements for U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $10 billion to $50 billion. The Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test ("DFAST") require bank holding companies to assess the potential impact of three macroeconomic scenarios - baseline, adverse, and seriously adverse - on the company's consolidated losses, revenues, balance sheet (including risk-weighted assets) and capital. The rules also require each banking organization to establish and maintain a system of controls, oversight and documentation, including policies and procedures, designed to ensure that the DFAST procedures used by the banking organization are effective in meeting the requirements of the rules. Chemical will be required to submit a stress test report in 2018.
The Durbin Amendment
The Dodd-Frank Act included provisions that require that interchange fees in debit card transactions be "reasonable and proportionate" in relation to the cost of the transaction incurred by the card issuer (the "Durbin Amendment"). Under rules issued by the Federal Reserve, interchange fees on a debit card transaction are capped at $0.21 per transaction plus five basis points multiplied by that amount of the transaction are conclusively determined to be reasonable and proportionate. In addition, an issuer may charge up to 1 cent on each debit card transaction as a fraud prevention adjustment if the issuer meets certain fraud prevention standards. The interchange fee restrictions in the Durbin Amendment apply to debit card issuers with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. Chemical Bank became subject to these interchange restrictions beginning on January 1, 2017.
The Volcker Rule
The Volcker Rule implements Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Volcker Rule prohibits "banking entities," such as the Corporation, Chemical Bank and their affiliates and subsidiaries, from owning, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds (referred to as "covered funds") and engaging in short-term proprietary trading of securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options on these instruments.
The Volcker Rule excepts certain transactions from the general prohibition against proprietary trading, including transactions in government securities (e.g., U.S. Treasuries or any instruments issued by the GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC, a Federal Home Loan Bank, or any state or a political division of any state, among others); transactions in connection with underwriting or market-making activities; and, transactions as a fiduciary on behalf of customers. Banking entities may also engage in risk-mitigating hedges if the entity can demonstrate that the hedge reduces or mitigates a specific, identifiable risk or aggregate risk position of the entity. The banking entity is required to conduct an analysis supporting its hedging strategy and the effectiveness of the hedges must be monitored and, if necessary, adjusted on an ongoing basis. Banking entities with more than $50 billion in total consolidated assets and liabilities that engage in permitted trading transactions are required to implement enhanced compliance programs, to regularly report data on trading activities to the regulators, and to provide a CEO attestation that the entityâ€™s compliance program is reasonably designed to comply with the Volcker Rule.
Although the Volcker Rule became effective on April 1, 2014, the Federal Reserve exercised its unilateral authority to extend the compliance deadline until July 21, 2017, with respect to covered funds. This period has ended and the Corporation, Chemical Bank and their affiliates and subsidiaries must be in compliance with the Volcker Rule.

Community Reinvestment Act 
Banks are subject to the provisions of the CRA. Under the terms of the CRA, the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency is required, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess such bank's record in meeting the credit needs of the community served by that bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of "outstanding," "satisfactory," "needs to improve," or "substantial non-compliance." The regulatory agency's assessment of the bank's record is made available to the public. Further, a bank's federal regulatory agency is required to assess the CRA compliance record of any bank that has applied to: (1) obtain deposit insurance coverage for a newly chartered institution, (2) establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, (3) relocate an office, or (4) merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution. In the case of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or another bank holding company, the FRB will assess the CRA compliance record of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank holding company, and such compliance records may be the basis for denying the application. Upon receiving notice that a subsidiary bank is rated less than "satisfactory," a financial holding company will be prohibited from additional activities that are permitted to a financial holding company and from acquiring any company engaged in such activities. Chemical Bank's CRA rating was "outstanding" as of December 31, 2017.
Loans to One Borrower
Under the Home Owners Loan Act ("HOLA"), savings associations are generally subject to the national bank limits on loans to one borrower. Generally, savings associations may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15 percent of the institutionâ€™s unimpaired capital and surplus (as defined by HOLA). Additional amounts may be loaned if such loans or extensions of credit are secured by readily-marketable collateral, but in no case may they be in excess of an additional 10 percent of unimpaired capital and surplus. We have established an internal lending threshold that is more conservative than the limits required by HOLA.
Financial Privacy
Federal banking regulations limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. 
Chemical Bank is also subject to regulatory guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information. These guidelines describe the federal banking agenciesâ€™ expectation for the creation, implementation and maintenance of an information security program, which would include administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities. The standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.
Anti-Money Laundering and the USA Patriot Act
A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 ("BSA") and subsequent laws and regulations require the bank to take steps to prevent the use of the bank or its systems to facilitate the flow of illegal or illicit money or terrorist funds. Those requirements include ensuring effective board and management oversight, establishing policies and procedures, performing comprehensive risk assessments, developing effective monitoring and reporting capabilities, ensuring adequate training and establishing a comprehensive independent audit of BSA compliance activities. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (USA Patriot Act) substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The United States Treasury Department has issued, and in some cases proposed, a number of regulations that apply various requirements of the USA Patriot Act to financial institutions. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Certain of those regulations impose specific due diligence requirements on financial institutions that maintain correspondent or private banking relationships with non-U.S. financial institutions or persons. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution.

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
The United States Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. OFAC sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions on "U.S. persons" engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences. 
Incentive Compensation
The regulatory agencies have issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization's incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization's ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization's board of directors. 
The FRB reviews, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Corporation, that are not "large, complex banking organizations." The findings will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization's supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization's ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization's safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
