Item 1. Business.
Overview
 ASV Holdings, Inc. (formerly A.S.V., LLC) (referred to herein as “ASV,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” and/or “us”) designs and manufactures a broad range of high quality compact track loader (“CTL”) and skid steer loader (“SSL”) equipment, marketed through a distribution network in North America, Australia and New Zealand under the ASV brand. We also serve as a private label original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) for several manufacturers.  Our products are used principally in the construction, agricultural and forestry industries. As a full-service manufacturer, we provide pre- and post-sale dealer support, after-sale technical support and replacement parts supplied from our dedicated logistics center. We also supply a limited version of our assembled undercarriage sets that exclude the suspension to Caterpillar for three versions of Caterpillar’s multi-terrain CTL machines marketed under the CAT brand under a supply contract with Caterpillar.
Background:
 A.S.V., Inc. was founded in 1983 and launched its first CTL machine in 1990. It launched as a publicly-traded company on Nasdaq in 1994 and operated as a public company until it was acquired by Terex Corporation (“Terex”) on March 3, 2008. On December 19, 2014, Manitex International, Inc. (“Manitex”) purchased 51% of ASV from Terex pursuant to a joint venture arrangement with Terex (the “Joint Venture”). On December 23, 2014, A.S.V., Inc. was converted to a Minnesota limited liability company and its name was changed to A.S.V., LLC. The terms of the Joint Venture and objectives of ASV management included the following:

• | We agreed to operate as a private label original equipment manufacturer of ASV products under the Terex brand name, and Terex agreed to market the ASV products through the Terex distribution network.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We were permitted to re-launch the ASV brand and establish an independent ASV North American dealer network managed directly by dedicated ASV regional account sales managers. Our independent dealers would be located in areas where Terex had no presence and would therefore be complementary to the Terex network. Terex would provide marketing and product line management resources to support the ASV brand.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We agreed to directly manage our master distributor and overseas dealers in Australia and New Zealand, and national accounts such as Caterpillar.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Terex agreed to support ASV’s efforts to penetrate large rental equipment dealers by utilizing the wider Terex group dealer relationships.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We would continue to convert our ASV products to the Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) Tier 4 Final emissions standard, which are a set of emissions requirements established by the EPA to reduce emissions of particulate matter, oxides of nitrogen and air toxics from certain types of engines.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Since the inception of the Joint Venture in December 2014, we have achieved the following:
  
• | Beginning in the second quarter of 2015, we re-launched the ASV brand with a new logo and newly designed product range of four CTLs and four SSL machines. As of December 31, 2017, we are marketing 12 CTL and SSL products under the ASV brand.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have established our own sales organization, with a National Sales Manager for North America, seven ASV sales account managers and 130 North American ASV dealers and rental accounts with 222 locations in 41 U.S. states and five Canadian provinces as of December 31, 2017.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have grown the ASV distribution network while seeing a decline in activity from dealers in the Terex network. During 2016, 71% of our machine sales were made through our distribution network while 29% of our machine sales were made through Terex dealers. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 97% of our machine sales were made through our distribution network and 3% through Terex distribution.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 On May 11, 2017, in connection with the Company’s initial public offering (“IPO”), we converted from a Minnesota limited liability company into a Delaware corporation and changed our name from A.S.V., LLC to ASV Holdings, Inc., which we refer to herein as the “LLC Conversion”. In conjunction with the LLC Conversion,
  
• | all of our outstanding units converted into shares of our common stock, based on the relative ownership interests of our pre-IPO equity holders as set forth in the A.S.V., LLC limited liability company agreement;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | we adopted and filed a certificate of incorporation and certificate of conversion with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we adopted and filed a plan of conversion and articles of conversion with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota.

Business Outlook 
 A number of economic indicators that we believe are relevant to our industry and products have been trending favorably in 2017 and are forecasted to continue in a positive direction. A primary driver of demand for our CTL and SSL products is the United States housing market, where the level of new housing starts continues to be below pre-2007 levels. Since 2009, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, new housing starts have incrementally increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.3 million units in January 2018 from approximately 0.5 million in October 2009.  This January 2018 rate is 9.7% above the December 2017 rate.
 Construction spending in the United States is also experiencing growth. The U.S. Census Bureau reported on February 1, 2018, that total construction spending during December 2017 was estimated at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.3 trillion, 2.6% above the December 2016 estimate. 
 The equipment rental industry forecasts growth to nearly $60 billion by 2021, according to its ARA Rental Market Monitor, published on February 19, 2018, and investment in rental equipment is projected to increase by 3.1% in 2018 and 8.8% in 2019.
 The economies of the markets to which we sell our products have for the past few years operated with interest rates at historically low levels. Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures which in turn affects sales of our products that serve these activities. Interest rate changes also affect the ability of dealers to finance machine purchases, can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products. In the United States, during 2016 and 2017, the Federal Reserve began increasing interest rates from their historically low levels. Increases in interest rates could negatively impact our sales and create supply chain inefficiencies.
 Factors Affecting Revenues and Gross Profit
 We derive most of our revenue from purchase orders from dealers and distributors and our two largest customers accounted for 32% and 36% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The demand for our products depends upon the general economic conditions of the markets in which we compete, residential housing starts, general construction activity and upon dealer and end-user replacement or repair cycles. Adverse economic conditions may cause dealers or end-users to forego or postpone new purchases in favor of repairing existing machinery. In addition to the United States, we sell to dealers in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. All of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies may have a negative impact on sales volume and sales prices to dealers outside of the United States.
 Factors that affect gross profit include product mix, production levels and cost of raw materials. Margins tend to increase when sales are skewed towards larger, tracked machines and replacement parts. As a consequence, gross profit margins can vary from period to period. Replacement parts generally command higher margins than product sales.
 For further information on our revenues, profits and losses and total assets, see the audited financial statements and notes starting on page F-1 of this Annual Report. 
 Backlog
 The Company’s backlog as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, was $12.7 million and $6.9 million, respectively, and is based upon the value of received orders. 
 Competition
 In all markets, we compete on the basis of product performance, customer service, quality and price. From time to time, the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region. Such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit. 
Raw Materials and Component Products
 
The Company’s operating philosophy is to design, source, integrate, quantitatively assess, assemble, ship and integrate product from parts and systems available from third parties. Consequently, we purchase a majority of our components as partially and fully finished
 2

assemblies, rather than raw materials for conversion. However, steel is a major component of the chassis, cabs and wheel rims of our product and as such availability and pricing from our suppliers is subject to the global steel market. Some components may not be easily interchanged with components from alternative suppliers and have been designed into our products. For example, our engine strategy is to utilize a small number of suppliers such as Kubota, Perkins, Cummins and Deutz. During 2016 we introduced strategic supply chain management to increase focus on sourcing components and to proactively manage our supply base. This broadens and increases responsibility from a solely purchasing function with anticipated benefits in both delivered quality and cost of components that we purchase.
 

Patents, Trademarks and Trade Secrets
 
Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain certain proprietary technologies used in our principal products. We generally rely on patent, trade secret and copyright laws as well as confidentiality agreements with other parties to protect our technologies. We believe that we have patent protection relating to certain existing products, specifically with respect to our proprietary Posi-Track undercarriage and suspension. We may also apply for and receive patent protection for our products in the future. We own or have rights to various trademark registrations and trademark registration applications in the United States that we use in connection with our business. The Company has and will continue to dedicate technical resources toward the further development of our products and processes in order to maintain its competitive position.
Environmental Matters
 
We generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes in the normal course of our manufacturing operations. As a result, we are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern actions that may have adverse environmental effects and require compliance with certain practices when handling and disposing of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes.
Research and Development
 
Research and development expense was $2.1 million or 1.7% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2.0 million or 1.9% of net sales for the same period in 2016. The increase of $.01 million is attributable to expenditures related to the launch of new product designs for the ASV brand in connection with the implementation of the Tier IV emissions standards during the period.
Employment
 
As of December 31, 2017, we employed 156 people on a full-time basis.
