ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Unless otherwise indicated, all references to “Supervalu,” “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relate to SUPERVALU INC. and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. All dollar and share amounts in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are in millions, except per share data and where otherwise noted.
Business Overview
Supervalu is the largest public company grocery distributor to wholesale customers across the United States through its Wholesale segment, operates five retail grocery banners in six geographic regions through its Retail segment and provides professional service solutions to retail operators and other entities, the results of which are included within Wholesale or Corporate depending on the customer type. Supervalu leverages its distribution operations by providing wholesale distribution and logistics service solutions to wholesale customers as well as wholesale distribution to Supervalu’s Retail stores. SUPERVALU INC., a Delaware corporation, was organized in 1925 as the successor to two wholesale grocery firms established in the 1870s.
Supervalu’s business is classified by management into two reportable segments: Wholesale and Retail. These reportable segments are two distinct businesses. The Wholesale reportable segment derives revenues from wholesale distribution of groceries and other products, logistics services and professional service solutions to retail stores and other customers (collectively referred to as “wholesale customers”). The Retail reportable segment derives revenues from the sale of groceries and other products at retail locations operated by Supervalu. Substantially all of Supervalu’s operations are domestic.
Supervalu operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with its fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in February. All references to fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 relate to the 52-week fiscal year ended February 25, 2017, the 52-week fiscal year ended February 27, 2016 and the 53-week fiscal year ended February 28, 2015, respectively. 
Wholesale
Supervalu organizes and operates its Wholesale segment through two geographic regions: East and West. As of February 25, 2017, the Wholesale network spans 40 states and Supervalu serves as primary grocery supplier to approximately 1,902 stores of wholesale customers, in addition to Supervalu’s own Retail stores, as well as serving as secondary grocery supplier to approximately 244 wholesale customer stores. Supervalu’s wholesale customers include single and multiple grocery store operators, regional chains and the military, many of whom are long tenured Supervalu customers. The following charts depict the composition of Supervalu’s wholesale customer mix and tenure of Supervalu’s top 25 customers by net sales:

Supervalu has established a network of strategically located distribution centers utilizing a multi-tiered logistics system. The network includes facilities that carry slow turn or fast turn groceries, perishables, general merchandise and home, health and beauty care products. As of February 25, 2017, the network is comprised of 18 distribution facilities, ten of which supply Supervalu’s own Retail stores in addition to stores of wholesale customers, and one distribution center dedicated to supplying the Shop ’n Save banner in the St. Louis, Missouri area. In March 2017, Supervalu acquired an additional distribution center in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania that has approximately 732 thousand square footage that will eventually replace the Lancaster, Pennsylvania facility that is owned by New Albertson’s, Inc. (“NAI”) and operated by Supervalu. Wholesale distribution sales to Supervalu’s own Retail stores are eliminated within the Wholesale segment in Supervalu’s financial statements. Deliveries to retail stores are made from Supervalu’s distribution centers by Company-owned trucks, third-party independent trucking companies or customer-owned trucks.
Supervalu offers wholesale customers a wide variety of food and non-food products, including national and regional brands, and Supervalu’s own extensive lines of private label products. Supervalu also offers a broad array of professional services that provide wholesale customers with cost-effective and scalable solutions. These services include pass-through programs in which vendors provide services directly to our wholesale customers, as well as services and solutions developed and provided directly by Supervalu. Supervalu’s services include retail store support, advertising, couponing, e-Commerce, network and data hosting solutions, training and certifications classes, as well as administrative back-office solutions. The sales and operating results for these services are included within Wholesale.
As a logistics provider, efficiency is an important customer service measure. Supervalu optimizes its facilities to implement leading warehouse technology, ranging from radio-frequency devices guiding selectors to mechanized facilities with completely automated order selection for dry groceries that help Supervalu deliver aisle-ready pallets to wholesale customers. The Wholesale segment also focuses on improving its supply chain to achieve labor and cost efficiencies.
Retail
Supervalu conducts its Retail operations through a total of 217 stores, as of February 25, 2017, primarily organized under five retail grocery banners of Cub Foods, Shoppers Food & Pharmacy, Shop ’n Save in the St. Louis market, Farm Fresh, Shop ’n Save in the east coast market and Hornbacher’s, plus two Rainbow stores. Retail stores provide an extensive grocery offering and, depending on size, a variety of additional products, including general merchandise, home, health and beauty care, and pharmacy, Supervalu’s Retail stores offer, national and regional brands as well as Supervalu’s own private label products. A typical Retail store carries approximately 14,000 to 21,000 core SKUs, depending on the retail banner, and ranges in size from approximately 40,000 to 60,000 square feet, varying by banner.
Supervalu believes its Retail banners have strong local and regional brand recognition in the markets in which they operate. Supervalu’s Retail operations are supplied by one dedicated distribution center and nine distribution centers that are part of the Wholesale segment providing wholesale distribution to both Supervalu’s Retail stores and stores of wholesale customers. Refer to Item 2—Properties for additional information regarding Retail stores by banner and the markets in which they operate.
Sale of Save-A-Lot
On December 5, 2016, Supervalu completed the sale of Supervalu’s Save-A-Lot business to SAL Acquisition Corp (f/k/a Smith Acquisition Corp), an affiliate of Onex Partners Managers LP, for a purchase price of $1,365 in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments that were estimated at the time of the sale to reduce the purchase price by approximately $61. The sale of Save-A-Lot was completed pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 16, 2016 (“SAL 
4

Merger Agreement”), by and among SAL Acquisition Corp, SAL Merger Sub Corp (f/k/a Smith Merger Sub Corp), a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of the SAL Acquisition Corp, Supervalu and Moran Foods, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Supervalu prior to the sale. Concurrently with entering into the SAL Merger Agreement, Supervalu and Moran Foods also entered into a Separation Agreement (the “Separation Agreement”) pursuant to which, among other things, the assets and liabilities of the Save-A-Lot business were transferred to and assumed by Moran Foods, LLC prior to the completion of the sale. The assets, liabilities, operating results, and cash flows of Save-A-Lot have been presented separately as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented.
Corporate
In connection with the completion of Supervalu’s sale of Save-A-Lot on December 5, 2016, Supervalu and Moran Foods entered into a Services Agreement whereby Supervalu is providing certain technical, human resources, finance and other operational services to Save-A-Lot for a term of five years, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein. Moran Foods paid Supervalu $30 upon entry into the Services Agreement, which will be credited against fees due under the Services Agreement. The initial annual base charge under the Services Agreement is $30, subject to adjustments. Pursuant to this Services Agreement, Save-A-Lot may also request new services through the “change control” procedures described therein, and Supervalu may also agree to conduct non-recurring projects for Save-A-Lot pursuant to project orders.
Moran Foods may terminate the Services Agreement in the event of Supervalu’s material breach, if Supervalu breaches its non-compete obligations under the Merger Agreement, if Supervalu is acquired by a third party that engages in a Competing Business (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or in the event of Supervalu’s bankruptcy or insolvency, in each case, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Services Agreement. In addition, Moran Foods may terminate certain services or service categories if Supervalu commits a breach that is material to the service category or if Supervalu fails to meet certain minimum specified service levels, in each case, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Services Agreement. Supervalu may terminate the Services Agreement in the event of Moran Foods’ material breach, for Moran Foods’ failure to make timely payment, for certain legal or regulatory changes and in the event of Moran Foods’ bankruptcy or insolvency, in each case, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Services Agreement. The Services Agreement generally requires each party to indemnify the other party against third-party claims arising out of the performance of or the provision or receipt of services under the Services Agreement.
Supervalu provides back-office administrative support services under the transition services agreements (“TSA”) with NAI and Albertson’s LLC and is also providing services as needed to transition and wind down the TSA with NAI and Albertson’s LLC. Supervalu estimates that the complete transition and wind down of the TSA with NAI and Albertson’s LLC could take approximately two to three more years. In September 2016, NAI and Albertson’s LLC each notified Supervalu that it was again exercising its right to renew the term of their respective TSA for an additional year, which extended the expiration date of the NAI and Albertson’s LLC TSA to September 21, 2018, unless renewed again by notice given no later than September 21, 2017. The wind down of the TSA will result in the loss of significant revenue for Supervalu. 
In connection with Haggen’s bankruptcy process, Haggen has now closed or sold all 164 of its stores. The transition and wind down of the Haggen transition services agreement occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, with Supervalu now providing limited services in connection with the wind down of the Haggen estate.
Products
Supervalu offers a wide variety of nationally advertised brand name and private-label products, including grocery (both perishable and nonperishable), general merchandise, home, health and beauty care, and pharmacy, which are sold through Supervalu’s Wholesale segment to Wholesale customers and through Company-operated Retail stores to shoppers. Supervalu believes that it has adequate and alternative sources of supply for most of its purchased products.

Private-Label Products
Supervalu’s private-label products are produced to Supervalu’s specification by many suppliers and compete in most categories. Private-label products include: the premium brands Culinary Circle® and Stockman & Dakota®, which offer unique, premium quality products in highly competitive categories; Wild Harvest®, which is free from over 100 undesirable ingredients; core brands Essential Everyday®, EQUALINE®, and category-specific brands Arctic Shores Seafood Company®, Baby Basics®, Farm Stand®, Stone Ridge Creamery® and Super Chill®, which provide shoppers quality national brand equivalent products at a competitive price; and the value brand Shopper’s Value®, which offers budget conscious consumers a quality alternative to national brands at substantial savings.
Trademarks
Supervalu offers Wholesale customers the opportunity to franchise a concept or license a service mark. These programs help our Wholesale customers compete by providing, as part of the franchise or license program, a complete business concept, group advertising, private-label products and other benefits. Supervalu is the franchisor or licensor of certain banner store service marks such as CUB FOODS, FESTIVAL FOODS, SENTRY, COUNTY MARKET, SHOP ’N SAVE, NEWMARKET, FOODLAND, JUBILEE and SUPERVALU. In conjunction with its licensing and franchise arrangements, Supervalu maintains wholesale distribution agreements with its licensees and franchisees, primarily under the Cub Foods, Festival Foods, Sentry and Rainbow banners.
Supervalu files a substantial number of its trademarks/service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, including for many of its private-label product brands. U.S. trademark and service mark registrations are for a term of ten years, and renewable every ten years as long as the trademark is used in the regular course of trade. Supervalu considers certain of its trademarks and service marks to be of material importance to its Wholesale and Retail segments and actively defends and enforces such trademarks and service marks.
Working Capital
Normal operating fluctuations in working capital balances can result in changes to cash flow from operations presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows that are not necessarily indicative of long-term operating trends. Supervalu’s working capital needs are generally greater during the months leading up to high sales periods, such as the time period from prior to Thanksgiving through December. Supervalu typically finances these working capital needs with funds provided by operating activities and short-term borrowings. Inventories are managed primarily through demand forecasting and replenishing depleted inventories. There are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital.

Seasonality
Overall product sales are fairly balanced throughout the year, although demand for certain products of a seasonal nature may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons or other annual events. Our first quarter consists of 16 weeks, while all of our other quarters consist of 12 weeks, and all of our quarters typically include a major holiday.
Competition
Wholesale and Retail each operate in a highly competitive environment. 
Wholesale competes directly with a number of traditional and specialty grocery wholesalers and retailers that maintain or develop self-distribution systems. Supervalu believes it competes in this business on the basis of price, quality, assortment, schedule and reliability of deliveries and services, service fees and distribution facility locations.
Principal competition for Supervalu’s Retail segment comes from traditional grocery retailers, including regional and national chains and independent grocery store operators, and non-traditional retailers, such as supercenters, membership warehouse clubs, specialty supermarkets, hard discount stores, dollar stores, online retailers, convenience stores, drug stores and restaurants. Supervalu’s ability to differentiate itself from its competitors and create an attractive value proposition for its customers is dependent upon a combination of price, quality, customer service, convenience, e-commerce offerings, assortment, in-stock levels, brand perception, store location and conditions, in-store marketing and merchandising and promotional strategies. 
Supervalu believes that the success of its Wholesale and Retail segments is dependent upon the ability of its own stores, as well as the stores of wholesale customers it supplies, to compete successfully. Supervalu also competes to attract and maintain licensed and franchised operators to operate stores to which it provides wholesale distribution and services. This competition generally takes the form of alternative investment formats, such as a potential or existing licensee’s investment in fast food restaurants, dollar stores, specialty supermarkets, drug stores and other potential investments.
Recent and ongoing consolidation within the grocery industry has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, increased competition, including from some competitors that have greater financial, marketing and other resources than Supervalu.
Employees
As of February 25, 2017, Supervalu had approximately 29,000 employees. Approximately 16,000 employees are covered by 48 collective bargaining agreements. During fiscal 2017, twenty collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 9,200 employees were renegotiated. Also, three collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 140 employees have already expired without their terms being renegotiated. Negotiations are expected to continue with the bargaining units representing the employees subject to those expired agreements. During fiscal 2018, twenty-three collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 6,000 employees will expire. The majority of employees covered by these expiring collective bargaining agreements are located in Eastern markets. Supervalu is focused on ensuring competitive cost structures in each market in which it operates while meeting its employees’ needs for attractive wages and affordable healthcare and retirement benefits. Supervalu believes that it has generally good relations with its employees and with the labor unions that represent employees covered by collective bargaining agreements.
