 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
 Griffin Industrial Realty, Inc. (“Griffin”) is a real estate business principally engaged in developing, managing and leasing industrial/warehouse properties, and to a lesser extent, office/flex properties. Periodically, Griffin may sell certain portions of its undeveloped land that it has owned for an extended time period and the use of which is not consistent with Griffin’s core development and leasing strategy. Griffin seeks to add to its property portfolio through the acquisition and development of land or the purchase of buildings. Prior to May 13, 2015, Griffin was known as Griffin Land & Nurseries, Inc. On May 13, 2015, Griffin changed its name to better reflect its ongoing real estate business and focus on industrial/warehouse properties after the sale in fiscal 2014 of the landscape nursery business that Griffin had operated through its wholly owned subsidiary, Imperial Nurseries, Inc. (see Landscape Nursery Business on page 10).
 As of November 30, 2016, Griffin owned thirty‑three buildings comprising approximately 3,297,000 square feet that was 93% leased. Approximately 87% of Griffin’s currently owned square footage is industrial/warehouse space, with the balance principally being office/flex space. As of November 30, 2016, approximately 96% of Griffin’s industrial/warehouse space was leased and approximately 74% of Griffin’s office/flex space was leased. Subsequent to November 30, 2016, Griffin completed the signing of two leases for industrial/warehouse space aggregating approximately 104,000 square feet, resulting in Griffin’s total portfolio being approximately 96% leased, with industrial/warehouse space being approximately 99% leased. As stated in “Item 2. Properties” below, Griffin uses nonrecourse mortgages to finance some of its real estate development activities, and as of November 30, 2016, approximately $111.1 million was outstanding under such loans. In fiscal 2016, Griffin’s profit from leasing activities (which Griffin defines as rental revenue less operating expenses of rental properties) was approximately $18.2 million, while debt service on Griffin’s nonrecourse mortgages was approximately $7.3 million.
 Through fiscal 2009, all of Griffin’s buildings were located in the north submarket of Hartford, Connecticut. In fiscal 2010, Griffin started the expansion of its real estate holdings to areas outside of Hartford by purchasing an industrial building and undeveloped land in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania (see Lehigh Valley on page 7). Griffin expects to continue to seek to acquire and develop properties that are consistent with its core strategy of developing and leasing industrial properties. Griffin expects that most of such potential acquisitions of either undeveloped land or land and buildings will likely be located outside of the Hartford area.
 A national real estate services company reported that as of December 31, 2016, there was approximately 73.5 million square feet of industrial/warehouse space in the greater Hartford market and that the overall vacancy rate in the greater Hartford industrial market decreased from 12.3% at the end of 2014 to 9.2% at the end of 2016, with approximately 1.0 million square feet of net absorption in 2016. The greater Hartford industrial market had been stagnant in the years 2012 through 2014, but improved in 2015 and 2016. In the greater Hartford area, there are a number of fully or partially vacant industrial/warehouse buildings that are competitive with Griffin’s industrial/warehouse buildings. Griffin believes that it benefits from its reputation as a stable landlord with sufficient resources to meet its obligations and deliver space to tenants timely and in accordance with the terms of their lease agreements.
 A national real estate services company reported that as of December 31, 2016, there was approximately 74.2 million square feet of industrial/warehouse space in the Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania, and that the vacancy rate in that market was 5.2% at that date, with a net absorption of approximately 7.6 million square feet in 2016. The Lehigh Valley industrial market has experienced strong growth and leasing activity during the past two years with an increase of approximately 11.5 million square feet of industrial/warehouse space. 
 All of Griffin’s office/flex space is in the north submarket of Hartford. A national real estate services company reported that as of December 31, 2016, there was approximately 24.6 million square feet of office space in the greater Hartford market, including approximately 14.9 million square feet of suburban office space. They also reported that the overall vacancy rate has remained at approximately 16% over the past two years, with the vacancy rate in the north submarket being 21% during that period. As of November 30, 2016, square footage of office/flex buildings comprised approximately 13% of Griffin’s total square footage, and Griffin expects that its office/flex space will continue to

become a smaller percentage of its total space as Griffin expects to focus on the growth of its industrial/warehouse building portfolio either through acquisition of fully or partially leased buildings, development of buildings on land currently owned or to be acquired, or both.
 Additional capacity or an increase in vacancies in either the industrial or office markets could adversely affect Griffin’s operating results by potentially resulting in longer times to lease vacant space, eroding lease rates in Griffin’s properties or hindering renewals by existing tenants. There can be no assurances as to the directions of the Hartford and Lehigh Valley real estate markets in the near future.
 In fiscal 2016, Griffin completed and placed in service an approximately 252,000 square foot industrial building (“5210 Jaindl”) in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania, thus completing the development of an approximately 50 acre parcel of undeveloped land acquired in December 2013. As of November 30, 2016, Griffin had entered into two leases for 5210 Jaindl resulting in that building being fully leased. Both of those leases are expected to become effective in the first half of fiscal 2017. In addition to the two leases at 5210 Jaindl, Griffin entered into several other leases aggregating approximately 240,000 square feet in fiscal 2016, all but approximately 21,000 square feet of which was for industrial/warehouse space. Included in the fiscal 2016 leasing activity was a lease for approximately 101,000 square feet in 4270 Fritch Drive (“4270 Fritch”), an approximately 303,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in the Lehigh Valley built in fiscal 2014. As of November 30, 2016, Griffin’s five Lehigh Valley industrial/warehouse buildings aggregating approximately 1,183,000 square feet were fully leased. In addition to the Lehigh Valley leasing, Griffin completed several leases aggregating approximately 139,000 square feet for its Connecticut properties, including approximately 118,000 square feet of industrial/warehouse space, mostly in New England Tradeport (“NE Tradeport”), Griffin’s master‑planned industrial park near Bradley International Airport and Interstate 91, located in Windsor and East Granby, Connecticut. In fiscal 2016, Griffin also extended leases aggregating approximately 248,000 square feet, most of which was NE Tradeport industrial/warehouse space. Also in fiscal 2016, leases for approximately 132,000 square feet expired, which included a lease for an entire approximately 57,000 square foot NE Tradeport industrial/warehouse building that was subsequently re-leased during the year. The net effect of these transactions was an increase of approximately 410,000 square feet in industrial/warehouse space under lease as of November 30, 2016 as compared to November 30, 2015 and a decrease of approximately 51,000 square feet in office/flex space under lease as of November 30, 2016 as compared to November 30, 2015.
 In fiscal 2015, Griffin completed and placed in service an approximately 280,000 square foot industrial building (“5220 Jaindl”) in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania. The tenant that initially leased approximately 196,000 square feet in 5220 Jaindl when the building was placed in service subsequently exercised its option under the lease to lease the balance of the building. Rental revenue on the additional space commenced in fiscal 2016. In addition to fully leasing 5220 Jaindl in fiscal 2015, Griffin completed several other leases aggregating approximately 191,000 square feet, of which approximately 90% was for industrial/warehouse space and approximately 10% was for office/flex space. In fiscal 2015, several leases aggregating approximately 52,000 square feet of office/flex space expired and were not renewed and a lease of approximately 31,000 square feet of industrial/warehouse space was terminated early for which Griffin received a lease termination fee. The net effect of these transactions was an increase of approximately 421,000 square feet in industrial/warehouse space under lease as of November 30, 2015 as compared to November 30, 2014 and a decrease of approximately 33,000 square feet in office/flex space under lease as of November 30, 2015 as compared to November 30, 2014. In fiscal 2015, Griffin also renewed and extended several leases aggregating approximately 326,000 square feet of industrial/warehouse space and approximately 71,000 square feet of office/flex space.
 In fiscal 2014, Griffin entered into three new leases of industrial/warehouse space for an aggregate of approximately 371,000 square feet and three new leases of office/flex space for an aggregate of approximately 38,000 square feet. The leasing of industrial/warehouse space in fiscal 2014 included a five year lease for approximately 202,000 square feet at 4270 Fritch. In fiscal 2014, Griffin also entered into a ten year full building lease for approximately 138,000 square feet in one of its industrial buildings in NE Tradeport. In fiscal 2014, leases of industrial/warehouse space aggregating approximately 43,000 square feet expired and were not renewed, and a lease of industrial/warehouse space increased by approximately 47,000 square feet as the remaining vacant space in the building was added to the leased space in accordance with the lease terms. The net effect of these transactions was an increase of approximately 374,000 square feet in industrial/warehouse space under lease during fiscal 2014, while office/flex space under lease was essentially unchanged during fiscal 2014. Griffin also renewed and extended several leases aggregating approximately 27,000 square feet of office/flex space and approximately 11,000 square feet of industrial/warehouse space in fiscal 2014.

 Periodically, Griffin may sell certain portions of its undeveloped land that it has owned for an extended time period and the use of which does not fit into Griffin’s core strategy of developing and leasing industrial and commercial properties. Such sale transactions may take place either before or after obtaining development approvals and building basic infrastructure.
 In fiscal 2016, Griffin completed one land sale for approximately $3.8 million. In each of fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, Griffin completed one land sale for approximately $0.6 million. In fiscal 2013, Griffin completed a sale of approximately 90 acres of undeveloped land in Windsor, Connecticut (the “Windsor Land Sale”) for cash proceeds of approximately $9.0 million, before transaction expenses. The land sold under the Windsor Land Sale is part of an approximately 268 acre parcel of undeveloped land in Bloomfield and Windsor, Connecticut known as Phoenix Crossing that has been held by Griffin for an extended time period. Under the terms of the Windsor Land Sale, Griffin and the buyer were each required to construct roadways connecting the land parcel that was sold to existing town roads. The roads constructed by the buyer and the road being constructed by Griffin will become new town roads, thereby providing access to the remaining acreage in Griffin’s land parcel. As a result of Griffin’s continuing involvement with the land sold, the Windsor Land Sale is being accounted for under the percentage of completion method, under which the revenue and gain on sale are recognized as the costs related to the property sold are incurred. Griffin recognized revenue of approximately $0.6 million, approximately $2.5 million and approximately $3.1 million from the Windsor Land Sale in fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. As of November 30, 2016, approximately $0.1 million of revenue from the Windsor Land Sale remains to be recognized.
 The weakness in the residential real estate market has adversely affected Griffin’s residential real estate development activities. The continued weakness of the residential real estate market could result in lower selling prices for Griffin’s land intended for residential use or delay the sale of such land.
 Griffin’s development of its land is affected by regulatory and other constraints. Subdivision and other residential development may also be affected by the potential adoption of initiatives meant to limit or concentrate residential growth. Industrial/warehouse development activities on Griffin’s undeveloped land may also be affected by traffic considerations, potential environmental issues, community opposition and other restrictions to development imposed by governmental agencies.
 Griffin maintains a corporate website at www.griffinindustrial.com. Griffin’s Annual Report on Form 10‑K, quarterly reports on Form 10‑Q, current reports on Form 8‑K and the proxy statement for Griffin’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders can be accessed through Griffin’s website or through the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Griffin will provide electronic or paper copies of its foregoing filings free of charge upon request. Griffin was incorporated in 1970.
 Industrial/Warehouse Properties
 Connecticut
 A significant portion of Griffin’s industrial development in Connecticut has been focused on NE Tradeport, where Griffin has built and currently owns thirteen industrial/warehouse buildings aggregating approximately 1,466,000 square feet, of which approximately 92% was leased as of November 30, 2016. Subsequent to November 30, 2016, Griffin entered into two leases in NE Tradeport for industrial/warehouse space aggregating approximately 104,000 square feet, resulting in Griffin’s portfolio of industrial/warehouse space in Connecticut being approximately 99% leased.
 In NE Tradeport, Griffin holds the rights to 795,000 square feet available for development under the State Traffic Certificate (“STC”) which relates to four approved building sites on approximately 70 acres and an approved addition to one of Griffin’s existing buildings. Griffin owns an additional 95 acres of undeveloped land within NE Tradeport, 60 acres of which are located in Windsor and the abutting 35 acres of which are located in East Granby. There are no STC or other approvals currently in place (other than zoning in the case of Windsor) for the development of this remaining land for industrial use. Griffin believes that additional infrastructure improvements, which may be significant, may be required to obtain approvals to develop portions of this land, particularly the portions in East Granby. Griffin expects to continue to direct much of its real estate efforts in Connecticut on the construction and leasing of its industrial/warehouse facilities at NE Tradeport.

 In fiscal 2016, Griffin leased approximately 87,000 square feet in NE Tradeport, including a new full building lease of approximately 57,000 square feet that replaced an existing full building lease that expired and was not renewed during fiscal 2016. Also in fiscal 2016, Griffin renewed several leases aggregating approximately 222,000 square feet. The rental rates for leases in NE Tradeport that were renewed in fiscal 2016 were, on average, essentially unchanged from the rental rates of the expiring leases. Management believes that the rental rates on the two NE Tradeport leases aggregating approximately 33,000 square feet that are scheduled to expire in fiscal 2017 are slightly above the market rates for similar space.
 In addition to its industrial/warehouse buildings in NE Tradeport, Griffin owns a 165,000 square foot industrial building (“1985 Blue Hills”) in Griffin Center, Griffin’s office park in Windsor and Bloomfield, Connecticut, that is being used principally as a data center and call center, an approximately 31,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building (“131 Phoenix”) in Bloomfield, Connecticut that is being used principally as a research and development facility and an approximately 18,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building (“210 West Newberry”) in Griffin Center South, Griffin’s office/flex park in Bloomfield, Connecticut. 131 Phoenix is on an approximately 5 acre site that is part of Phoenix Crossing. In fiscal 2013, Griffin sold approximately 90 acres of undeveloped Phoenix Crossing land in the Windsor Land Sale. As of November 30, 2016, Griffin owns approximately 159 acres of undeveloped land in Phoenix Crossing that is zoned for industrial and commercial development. On December 23, 2016, Griffin entered into an agreement to sell approximately 67 acres of its undeveloped land in Phoenix Crossing for approximately $10.25 million. Completion of this transaction is subject to a number of factors, including the buyer obtaining all necessary final permits from governmental authorities for development plans of the site and the buyer receiving municipal and state economic development incentives it deems adequate. There is no guarantee that this transaction will be completed under its current terms, or at all.
 As of November 30, 2016, approximately $66.2 million was invested (net book value) by Griffin in its Connecticut industrial/warehouse buildings, approximately $4.4 million was invested (net book value) by Griffin in the undeveloped NE Tradeport land and approximately $4.2 million was invested in the undeveloped Phoenix Crossing land, including the acreage under contract to be sold (see above). As of November 30, 2016, twelve of Griffin’s Connecticut industrial/warehouse buildings were mortgaged for an aggregate of approximately $54.0 million and 210 West Newberry was included in the collateral for Griffin’s $15.0 million revolving line of credit (see below). Subsequent to November 30, 2016, Griffin agreed to terms on a nonrecourse mortgage loan on two NE Tradeport industrial/warehouse buildings aggregating approximately 275,000 square feet that were not mortgaged as of November 30, 2016. Completion of this proposed new mortgage loan is subject to a number of contingencies, including the entry into a definitive loan agreement. There is no guarantee that this transaction will be completed under its current terms, or at all.
 A summary of Griffin’s Connecticut industrial/warehouse square footage owned and leased at the end of each of the past three fiscal years and leases in Griffin’s Connecticut industrial/warehouse buildings scheduled to expire during each of the next three fiscal years are as follows:

     Lehigh Valley
 In fiscal 2010, Griffin completed its first acquisition of property outside of the Hartford, Connecticut area, when it acquired a fully leased approximately 120,000 square foot industrial building at 871 Nestle Way (“871 Nestle”) in Breinigsville, Pennsylvania, which is located in the Lehigh Valley. Also in fiscal 2010, Griffin acquired approximately 51 acres of undeveloped land in Lower Nazareth, Pennsylvania, a major industrial area of the Lehigh Valley, which Griffin named Lehigh Valley Tradeport I. In fiscal 2012, Griffin completed construction, on speculation, of 4275 Fritch Drive (“4275 Fritch”), an approximately 228,000 square foot industrial building, the first of the two buildings built in Lehigh Valley Tradeport I. In fiscal 2013, Griffin entered into a five‑year full building lease of this building. In fiscal 2014, Griffin completed construction, also on speculation, of 4270 Fritch, an approximately 303,000 square foot industrial building, that was the second of two buildings built in Lehigh Valley Tradeport I. In fiscal 2014, Griffin entered into a five year lease of approximately 201,000 square feet of 4270 Fritch and the lease became effective in the fiscal 2015 second quarter upon completion of tenant improvements. In fiscal 2016, Griffin leased the remaining approximately 102,000 square feet of 4270 Fritch. In fiscal 2015, Griffin completed construction of 5220 Jaindl, the first of the two industrial/warehouse buildings built on the undeveloped land in Hanover Township of the Lehigh Valley acquired in December 2013, known as Lehigh Valley Tradeport II. In fiscal 2015, Griffin leased approximately 196,000 square feet of 5220 Jaindl. The lease commenced at the beginning of the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter, and in November 2015, the tenant exercised its option to lease the balance of the building. Rental revenue for the remaining space in 5220 Jaindl commenced in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2016, Griffin completed construction of 5210 Jaindl, an approximately 252,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building that was the second building built in Lehigh Valley Tradeport II. Griffin leased 5210 Jaindl in fiscal 2016, with rental revenue on the leases for 5210 Jaindl expected to begin in the first half of fiscal 2017.
 As of November 30, 2016, Griffin owned five fully leased industrial/warehouse buildings in the Lehigh Valley aggregating approximately 1,183,000 square feet. Approximately $65.5 million was invested (net book value) in these buildings as of November 30, 2016. All five Lehigh Valley industrial/warehouse buildings are mortgaged under three separate nonrecourse mortgage loans for a total of approximately $51.1 million as of November 30, 2016.
 A summary of Griffin’s Lehigh Valley industrial/warehouse square footage owned and leased at the end of each of the past three fiscal years and leases in Griffin’s Lehigh Valley industrial/warehouse buildings scheduled to expire during each of the next three fiscal years are as follows:

 | Square | Square | |

      On March 23, 2016, Griffin entered into an Agreement of Sale and Purchase (the “East Allen Purchase Agreement”) to acquire an approximately 31 acre site in East Allen Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania for development of an industrial/warehouse building. Subsequently, Griffin exercised its right to terminate the East Allen Purchase Agreement based on its due diligence findings. After the East Allen Purchase Agreement was terminated, Griffin has continued negotiations with the seller to reach a new agreement. Completion of a new purchase agreement is uncertain at this time.

 On May 4, 2016, Griffin entered into an Agreement of Sale and Purchase, as amended (the “Macungie Purchase Agreement”), to acquire, for a purchase price of $1.8 million, an approximately 14 acre site in Upper Macungie Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania for development of an approximately 134,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building. A closing on the land acquisition contemplated by the Macungie Purchase Agreement is subject to significant contingencies, including Griffin obtaining all governmental approvals for its planned development of the land that would be acquired. There is no guarantee that the land acquisition as contemplated under the Macungie Purchase Agreement will be completed under its current terms, or at all.
 Griffin may seek to acquire additional properties and/or undeveloped land parcels to expand the industrial/warehouse portion of its real estate business. Griffin continues to examine potential properties for acquisition in New England, the Mid‑Atlantic states and other areas.
 Office/Flex Properties
 Griffin’s office/flex properties are located in Griffin Center in Windsor and Bloomfield, Connecticut and Griffin Center South in Bloomfield. In Griffin Center, Griffin currently owns two multi‑story office buildings that have an aggregate of approximately 161,000 square feet, a single story office building of approximately 48,000 square feet and a small restaurant building of approximately 7,000 square feet. In Griffin Center South, Griffin currently owns eight office/flex buildings with an aggregate of approximately 217,000 square feet of single story office/flex space. As of November 30, 2016, approximately 319,000 square feet of Griffin’s office/flex square footage was leased, comprising approximately 74% of Griffin’s total office/flex space.
 In fiscal 2016, Griffin entered into two new leases for office/flex space aggregating approximately 21,000 square feet, including a lease for approximately 16,000 square feet in the single story Griffin Center office building that resulted in that building becoming fully leased. Also in fiscal 2016, two leases of office/flex space aggregating approximately 26,000 square feet were renewed, while leases aggregating approximately 72,000 square feet of office/flex space expired. The tenant of one of the expired office/flex leases (approximately 21,000 square feet) did not renew because they entered into a full building lease for 131 Phoenix, Griffin’s approximately 31,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in Phoenix Crossing. The rental rates for office/flex leases that were renewed in fiscal 2016 were, on average, approximately 5% lower than the rental rates of the expiring leases. Management believes that the rental rates on the three leases of office/flex space aggregating approximately 49,000 square feet that are scheduled to expire in fiscal 2017 are slightly above the market rates for similar space. Subsequent to November 30, 2016, Griffin entered into a ten year full building lease for the approximately 23,000 square feet at 206 West Newberry Road. The full building tenant there had previously informed Griffin that it would not be renewing its lease when it expires in fiscal 2017. The rental rate of the new lease is equivalent to the rate on the expiring lease; however, Griffin expects to incur higher operating expenses in servicing the new tenant than have been incurred in servicing the existing tenant.
 In the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter, Griffin closed on the sale of approximately 29 acres of an approximately 45 acre parcel of the undeveloped land in Griffin Center for approximately $3.8 million. An additional approximately 15 acres of that land parcel, much of which is wetlands with very limited development potential, was donated to an affiliate of the purchaser at the time of the closing.
 Currently there are approximately 162 acres of undeveloped land in Griffin Center and approximately 68 acres of undeveloped land in Griffin Center South that are owned by Griffin. As of November 30, 2016, approximately $18.4 million was invested (net book value) in Griffin’s office/flex buildings and approximately $1.6 million was invested by Griffin in the undeveloped land in Griffin Center and Griffin Center South. Griffin’s two multi‑story office buildings in Griffin Center are mortgaged for approximately $6.0 million as of November 30, 2016, and Griffin’s single story office building in Griffin Center and the eight single-story office/flex buildings and industrial/warehouse building in Griffin Center South are the collateral for Griffin’s $15.0 million revolving line of credit. There were no borrowings under the revolving line of credit as of November 30, 2016.

      Residential Developments
 Simsbury, Connecticut
 Several years ago, Griffin filed plans for the creation of a residential community, called Meadowood, on a 363 acre site in the Town of Simsbury, Connecticut (“Simsbury”). After several years of litigation with the town regarding this proposed residential development, a settlement was reached. The settlement terms included, among other things, approval for up to 296 homes, certain remediation measures and offsite road improvements to be performed by Griffin and the purchase by Simsbury of a portion of the Meadowood land for open space. The sale of land to Simsbury closed in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2012, Griffin performed a portion of the required remediation work on the site and completed the required offsite road improvements. In fiscal 2014, Griffin completed the required remediation work. As of November 30, 2016, the book value of the land for this development, including design, development and legal costs, was approximately $8.5 million. Griffin is continuing to evaluate its plans for Meadowood.
 Griffin owns another approximate 432 acres of undeveloped land in Simsbury, portions of which are zoned for residential use and other portions of which are zoned for industrial use. Not all of this land is developable. The land currently zoned for industrial use is probably more suited to commercial or mixed‑use development. Griffin may seek to develop or sell such land.
 Suffield, Connecticut
 In fiscal 2006, Griffin completed the infrastructure for a fifty lot residential subdivision in Suffield, Connecticut called Stratton Farms. Griffin sold twenty‑five residential lots in Stratton Farms to a local homebuilder in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2010, Griffin entered into an agreement with a privately owned regional homebuilder under which in exchange for a payment of $100,000, the homebuilder obtained an option to purchase the remaining twenty‑five residential lots of Stratton Farms. The option agreement terminated after four lots were sold. Subsequently, Griffin sold one Stratton Farms residential lot in fiscal 2013. As of November 30, 2016, Griffin held twenty Stratton Farms residential lots. The book value for Griffin’s Stratton Farms holdings was approximately $1.1 million at November 30, 2016. Other
 Concurrently with the sale of the landscape nursery business effective January 8, 2014, Imperial Nurseries, Inc. (“Imperial”), Griffin and Monrovia Connecticut LLC (“Monrovia”) entered into a Lease and Option Agreement, which was amended in fiscal 2016 (as amended, the “Imperial Lease”) pursuant to which Monrovia leased Imperial’s production nursery located in Granby and East Granby, Connecticut (the “Connecticut Farm”) for a ten year period, with

options to extend for up to an additional fifteen years exercisable by Monrovia. The Imperial Lease also grants Monrovia an option to purchase the land, land improvements and other operating assets that were used by Imperial on the Connecticut Farm during the first thirteen years of the lease period for $9.5 million, or $7.0 million if only a certain portion of the Connecticut Farm is purchased, subject in each case to certain adjustments as provided for in the Imperial Lease. 
 Prior to the fiscal 2009 third quarter, Imperial operated a production nursery in Quincy, Florida (the “Florida Farm”). In fiscal 2009, Imperial shut down its growing operations on the Florida Farm and leased that facility to a grower of landscape nursery plants. In fiscal 2015, the tenant exercised its option to acquire the Florida Farm, but subsequently informed Imperial that it would not close the acquisition. As a result, Griffin retained the tenant’s deposit of $400,000 and the Florida Farm lease was extended through April 30, 2016. After the expiration of that lease, Griffin then entered into a new lease of the Florida Farm with another grower of landscape nursery plants that started July 1, 2016. The new lease of the Florida Farm has a three year term and contains an option for the tenant to purchase the Florida Farm at any time during the lease period for a purchase price between $3.4 million and $3.9 million depending upon the date of sale.
 In fiscal 2016, Griffin leased approximately 650 acres of undeveloped land in Connecticut and Massachusetts to local farmers. Approximately 550 acres and 485 acres were leased to local farmers in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. The revenue generated from the leasing of farmland is not material to Griffin’s total revenue.
 On January 25, 2016, Griffin entered into an Option Purchase Agreement (the “Option Agreement”) whereby Griffin granted the buyer an exclusive option, in exchange for a nominal fee, to purchase approximately 280 acres of undeveloped land in Simsbury for approximately $7.7 million. The buyer may extend the option period up to three years upon payment of additional option fees. Subsequent to November 30, 2016, the buyer paid Griffin to extend the option period. The land subject to the Option Agreement does not have any of the approvals that would be required for the buyer’s planned use of the land. A closing on the land sale contemplated by the Option Agreement is subject to several significant contingencies, including the buyer securing contracts under a competitive bidding process that would require changes in the use of the land and obtaining local and state approvals for that planned use. There is no guarantee that the sale of undeveloped land as contemplated under the Option Agreement will be completed under its current terms, or at all.
 Griffin is evaluating its other properties for development or sale in the future. Griffin anticipates that obtaining subdivision approvals for residential development in many of the towns where it owns residentially‑zoned land will be an extended process.
 Landscape Nursery Business
 Through January 7, 2014, Imperial operated a landscape nursery business that grew containerized plants on the Connecticut Farm for sale to independent retail garden centers and rewholesalers, whose main customers are landscape contractors. Imperial discontinued its nursery operations on January 8, 2014, when Griffin, Imperial and Monrovia entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement whereby Imperial’s inventory and certain of its assets were sold to Monrovia for approximately $0.7 million in cash, before transaction and severance costs, and a non‑interest bearing note receivable (which Griffin subsequently collected) of $4.25 million (the “Imperial Sale”). Pursuant to the terms of the Imperial Sale, Griffin and Imperial agreed to indemnify Monrovia for any potential environmental liabilities on the Connecticut Farm relating to periods prior to the effective date of the Imperial Sale.

stock in Centaur Media in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016. Griffin expects that it will sell its Centaur Media common stock when it believes sales terms are favorable.
 Employees
 As of November 30, 2016, Griffin employed 33 people on a full‑time basis. Presently, none of Griffin’s employees are represented by a union. Griffin believes that its relations with its employees are satisfactory. Competition
 The market for leasing industrial/warehouse space and office/flex space is highly competitive. Griffin competes for tenants with owners of numerous properties located in the portions of Connecticut, Massachusetts and the Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania in which Griffin’s real estate holdings are concentrated. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than Griffin. Griffin’s real estate business competes on the bases of location, price, availability of space, convenience and amenities.
 There is a great amount of competition for the acquisition of industrial/warehouse buildings and for the acquisition of undeveloped land for construction of such buildings. Griffin competes for the acquisition of industrial/warehouse properties with real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and institutional investors, such as pension funds, private real estate investment funds, insurance company investment accounts, public and private investment companies, individuals and other entities engaged in real estate investment activities. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than Griffin, and may be able to accept more risk, including risk related to the creditworthiness of tenants or the degree of leverage they may be willing to take on. Competitors for acquisitions may also have advantages from a lower cost of capital or greater operating efficiencies associated with being a larger entity. 
 Regulation: Environmental Matters
 Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with contamination. The cost of investigation, remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to remediate properly such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral. In connection with the ownership (direct or indirect), operation, management and development of real estate properties, Griffin may be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and, therefore, potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other related costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property. The value of Griffin’s land may be affected by the presence of residual chemicals from the prior use of the land for farming, principally on a portion of the land that is intended for residential use. In the event that Griffin is unable to remediate adequately any of its land intended for residential use, Griffin’s ability to develop such property for its intended purposes would be materially affected.
 Griffin periodically reviews its properties for the purpose of evaluating such properties’ compliance with applicable state and federal environmental laws. In connection with the Imperial Sale, Griffin has incurred a small amount of costs to remediate a small area of the Connecticut Farm that is leased to Monrovia under the Imperial Lease. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K, Griffin is in discussions with the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (“DEEP”) regarding the recent findings of exceedances of certain residual pesticides on a limited portion of the Connecticut Farm being leased to Monrovia. At this time, Griffin does not anticipate experiencing, in the next twelve months, any material expense in complying with such laws. Griffin may incur remediation costs in the future in connection with its development operations. Such costs are not expected to be significant as compared to expected proceeds from development projects or property sales.
