 Company Background
  
  We are a Delaware corporation, originally incorporated in 1988 under the name Terrapin Diagnostics, Inc. in the state of Delaware, and subsequently renamed “Telik, Inc.” in 1998, and thereafter renamed MabVax Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. in September 2014. Our principal corporate office is located at 11535 Sorrento Valley Road, Suite 400, San Diego, CA 92121 and our telephone number is (858) 259-9405. On July 8, 2014, we consummated a merger with MabVax Therapeutics, pursuant to which our subsidiary Tacoma Acquisition Corp. merged with and into MabVax Therapeutics, with MabVax Therapeutics surviving as our wholly owned subsidiary. This transaction is referred to as the “Merger.” Our internet address is www.mabvax.com. Information on our website is not incorporated into this report.
Listing Reverse Split
  On June 29, 2016, our stockholders approved a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a range of between 1-for-2 and 1-for-15, with the specific ratio and effective time of the reverse stock split to be determined by our Board of Directors, or our Board. On August 2, 2016, the Board approved a 1-for-7.4 reverse stock split, or the Listing Reverse Split. The Listing Reverse Split was intended to allow us to meet the minimum share price requirement of The NASDAQ Capital Market, or NASDAQ. On August 11, 2016, we received approval from The NASDAQ Capital Market for the listing of our common stock under the symbol “MBVX”, subject to implementation of the Listing Reverse Split and closing of our August 2016 public offering (the “August 2016 Public Offering”). On August 16, 2016, we implemented the Listing Reverse Split, closed on the August 2016 Public Offering and began trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market at the open of business on August 17, 2016.
 Overview
  
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of antibody-based products to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of cancer.  MabVax has discovered a pipeline of human monoclonal antibody products based on the protective immune responses generated by patients who have been vaccinated against targeted cancers with our proprietary vaccines.  MabVax's lead development program is centered around our HuMab-5B1 antibody, which is fully human and discovered from the immune response of cancer patients vaccinated with an antigen-specific vaccine during a Phase I trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, or MSK.   The antigen the antibody targets is expressed on more than 90% of pancreatic cancers, and also expressed in significant percentages on small cell lung cancer, stomach, colon and other cancers, making the antibody potentially broadly applicable to many types of cancers.  We have other antibody candidates that are also in preclinical development.
  Monoclonal antibodies are produced from a single DNA sequence encoded into multiple cells that all produce the same single antibody. We generate our pipeline of antibody-based product candidates from patients who have been vaccinated with propriety vaccines licensed from MSK. Our approach involves surveying the protective immune response from many patients to identify a monoclonal antibody candidate against a specific target on the surface of a cancer cell. We believe this approach provides us with a novel next-generation human antibody technology platform. We believe our approach to antibody discovery allows us to identify antibody candidates with superior performance characteristics while minimizing many of the toxicity and off target binding drawbacks (phenomenon occurring when antibodies bind to non-cancer cells) of other discovery technologies.
Our Growth and Core Business Strategy
  Our primary business strategy is to develop our early antibody product candidates through proof of concept clinical trials, which may represent either phase I or phase II clinical trials depending on the program and extent of progress. We intend to then partner those product candidates having the highest clinical and commercial potential from our discovery library of antibody candidates.
 Recent Developments
  
 In November 2016 we reported on interim results of our two HuMab-5B1 antibody phase I clinical development programs evaluating the use of our therapeutic antibody we designate as MVT-5873, and our immuno-PET imaging agent we designate as MVT-2163, comprised of MVT-5873 conjugated to a radio label. In December 2016 we submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for our radioimmunotherapy product candidate we designate as MVT-1075, comprised of MVT-5873 conjugated to a low-energy radiation emitter. These three product candidates are intended for use in patients with locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer or other malignancies expressing the same cancer antigen known as CA19.9.

  MVT-5873 Clinical Development Program Progress in Treating Pancreatic Cancer, and Near-term Plan
  In our progress report released in November 2016, we stated that the safety of MVT-5873 had been established at three incremental dose levels by treating 16 patients at three clinical sites. The purpose of this phase I clinical trial, initiated in February 2016, is to establish safety and tolerability, and to determine the recommended phase II dose. Patients entering this part of the trial have progressive locally advanced or metastatic disease and have failed all previous treatments.
  As of mid-November 2016, we reported that 28 subjects had consented to treatment, of which 16 subjects had been treated. Of the remaining subjects, nine had failed the screening tests, and three were still in the screening process. Of the 16 patients that had been treated as of that date, six were continuing to receive treatment beyond the study design of a 28-day treatment cycle. Patients are able to remain on therapy beyond the initial 28-day treatment and safety assessment cycle based on acceptable dose tolerability and investigator assessment of continued benefit from the treatment. Every second treatment cycle the investigator assesses disease status using RECIST 1.1 measurement criteria to evaluate tumor response rate and duration of response. Investigators report that seven of the 16 patient patients converted from progressive disease to stable disease lasting from three months to eight months. We plan to continue to recruit patients in Part 1 of the study of MVT-5873, which is intended to establish the recommended phase II dose as a monotherapy.
  In early February 2017, we reported that out of the total of 22 patients treated to date, eight had stable disease after at least two treatment cycles, or two months, seven continued to have stable disease after at least four treatment cycles, or four months; and three continued to have stable disease after at least six treatment cycles, or six months.
  
 As a consequence of establishing the current dosage safety level for MVT-5873 in Part 1 of the trial, we have established a sufficient dosage safety margin to initiate part 2 of our phase I study. Part 2 combines our MVT-5873 with a standard of care chemotherapy regimen in new diagnosed treatment naïve patients. The dosage levels established in our MVT-5873 monotherapy trial have cleared all subsequent dose levels utilized in our Phase I clinical study of MVT-2163 as an immuno-PET imaging agent as well as the dose levels planned for our clinical study of MVT-1075 that combines the antibody with a radioactive metal as a radioimmunotherapy product. We filed an IND with the FDA in late December 2016 and received an authorization from the FDA on January 27, 2017 to proceed with our phase I clinical trial in the first half of 2017.
   MVT-2163 Clinical Development Program Progress in Imaging Pancreatic Cancer, and Near-term Plan
  In our progress report released in November 2016, we stated that we had established interim safety, and acceptable pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of MVT-2163 in our phase I clinical trial. We have completed the initial two cohorts of patients as specified in our protocol. In the first cohort we administered MVT-2163 alone and in the second cohort we administered MVT-2163 following a blocking dose of MVT-5873. We reported that the initial PET images demonstrated target specificity by correlation with lesions identified by conventional computerized tomography (CT) scans. The biodistribution data obtained in the first two cohorts demonstrated improvement in PET images by pre-administration of MVT-5873, as has been observed with other antibody based PET agents. We initiated the MVT-2163 phase I trial in June 2016 to evaluate a next generation diagnostic PET imaging agent in patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (PDAC) or other CA19-9 positive malignancies. MVT-2163 (89Zr-HuMab-5B1) combines the well-established PET imaging radiolabel Zirconium [89Zr] with the targeting specificity of MVT-5873. We designed the trial to establish safety, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, optimal time to obtain the PET image, and the amount of MVT-5873 to be used in co-administration to obtain optimized PET scan images. We continue to actively recruit patients and expect to establish the optimal co-administration dose of MVT-5873 early in 2017.
 MVT-1075 Clinical Development Plan
  We are developing HuMab-5B1 into a third potential product for use as a radioimmunotherapy that we have designated as MVT-1075. MVT-1075 represents a unique product opportunity for MabVax by conjugating MVT-5873 with a low-energy radiation emitter, 177Lu, which has a relatively short tissue penetration range to minimize potential side effects of the radiation. MVT-5873 provides the opportunity for tumor-specific targeting of a more potent analog of MVT-5873. We submitted our IND in late December 2016, and the IND was authorized to proceed on January 27, 2017. We plan to initiate the phase I trial of MVT-1075 in the first half of 2017.

  Antibody Market Opportunity
  
 The global monoclonal antibodies market was valued at $85 billion in 2015 and is expected to reach a value of $138 billion by 2024 (The Pharma Letter, February 11, 2016). Over the past couple of decades, the US FDA has approved more than a dozen monoclonal antibodies to treat certain cancers (cancer.org). Focused development of new monoclonal antibody based drugs is expected to continue for multiple reasons.  Over the last few years much has been learned about using the human immune system to treat cancer.  Several recently approved antibody therapies have demonstrated efficacy in stimulating the human immune system to attack certain cancers. Targeted therapies can attack cancer cells while minimizing damage to normal cells in the patient. Antibodies are complex molecules and are difficult and expensive to duplicate with biosimilars and therefore have a potentially longer commercial life. Currently approved monoclonal antibodies are reimbursed at favorable levels from federal, state, and private insurance providers.
  Our lead antibody candidate targets an antigen that is over expressed on many metastatic pancreatic, colon, breast, and small cell lung cancers. The term "over expressed" refers to the antigen being present on the surface of the cancer cell in very large numbers. The amount of antigen present in blood samples is used to monitor patients as elevated levels occur in the blood due to shedding into the blood from these cancer cells. Patients who develop metastatic disease have a significantly poorer prognosis for survival.
   We believe there is a critical unmet medical need for new and better treatment for metastatic pancreatic and colon cancer. According to NCI’s SEER database (seer.cancer.gov), the five-year survival rate for patients with pancreatic cancer is just 7.7%. There are 53,000 new patients with pancreatic cancer diagnosed per year and more than half of these patients present at initial diagnosis with metastatic disease (Pancreatic Cancer Network’s Pancreatic Facts 2016). In 2016 pancreatic cancer moved from the fourth leading cause of cancer related death in the U.S. to third, surpassing breast cancer (American Cancer Society Cancer statistics 2016 report,). According to the SEER database, there are about 134,000 patients diagnosed with cancer of the colon and rectum per year in the US. The five-year survival rate for the 35% of patients with metastatic colon cancer that is locally spread is 71% and the five-year survival of the 35% of patients that have regional spread is only 13.5%.
  
  Pancreatic Cancer Imaging and Diagnosis
  
  We believe that our radiolabeled HuMab-5B1 PET imaging antibody represents the only human derived agent in development specifically aimed at improving imaging in pancreatic cancer diagnosis over the standard of care (FDG-PET). Since the antigen targeted by the HuMab-5B1 antibody is over expressed on metastatic pancreatic cancer cells, this development effort represents a potentially important step forward in the diagnosis, staging, and assessment of the majority of patients newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancers. We believe that the market opportunity for a HuMab-5B1antibody-based radiopharmaceutical is significant in multiple ways. The ability of physicians to accurately diagnose, stage, and assess treatment outcomes in pancreatic cancer would be very important. Accurate determinations on the extent of disease and resectability are essential to improve outcomes in this cancer. We believe that limitations in FDG-PET imaging offers significant room for improvement in diagnostic technique and that accurate determinations on extent of disease and resectability are essential to improving outcomes in this cancer. Improvements in the sensitivity and specificity over FDG-PET could have a significant impact on improving diagnosis and clinical outcome.
 Radioimmunotherapy: Therapeutic Treatment Product
   In addition to developing our HuMab-5B1 as a stand-alone therapeutic agent as well as a PET imaging agent, we are developing a HuMab-5B1 based radioimmunotherapy, or RIT, product candidate as a potential treatment for pancreatic cancer and other CA19-9 positive tumors. Our preclinical animal studies have demonstrated the potential feasibility and experimental proof of concept for this new product candidate. We have learned from our 89Zr-HuMab-5B1 PET imaging clinical development program that we have sufficient safety and specificity of the product to proceed with clinical development of our RIT program. We submitted an IND to FDA for this product in December of 2016 and received FDA authorization in January 2017 to proceed with our proposed clinical trial. We anticipate initiating our clinical trial in the first half of 2017.

  License and Development Agreements
   Memorial Sloan Kettering
  We have licensed from MSK the exclusive world-wide developmental and commercial rights to receive biological materials from vaccinated clinical trial participants enrolled in any of the clinical trials involving the vaccines licensed to us, allowing us to discover human monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics. MSK has issued patents or has pending patent applications on the vaccine antigen conjugates, mixtures of vaccine antigen conjugates and methods of use. This patent portfolio includes 20 issued patents in the US and the rest of world.  We own all monoclonal antibodies produced by the antibody discovery program and we generally file patent applications directed to these antibodies once their potential therapeutic utility has been sufficiently demonstrated in animal models. A United States and an international patent application for each of the anti-sLea antibodies and the anti GD2 antibodies described in this document has been filed.
  We have licensed exclusive rights from MSK to exploit key aspects of the work of Dr. Livingston (who is also a member of our board of directors) and colleagues, who over the last 30 years have developed a series of monovalent (targeting a single tumor cell surface antigen) cancer vaccines against cancers of neuroectodermal and epithelial (breast, ovarian colon, pancreatic) origin as well as small cell lung cancer, or SCLC. These target molecules on malignant cells, known as carbohydrate antigens, are the most extensively expressed antigenic targets on the cell surface of these types of cancers and play a key role in tissue invasion and metastasis. We expect to benefit from the years of work and significant expense already invested in the development and testing of the vaccines incorporating these antigens. Researchers at MSK have progressively developed highly immunogenic monovalent vaccines to each of the 11 validated target antigens that comprise the licensed vaccines. These monovalent vaccines or the combination of the monovalent forms into polyvalent vaccines (targeting multiple antigens) have been tested and refined not only in animal models but also in multiple clinical trials establishing immunogenicity, tolerability, and therapeutic utility. Our license agreement with MSK calls for MSK to complete all preclinical and Phase I clinical trial work at MSK’s expense at which point the IND would be transferred to us for continued development.
  Our lead cancer vaccines targeting recurrent sarcoma and ovarian cancer are currently in proof of concept Phase II multi-center clinical trials. Both trials are fully enrolled, and have received substantial federal grant monies to support their development.
   Life Technologies Licensing Agreement
  On September 24, 2015, we entered into a licensing agreement with Life Technologies Corporation, a subsidiary of ThermoFisher Scientific (“Life Technologies”).  Under the agreement we agreed to license certain cell lines from Life Technologies to be used in the production of recombinant proteins for our clinical trials.  The amount of the contract is for $450,000 and was fully expensed during 2015.  We paid $225,000 during 2015 related to this contract with the remaining amount paid in 2016.
 Rockefeller University Collaboration
  In July 2015, we entered into a research collaboration agreement with Rockefeller University's Laboratory of Molecular Genetics and Immunology (“Rockefeller”). We provided antibody material to Rockefeller, which is exploring the mechanism of action of constant region (Fc) variants of the HuMab 5B1 in the role of tumor clearance. We will supply additional research materials as requested by the university, which is evaluating ways to optimize the function. Rockefeller is using that material to explore the mechanism of action of constant region (Fc) variants of the HuMab-5B1 in the role of tumor clearance and to seek to optimize the therapeutic effect.   The current agreement allows researchers at Rockefeller to conduct research on antibodies discovered by us with the objective of improving their ability to kill cancer cells.  If a viable drug candidate emerges from this collaboration, we have the right to enter into negotiations with Rockefeller for the right to exclusively license the technology used to improve our antibody for clinical and commercial development.  If we and Rockefeller fail to reach agreement on terms for a license to the drug candidate that contains the combined technologies, Rockefeller does not have the right to license the drug candidate to a third party without our consent because the drug candidate contains our intellectual property embodied in the antibody.
 Juno Option Agreement
  On August 29, 2014, we entered into an Option Agreement with Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (“Juno”) in exchange for a one-time up-front option fee in the low five figures. Pursuant to the option agreement, we granted Juno the option to obtain an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license authorizing Juno to develop, make, have made, use, import, have imported, sell, have sold, offer for sale and otherwise exploit certain patents we developed with respect to fully human antibodies with binding specificity against human GD2 or sialyl-Lewis A antigens and certain of our controlled biologic materials. As of June 30, 2016, the option agreement expired and Juno no longer has a contractual right for use of our binding domains for use in the construction of CAR T-cells.

  Patents
  
  We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our vaccines and monoclonal antibody-based candidates, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
  
  We are the exclusive licensee, sole assignee or co-assignee of 14 granted United States patents, 2 pending United States patent applications, 7 international patents and 19 pending international patent applications.  The patents and patent applications include claims to vaccine antigen conjugates, mixtures of vaccine antigen conjugates that makeup polyvalent vaccine candidates, processes for their preparation and their use as a vaccine. Two of the pending patent applications in the United States and 2 international patent applications have claims to human anti-sLea and anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies, nucleic acids encoding the human anti-sLea and anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies, processes for their preparation and their use as therapeutic agents.
  
  Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of anti-fungal agents.
  
  We believe that we have a sufficient intellectual property position and substantial know-how relating to the development and commercialization of our vaccine and monoclonal antibody-based candidates in the markets described herein, consisting of patents or patent applications that we have licensed from MSK or that we have filed ourselves. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology.
  
  Our objective is to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to our vaccine and monoclonal antibody programs. We intend to pursue, maintain, and defend patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business.
  
  Marketing and Sales
  We currently do not have an internal sales force and do not intend to commercialize on our own any of our product candidates that receive FDA approval.  We intend to license, or enter into strategic alliances with, larger companies in the biopharmaceutical businesses, which are equipped to manufacture, market and/or sell our products, if any, through their well-developed manufacturing capabilities and distribution networks. We intend to license some or all of our worldwide patent rights to more than one third party to achieve the fullest development, marketing and distribution of any products we develop.
 Manufacturing and Raw Materials
  We currently use, and expect to continue the use of, contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates. Our contract manufacturers are subject to extensive governmental regulation. Regulatory authorities in our markets require that pharmaceutical products be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with current cGMPs. We intend to establish a quality control and quality assurance program, which will include a set of standard operating procedures and specifications designed to ensure that our products are manufactured in accordance with cGMPs, and other applicable domestic and foreign regulations.
  We currently do not have any clinical or commercial antibody-based therapeutic manufacturing capabilities. We may or may not manufacture the products we develop, if any. We intend to use contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates.
   Competition
  The drug development and medical diagnostic industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition.  Our competitors include development and diagnostic companies that have significantly more financial, technical, and marketing resources.   In addition, there are a significant number of biotechnology companies working on evolving technologies that may supplant our technology or make it obsolete.  Academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and may commercialize product candidates either on their own or through joint ventures that compete with one or more of our product candidates.  We are aware of certain development projects for products to prevent or treat certain diseases targeted by us.  The existence of these potential products or other products or treatments of which we are not aware, or products or treatments that may be developed in the future, may adversely affect the desirability and commercial success of any product candidate for which we receive FDA approval.
   
-7-




  
 There are a number of companies working in the area of human antibody development and imaging that could compete in similar clinical areas, including disease detection, therapeutic response monitoring and minimal disease detection.  These companies include AbCellera Biologics, Inc., Agenus Inc., Atreca, Inc., Immunomedics, Inc., Theraclone Sciences Inc., and Trellis Bioscience.
   Government Regulation
  
  In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority and failure to abide by applicable regulatory requirements can result in administrative or judicial sanctions being imposed on us, including warning letters, refusals of government contracts, clinical holds, civil penalties, injunctions, restitution, disgorgement of profits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of approval, refusal to approve pending applications, and criminal prosecution.
 FDA Approval Process
  
  We believe that our product candidates will be regulated by the FDA as drugs. No manufacturer may market a new drug until it has submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the FDA, and the FDA has approved it. The steps required before the FDA may approve an NDA generally include:
  
    ●
 preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted in compliance with FDA’s good laboratory practice requirements;

 
    ●
 development, manufacture and testing of active pharmaceutical product and dosage forms suitable for human use in compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or GMP;

 
    ●
 the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;

 
    ●
 adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its specific intended use(s);

 
    ●
 the submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA; and

 
    ●
 FDA review and approval of the NDA.

 
  Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. We must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before we may commence human clinical trials. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after its receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions before that time about the conduct of the proposed trials. In such a case, we must work with the FDA to resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board for approval. An institutional review board may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the institutional review board’s requirements or may impose other conditions.
  
  Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to humans under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, though the phases may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects, the drug is usually tested for safety (adverse effects), dosage tolerance and pharmacologic action, as well as to understand how the drug is taken up by and distributed within the body. Phase 2 usually involves studies in a limited patient population (individuals with the disease under study) to:
  
    ●
 evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted conditions;

 
    ●
 determine dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage as well as other important information about how to design larger Phase 3 trials; and

 
    ●
 identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.

  Phase 3 trials generally further evaluate clinical efficacy and test for safety within an expanded patient population. The conduct of the clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with good clinical practice regulations and guidance.
  
  The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. We may also suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds.
  
  The results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including the manufacture and composition of the product candidate, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. If the NDA contains all pertinent information and data, the FDA will “file” the application and begin review. The FDA may “refuse to file” the NDA if it does not contain all pertinent information and data. In that case, the applicant may resubmit the NDA when it contains the missing information and data. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of new drug applications. Most such applications for non-priority drug products are reviewed within 10 months. The review process, however, may be extended by FDA requests for additional information, preclinical or clinical studies, clarification regarding information already provided in the submission, or submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. The FDA may refer an application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured and will not approve the product candidate unless GMP compliance is satisfactory. FDA also typically inspects facilities responsible for performing animal testing, as well as clinical investigators who participate in clinical trials. The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional testing or information. The FDA may also limit the indications for use and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
  
  The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and our product candidates may not be approved on a timely basis, if at all. The time and expense required to perform the clinical testing necessary to obtain FDA approval for regulated products can frequently exceed the time and expense of the research and development initially required to create the product. The results of preclinical studies and initial clinical trials of our product candidates are not necessarily predictive of the results from large-scale clinical trials, and clinical trials may be subject to additional costs, delays or modifications due to a number of factors, including difficulty in obtaining enough patients, investigators or product candidate supply. Failure by us to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals or in complying with requirements could adversely affect the commercialization of product candidates and our ability to receive product or royalty revenues.
  
  Other Regulatory Requirements
  
  After approval, drug products are subject to extensive continuing regulation by the FDA, which include company obligations to manufacture products in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, maintain and provide to the FDA updated safety and efficacy information, report adverse experiences with the product, keep certain records and submit periodic reports, obtain FDA approval of certain manufacturing or labeling changes, and comply with FDA promotion and advertising requirements and restrictions. Failure to meet these obligations can result in various adverse consequences, both voluntary and FDA-imposed, including product recalls, withdrawal of approval, restrictions on marketing, and the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties against the NDA holder. In addition, later discovery of previously unknown safety or efficacy issues may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or NDA holder.
  
  We and any manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s GMP regulations. GMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet GMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We and any third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations.
  
  With respect to post-market product advertising and promotion, the FDA imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.

  Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
  
  Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
  
  Outside the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. At present, foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level, although within the European Union registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one European Union member state.
  
  We are also subject to various environmental, health and safety regulations including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous materials. From time to time, and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous materials.
  
  Orphan Drugs
  
  Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
  
  Non-U.S. Regulation
  
  Before our products can be marketed outside of the United States, they are subject to regulatory approval of the respective authorities in the country in which the product should be marketed. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices might not be approved for such product.
  
 In Europe, marketing authorizations may be submitted at a centralized, a decentralized or national level; however, the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid in all European Union member states. There can be no assurance that the chosen regulatory strategy will secure regulatory approval on a timely basis or at all.
  While we intend to market our products outside the United States in compliance with our respective license agreements, we have not made any applications with non-U.S. authorities and have no timeline for such applications or marketing.
