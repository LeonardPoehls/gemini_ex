Item 1.  BUSINESS
History and Development of Our Technology
CurAegis Technologies, Inc. (“CurAegis”, “the Company”) was incorporated as a New York business corporation in September 1996 under the name Torvec, Inc. The Company’s name was changed to CurAegis Technologies, Inc. in 2016 in connection with the establishment of its two business divisions. The CURA (Circadian User Risk Assessment) division is engaged in the fatigue management business and the Aegis division is engaged in the power and hydraulic business. 
 
The Company develops and markets advanced technologies in the areas of power, safety, wellness and hydraulic power. The Company is focused on the commercialization of a wellness and safety system (the CURA System including the myCadian watch) and a uniquely designed hydraulic pump that will be smaller, lighter and more efficient than current technology. The Company has not had any significant revenue-producing operations.  
  
The Company has created the CURA System to market products that reduce fatigue risk in the workplace and help individuals manage their sleep and improve alertness. The CURA System consists of the following:
 

● | the myCadian watch and app,
--+----------------------------


● | real-time alertness monitoring,
--+--------------------------------


● | the Group Wellness Index and
--+-----------------------------


● | the Z-Coach Wellness Program.
--+------------------------------

 
The Aegis hydraulic pump technology has been designed to bring to the marketplace a unique concept in hydraulic pumps and motors that will be:
 

● | smaller and lighter than conventional pumps and motors,
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | more efficient,
--+----------------


● | as reliable,
--+-------------


● | price competitive, and
--+-----------------------


● | unique in its ability to scale larger, allowing more powerful pumps and motors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
It is important to note, regarding both the CURA and Aegis products, that the cycle time from the initiation of the sales process to revenue realization can be highly variable especially as a start-up entity. In addition to the activities to be undertaken to implement our plan of operations, we may expand and/or refocus our activities depending upon future circumstances and developments.

CURA Division: the myCadian ™ watch, the CURA™ System, and Z-Coach™ e-learning
The Company’s CURA division is developing a proprietary technology and suite of products designed to (i) measure the decrease in a person’s alertness and (ii) to train individuals on how to improve alertness levels. The CURA™ System and the myCadian™ watch enable the user and third parties to anticipate and avert undesired or disastrous situations caused by the degradation of alertness. With the information provided from the CURA™ software analytics, employees can work with Z-Coach, our proprietary sleep training and education solution to correct sleep issues and improve overall wellness.   
 
CurAegis has been engaged in validation testing with a number of sleep study experts and neurologists in connection with the introduction of our new technologies. The Company believes a solutions approach can be created to indicate a “degradation of alertness” and thus give immediate and important information to the user and other parties. These degradations can be caused by drowsiness, alcohol or other drugs, sickness, psychological problems and thought distractions. Action taken upon a warning of a change in alertness will lead to a better and safer environment. The myCadian™ watch paired with the CURA™ System is a real-time alertness and monitoring system that addresses sleep and fatigue management solutions. This is especially important when an individual’s alertness is essential in properly performing tasks, fulfilling responsibilities and averting disasters. The Company has filed for patent protection for these inventions.
  
The myCadian™ watch is a wearable device developed using physiological monitoring hardware and our proprietary CURA™ software that predicts and detects a degradation of alertness in a user and reveals sleep and fatigue problems. The CURA™ System will include:
 

● | a proprietary tool that combines signal processing and pattern recognition to guide users and third parties about the alertness of the wearer,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a risk assessment that identifies the degradation of alertness potentially affecting the wearer’s ability to perform tasks,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a comprehensive assessment for wellness, alertness and sleep,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | real-time reporting that distills complex data into actionable information on mobile and desktop platforms,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | predictive reporting for a user to take action when alertness begins to wane, before fatigue becomes dangerous,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | flexible settings to provide employers a customized CURA tool within existing safety definitions and to create protocols for a unique environment, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | pricing that makes it affordable across a broad-based workforce.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company estimates the possible market opportunity for the CURA System and the myCadian watch at approximately 700 million users worldwide.
 
The Z-Coach tool is a critical component of the CURA System and was originally created by highly respected fatigue management scientists. We acquired Z-Coach in September 2015. Z-Coach learning topics include: Risks and Costs of Fatigue, Fundamentals of Sleep, Fatigue Mitigation and Countermeasures. Z-Coach participants gain an awareness of the dangers inherent in the lack of sleep and learn to utilize lifestyle tools to make changes to improve their health, mood, productivity and safety.
 
The first Z-Coach module, Z-Coach Aviation, was designed for aviation professionals, from flight and ground crews, to scheduling, dispatch, administration and management. Z-Coach Aviation was first offered for sale in the first quarter of 2016.  During 2016, the Company completed the design of the Z-Coach Pro module which will be marketed to a broad range of organizations for fatigue learning and mitigation as well as modules tailored to the trucking and busing industry. Future versions of the Z-Coach learning modules will include training for first responders, 911 operations and other municipal employee groups as well as to medical industries. These industry-specific Z-Coach modules will be included in the launch of the CURA™ System and the myCadian watch. 
 
Aegis Division: Hydraulic Pump
The development of the Aegis hydraulic pump has taken on added significance in light of U.S. government emissions regulations for off road diesel engines. To help achieve these standards, companies are attempting to run diesel engines, and their hydraulic pumps, at lower rotational speeds. This requires larger displacement hydraulic pumps to be installed to compensate for the decrease in rotational speed. Among other advantages, the Aegis hydraulic pump technology allows a larger displacement pump to fit into the same or smaller footprint than that of existing pumps. This enables manufacturers to keep the current equipment layout without the need for expensive modifications to accommodate larger hydraulic pumps.

Since 2012, we have invested in software, test equipment and personnel to enhance our development efforts and began a design of the hydraulic pump to improve the overall performance while maintaining the advantages we have in size and weight. We have built an internal testing facility, which would have otherwise required third party testing fees and support. Our engineering and design team has progressively made adjustments to the sealing technology and each change has resulted in an improvement in the measured efficiency of the pump. We have filed for patent protection for our novel non-rotating group pump concept, and we are also working on additional patents as a result of engineering breakthroughs in our design process. 
  
We will continue to design modifications to enhance the overall pump technology. Although there is still much to be done, we continue to be extremely encouraged by our testing.
 
In addition to the activities to be undertaken to implement our plan of operation detailed above, we may expand and/or refocus our marketing activities depending upon future circumstances and developments. Information regarding the Company and all of our inventions, including regular updates on technological and business developments, can be found on our website, www.CurAegis.com. The website and its contents are not incorporated by reference into this report.
      
Competition, Industry and Market Acceptance
Competition in both the wearable device market and the hydraulic device market is, and is expected to remain, intense. The competition ranges from development stage companies to major domestic and international companies, many of which have financial, technical, marketing, sales, manufacturing, distribution and other resources significantly greater than ours. As we commercialize our technologies and begin to sell product, we expect to compete on the basis of performance, uniqueness of design, reliability, and price. There can be no assurance that our technologies and products will not be rendered obsolete by developments in competing technologies that are currently under development or that may be developed in the future or that our competitors could market competing products that obtain market acceptance more rapidly than ours.
  
We believe that the technologies we are developing have significant advantages relative to similar products manufactured in the worldwide wearable device and hydraulic device marketplaces. With respect to our mechanical device technologies, we believe that our development efforts represent a paradigm shift with respect to presently known technology. With respect to our wearable device technology, we believe that our development efforts are focused on a market that is seeking a better solution to predicting an individual’s level of alertness. Although we have not yet generated revenues from the commercialization of our technologies, we are focusing our efforts toward those areas where we believe we can get to market quickly and successfully. 
 
Patents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks
Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology, products and manufacturing processes. We principally rely upon patent, trademark, trade secrets and contract law to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary information, there can be no assurance that others will not either develop the same or similar information independently or obtain access to our proprietary information. In addition, there can be no assurance that we would prevail if we asserted our intellectual property rights against third parties, or that third parties will not successfully assert infringement claims against us in the future.
 
We currently hold patents and have a number of patent applications in process in various countries including the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, China, India and South Korea.
 
All key employees are required to enter into agreements providing for confidentiality and the assignment of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us. These agreements also contain certain noncompetition and non-solicitation provisions effective during the employment term and for varying periods thereafter depending on position and location. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enforce these agreements. All of our employees agree to abide by the terms of a Code of Ethics policy that provides for the confidentiality of certain information received during the course of their employment.
 
Trademarks are an important aspect of our business. The following are our registered trademarks: CurAegis®, myCadian™, CurAegis™, CURA™ and Z-Coach™.
