Business is awarded as a result of the Company's ability to successfully bid on and win the production and supply of parts for models that will be newly introduced to the market by the OEMs. 
Raw Materials 
The primary raw materials required for the Company's operations are hot-rolled and cold-rolled coated steel, rolled-aluminum and aluminum and magnesium ingots. The Company obtains steel from a number of primary steel producers and steel service centers. The majority of the steel is purchased through customers' steel buying programs. Under these programs, the Company purchases steel at the price that its customers negotiated with the steel suppliers. The Company's most significant steel suppliers are AK Steel, ArcelorMittal, Kenwal Steel Corporation, SSAB Swedish Steel Corporation, Steel Technologies, Tata Steels and U.S. Steel. The Company takes ownership of the steel in many instances; however, the customers are generally responsible for commodity price fluctuations. Most of the steel owned by the Company is purchased domestically. A portion of the Company's steel products and processing services are provided to customers on a toll processing basis. Under these arrangements, the Company charges a specified fee for operations performed without acquiring ownership of the steel and being burdened with the attendant costs of ownership and risk of loss. Through centralized purchasing, the Company attempts to purchase raw materials at the lowest competitive prices for the quantity purchased. The amount of steel available for processing is a function of the production levels of primary steel producers.
For the Company's aluminum and magnesium, used in the CastLight™ product brand, the cost of raw materials is handled in one of two ways. The primary method used by the Company is to secure quarterly purchase commitments based on customer releases and then pass the quarterly price changes to those customers utilizing published metal indexes. The second method used by the Company is to adjust prices monthly, based on a referenced metal index plus additional material cost spreads agreed to by the Company and its customers. Primary aluminum alloys are used in our proprietary "Thin Tech" castings processes, which allow heat treat and enhanced mechanical properties. The primary supplier for the company is Rio Tinto Alcan. Secondary smelting is the process of recycling aluminum, which has a positive impact environmentally and economically. These types of alloys are used in our conventional die casting process. The secondary aluminum suppliers for the Company include Allied Aluminum, Imperial Aluminum, Real Alloy Holding Incorporated, Spectro Alloy Corporation and Superior Aluminum Alloys. Magnesium alloy is originated from China and delivered from either Chinese magnesium producers or metal trading companies in Europe with pricing based on the Asian Metal price index.
Competition 
Shiloh competes in the laser welding, stamping, die casting and close-tolerance machining industries. Competitors within Shiloh’s main product brands vary. BlankLight® competitors include numerous metal blanking companies ranging in all sizes, including raw material manufacturers and customers. Welded blank competition in North America is primarily comprised of TWB Company LLC and ArcelorMittal USA. Most laser welded blank competitors are affiliated with raw material or distribution providers. Competition for sales of automotive stamping and assemblies is also intense. Primary StampLight™ competitors are Gestamp, L&W, Inc., Flex-n-Gate Corporation, Midway Products Group Inc., Narmco Group and Kirchhoff Automotive Group. CastLight™ competitors include Bocar Group, Cosma International (a Magna Company), Georg Fischer, Gnotec AB, KSM Casting Group, Madison Kipp Corporation (MKC), Meridian (subsidiary of Wangfeng Auto Holdings Group), Nemak, Pace Industries, RCM Industries and Ryobi Aluminum Casting (USA), Inc., which are all competing for a growing number of automotive projects. In almost all instances, Shiloh competes through its main strategies of "Lightweighting without compromise®" and "Lightweighting with Benefits®", which provides the Company with the ability to provide solutions that do not compromise part integrity such as performance, safety, sound and efficiency. Development and design optimization to lightweight products allow customers to achieve vehicle weight, fuel economy and/or ride and handling targets while favorably impacting the environment.
Joint Ventures
As of October 31, 2016, the Company had one joint venture in China. Operating activities have been insignificant and are not yet consolidated in the Company's statement of operations.

Employees 
As of October 31, 2016, the Company had approximately 3,100 employees. Organized labor unions represent approximately 20% of the Company's U.S. hourly employees and approximately 90% of the Company's non-U.S. employees. 
Each of the Company's unionized manufacturing facilities has its own labor agreement with its own expiration date. As a result, no contract expiration date affects more than one facility. 
Backlog 
A significant portion of the Company's business pertains to automobile platforms for various model years. Orders against these platforms are subject to releases by the customer and are not considered firm orders. Backlog, therefore, is not a meaningful indicator of future performance. 
Seasonality 
The Company's business is moderately seasonal because many North American OEM customers close assembly plants for periods in June and July for model year changeovers and for additional periods during the December and January holiday season. For Europe, July and August and additional periods during December and January are lower volume months due to customer shutdown and the holiday season. Shut-down periods in the rest of world vary by country. Historically, the Company's sales and operating profits have been strongest in the second and fourth quarters. For additional information, refer to the Company's quarterly financial results contained in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this report. 
Environmental Matters 
The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air, discharges to waterways and generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. 
The Company is also subject to laws and regulations that can require the remediation of contamination that exists at current or former facilities. In addition, the Company is subject to other federal and state laws and regulations regarding health and safety matters. The majority of the Company's production facilities have permits and licenses allowing and regulating air emissions and water discharges. While the Company believes that at the present time its production facilities are in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations, these laws and regulations are constantly evolving, and it is impossible to predict whether compliance with these laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Company in the future. 
ISO 14001 is a voluntary international standard issued in September 1996 by the International Organization for Standardization. ISO 14001 identifies the elements of an Environmental Management System ("EMS") necessary for an organization to effectively manage its effect on the environment. The ultimate objective of the standard is to integrate the EMS with overall business management processes and systems so that environmental considerations are a routine part of business decisions.  The majority of the Company's facilities are certified to the ISO 14001 standard and is actively working with the remaining facilities for improved environmental performance. The Company has completed the certification process at each of its manufacturing facilities to the ISO/TS 16949 standard, which is the global benchmark for an international quality management system ("QMS") in the automotive industry.  This certification is a market requirement for doing business in the automotive industry.
Research and Development
 The Company performs research, development, design and other engineering activities for the primary reasons:

• | to provide solutions for customers;


• | to integrate the Company's leading technologies into advanced products and processes;


• | to provide engineering support for all of the Company's manufacturing sites; and


• | to provide technological expertise in engineering and design development.

Along with Shiloh’s global manufacturing locations, the Company maintains technical centers in Asia (Shanghai, China), Europe (Gothenburg, Sweden) and in North America (Valley City, Ohio and Plymouth, Michigan). Furthermore, the Company has Sales and Engineering Offices in the United Kingdom (Evesham, England) and Germany (Munich).  Each of the Company’s 
 5

business units is engaged in engineering, research and development efforts working closely with customers to develop custom solutions to meet their needs.
Intellectual Property
The Company holds 80 issued patents on a worldwide basis, including 38 granted US patents and in excess of 54 patent applications in process. Of the approximately 90 patents and patent applications, approximately 46% are in production use and/or are licensed to third parties, and the remaining 54% are being considered for future production use or provide a strategic technological benefit to the Company. The Company does not materially rely on any single patent, nor will the expiration of any single patent materially affect the Company’s business. The Company’s current patents expire over various periods into the year 2032. The Company is actively introducing and patenting new technology to replace formerly patented technology before the expiration of the existing patents. In the aggregate, the Company's worldwide patent portfolio is materially important to its business because it enables the Company to achieve technological differentiation from its competitors. The Company also maintains more than 35 active trademark registrations and applications worldwide. In excess of 90% of these trademark registrations and applications are in commercial use by the Company or are licensed to third parties.
Segment and Geographic Information 
The Company conducts its business and reports its information as one operating segment - Automotive and Commercial Vehicles. The Chief Operating Decision Maker has been identified as the Senior Leadership Team ("SLT"), which includes all Vice Presidents plus the Chief Executive Officer of the Company as this team has the final authority over performance assessment and resource allocation decisions. In determining that one operating segment is appropriate, the Company considered the nature of the business activities, the existence of managers responsible for the operating activities and information presented to the Board of Directors for its consideration and advice. Customers and suppliers are substantially the same in the automotive and commercial vehicle industry.
Financial information regarding Company geographic mix is contained in Note 20 - Business Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this report.
