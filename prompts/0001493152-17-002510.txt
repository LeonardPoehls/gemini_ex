We conduct our operations through two primary business segments: Cinema and Digital Media. Approximately 53%, 61%, and 62% of our sales were from the Cinema segment for the years ended 2016, 2015, and 2014 respectively. 
 
Strategy
 
Pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into with Fundamental Global Investors, LLC and its affiliated funds to settle a pending proxy contest, the Company elected a new Board of Directors at its 2015 Annual Meeting of stockholders on May 13, 2015. On that same date, the newly composed Board appointed Mr. D. Kyle Cerminara, the Chief Executive Officer of Fundamental Global Investors, LLC, as the Company’s Chairman of the Board. The Board subsequently appointed Mr. Cerminara as Executive Chairman in September 2015 and as Chief Executive Officer in November 2015.
 
On January 18, 2016, the Board appointed Ndamukong Suh as a member of the Board, and on May 23, 2016 at the Company’s 2016 annual meeting of stockholders Lewis M. Johnson, President and Co-Founder and Partner of Fundamental Global Investors, LLC, was elected to the Board.
 
The new Board has undertaken a review and consideration of the Company’s strategy and has implemented changes in how the Company’s businesses are organized and how the Company makes investments and capital allocation decisions.
 
The new Board has implemented a strategy focused on making optimal capital allocation decisions across all of the Company’s businesses and investments. The Board intends to continue to invest in and grow the Company’s Cinema and Digital Media businesses. At the same time, the Board intends to consider and make investments in other industries that are expected to produce higher returns on invested capital. This may involve investments in public companies or the complete acquisitions of other businesses, which may be within or outside of the Cinema and Digital Media markets. Investments in public companies may involve the Company taking control positions or seeking to effectuate positive change through board representation or other shareholder activism.
 
In connection with its review of the Cinema and Digital Media businesses, on November 2, 2015 the Board promoted Ray F. Boegner, who has been a Senior Vice President with the Company since 1997, to the newly created position of President of the Cinema business and hired Stephen L. Schilling as the President of the Digital Media business. The Board has implemented zero-based budgeting for these businesses and has taken steps to eliminate excess costs where appropriate. The Board has also undertaken to add talent and additional resources to these businesses where opportunities have been identified for growth or improvement in these businesses.
 
The Company now holds investments in a number of public companies. These investments currently include RELM Wireless Corporation (NYSE MKT: RWC), a manufacturer of two-way wireless radio communications equipment, 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PIH), a provider of property and casualty insurance in the States of Louisiana and Texas, and Itasca Capital Ltd. (TSX Venture: ICL), a holding company that holds a majority position in Limbach Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: LMB), a leading commercial provider of HVAC construction and related services. As of March 10, 2017, the Company holds approximately 8.31% of the outstanding stock of RELM Wireless Corporation, approximately 17.43% of the outstanding stock of 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc., and approximately 32.30% of the outstanding stock of Itasca Capital Ltd.
 
In some cases, funds managed by Fundamental Global Investors, LLC may acquire positions in the same public companies as the Company. Fundamental Global Investors’ funds currently hold positions in both RELM Wireless Corporation and 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc.
 
In addition to the Company’s two operating businesses and investments in public companies, the Board expects to consider investments and transactions in other areas that it believes are likely to increase returns to shareholders, such as continued stock buybacks and monetizing physical or other assets held by the company.
 
The Board expects that over time the Company will be further transformed into a holding company with ownership of and investments in diverse businesses.
 
Fundamental Global Investors, LLC, the funds that it manages, its other affiliates, and the directors and officers of the Company together currently hold approximately 34.4% of the Company’s outstanding stock.

Operating Segments
 
Cinema
 
Overview
 
We provide a full range of products and services to the theatre exhibition industry from the design and installation of new theatre exhibition systems and related equipment to complete film-to-digital theatre conversion services. The systems include a wide spectrum of premier audio-visual products and accessories such as: digital projectors, state of the art projection screens, servers and library management systems, menu boards, flat panel displays, and sound systems.
 
We market and sell directly to theatre exhibitors, as well as through certain domestic and international Value Added Resellers (VAR’s). Over the course of our 80-year history, we have developed ongoing customer relationships with a large portion of the theatre owners in the United States and a number of the major theatre owners internationally. Our sales and marketing staff principally develop business by maintaining regular personal contact with our established customer relationships, including conducting site visits. In our sales and marketing efforts, we emphasize our value proposition of providing the broadest range of products and services delivered by one of the industry’s largest technical service teams, which provides a significant resource to our clients in managing the complexities of digital technology in the cinema exhibition industry. Our sales and marketing professionals have extensive experience with the Company’s product lines and have long-term relationships throughout the industry.
 
Products
 
Screens — We manufacture multiple standard and large format 2D and 3D screens for cinema and special venue applications through our ISO-certified manufacturing facility in Canada. There are certain digital 3D applications, such as the technology by RealD, that require unique “silver” screens that we manufacture. In addition, we purchased Peintures Elite, Inc. in 2013, the manufacturer of coatings that have been exclusive to our Company in the manufacture of our screens. This relatively small acquisition positioned us to retain the exclusive rights to this coating and to continue producing our unique screens. We are constantly innovating to set new standards within the screen industry, and in 2013 we developed the new Premium HGA screen that diffuses light more evenly over the entire screen surface, thereby reducing the formation of so-called “hot spots.”
 
Projectors — Through distribution agreements with NEC and BARCO, we distribute DLP Cinema projectors in the Americas. Both manufacturers of the projectors use the DLP cinema technology from Texas Instruments. NEC offers DLP Cinema projectors ranging from their NC900 projector for screens up to 31 feet wide to the NC3240S, which is a 4K projector designed for screens up to 105 feet wide. BARCO offers DLP Cinema projectors ranging from their DP2K-10SX projector for screens up to 33 wide feet to the DP4K-32B cinema projector, which is an ultra-bright enhanced 4K cinema projector for screens up to 105 feet wide.
 
Servers — Through a formal distribution agreement with GDC Technology (USA), LLC, we distribute GDC’s line of digital cinema servers in North and South America. We also distribute their servers in certain other areas of the world under less formal arrangements. In addition, we distribute servers for other server manufacturers, including those manufactured by Dolby. Digital servers and the related integrated media block are used by our customers for the storage and delivery of digital movie content.
 
Audio Systems — We distribute a range of state of the art digital audio systems, including surround and 3D sound technologies from the following manufacturers: Dolby, Barco USL, JBL and QSC. Our technicians are certified by each manufacturer to install, service and maintain these and other audio systems.
 
Additional Projection Products — We also manufacture or distribute certain third-party accessories, which when coupled with the cinema projector, server and integrated media block, can fully outfit and automate a projection booth. The significant accessories include, but are not limited to, library management systems, automation products, pedestals, 3D accessories, lenses and lamps.
 
Markets
 
Cinema — Our non-exclusive distribution agreements with NEC and BARCO allow us to market digital projectors in North and South America, including the Caribbean. In China we have distribution rights to sell NEC and BARCO and can distribute NEC products in Hong Kong and certain other areas of Asia. We do not have any territorial restrictions for any of our other products and services.

Competition
 
Digital Projection Equipment — The markets for our products in the cinema segment have been highly competitive during the analog-to-digital cinema conversion. The primary competitive factors are price, product quality, features and customer support. Competition in the digital cinema equipment market includes one other licensed original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the Texas Instruments’ DLP cinema technology besides our partners NEC and BARCO: Christie Digital Systems. We also compete with SONY, which uses its own 4K digital cinema technology.
 
Screens — While there are numerous screen manufacturing companies in the world, the primary competitor in the worldwide cinema screen market is Harkness Screens. Competitive factors include product performance characteristics, quality, availability and price.
 
Digital Media
 
Overview
 
The Company delivers solutions and services across two primary markets: digital out-of-home and cinema. These markets are served through the capabilities that it has developed from the acquisition of Convergent in 2013 and from Strong Technical Services ( “STS”) respectively. While there is digital signage and cinema equipment sold within this segment, the primary focus of this segment is providing solutions and services to our customers.
Solutions
 
Digital Signage — Our industry-first Digital Signage as a Service gives customers an end-to-end solution that includes hardware, software, content distribution, management, network monitoring and field services, all for a single monthly fee. Our “as-a-service” model lowers up-front capital costs, allows customers to scale more easily and allows them to ‘turn on’ or ‘turn-off’ features as needed. It also eliminates the risk of investing in quickly changing technologies, removes the complexity and lessens resource burdens typically associated with traditional digital signage systems. We primarily market our solutions to large businesses in North America that do not have the resources, expertise or desire to create, manage and maintain their digital signage system internally. Customers typically require deployment across many locations and utilize digital signage to increase product sales, improve the consumer experience, enhance their brand or engage their audience.
 
Enterprise Video — We provide video communication services and solutions, including design, integration, monitoring, maintenance and installation for the government and corporate markets. These solutions provide enterprises with the infrastructure necessary to communicate, collaborate, train and educate employees.
 
Products and Services
 
Digital Signage as a Service (DSaaS) Platform – Our platform leverages internally developed and third-party software to automate the customer’s digital signage workflow, including from content creation, approval, storage and management, network deployment, monitoring, case management and incident resolution. Since it is cloud-based, it provides inherent scalability to enable customers to expand or contract their network. The DSaaS platform supports a wide range of applications – all of which are managed through a single user interface. New features and functionality are frequently added, both through the efforts of our in-house software development team and integration with an ever-growing ecosystem of third-party applications.
 
Content Creation — We provide creative services to digital signage clients that include media strategy, content design and production. Our creative services team develops custom content to support the branding and marketing initiatives of each client.
 
Content Management and Distribution — Content management provided to ensure accurate playback at the right place and at the right time based on a number of factors such as geography, site characteristics, location within a site or consumer demographics. We utilize our DSaaS platform for the management and distribution of content. Content is prepared, scheduled and centrally distributed from our cloud infrastructure.

Network Operations Center — Our Network Operations Centers (NOC), staffed by software engineers and systems techs, operate 24/7/365 and provide technical support to our customers to meet Service Level Agreements (“SLA”). From each location in Alpharetta, GA and Omaha, NE, we are able to monitor our customers’ networked equipment remotely, often providing proactive solutions to systems issues before they cause system failures. Our remote services include systems monitoring and maintenance, software upgrades and system repairs. By utilizing NOC personnel to solve customer issues whenever possible, we eliminate travel time and expenses normally incurred by sending a technician onsite for repairs. Many issues that do not involve parts replacement or physical contact with the hardware can be handled remotely using our remote assistance technologies.
 
Service and Maintenance — We supply digital installations and after-sale maintenance services. Our onsite technicians work closely with our NOC staff to resolve systems issues that cannot be fixed remotely; they are certified to install and service a wide array of digital and audio equipment from a number of manufacturers. We offer cabling, wiring, installation and maintenance services for digital menu boards and other digital equipment on ad hoc, as-needed basis. We also offer long-term contractual service packages for maintenance and repairs to a wide range of installed digital equipment for customers. These long-term contractual service packages provide our Company with recurring revenue.
 
Network Connectivity – We offer nationwide Internet connectivity to fulfill content distribution and network management functions. We utilize third party providers for traditional terrestrial connectivity, as well as wireless service across North America.
 
Measurement and Analytics – We offer the tools and resources to measure the impact of digital signage solutions. We develop measurement criteria, establish benchmarks and identify control mechanisms to test the effectiveness of such solutions during proof of concept and full rollout scenarios.
 
Markets
 
Digital Out-of-Home – The Digital Out-of-Home (“DOOH”) advertising market is a subset of the overall OOH advertising market that includes in-store digital displays and interactive promotion kiosks. DOOH marketing campaigns consist of a network of digital displays that are centrally managed and target both mobile and captive customers outside the home. We are primarily focused on pursuing DOOH communication opportunities within the retail, banking, entertainment and corporate markets.
 
Enterprise Video Solutions – The Enterprise Video Solutions (“EVS”) market consists of customers seeking corporate video communications, employee training and system monitoring solutions. We are primarily focused on pursuing EVS opportunities within the government, banking, retail and corporate markets.
 
Cinema – The cinema market consists of theatre exhibitors both domestically and internationally. The Company’s foundation was built in the cinema exhibition industry and this market remains a key focus of our Company. We market and sell our services directly to theatre owners and through dealers or VAR networks. Our sales and marketing staff principally develop business by maintaining regular personal customer contact, including conducting site visits, while customer service and technical support functions are dispatched when needed.
 
Competition
 
There are many players in the Digital Out-of-Home market who have expertise in integration. Some of the key players include Diversified Media Group, Stratacache and Christie Digital.
 
The competition in the cinema service industry for installation, after-sale maintenance, and NOC services is primarily driven by the two largest cinema service companies, the Company and Christie Digital, although there are other smaller scale providers in the cinema market.
