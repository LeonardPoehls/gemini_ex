Overview
 We are a medical technology company focused on delivering superior patient and physician experiences through products designed for the minimally invasive treatment of chronic and recurrent sinusitis in both adult and pediatric patients. Our platform of products provides effective and easy-to-use solutions designed to simplify everything from diagnosis and patient selection, to complex case revisions and post-operative care. Our three core product lines, XprESS Multi-Sinus Dilation Systems, MiniFESS Surgical Instruments, and FocESS Imaging & Navigation, are designed to enable ear, nose and throat, or ENT, physicians to conveniently and comfortably perform a broad range of procedures in the ENT physician office and to simplify operating room-based treatment. When used as a stand-alone therapy in the physician’s office, our XprESS balloon sinus dilation products are the only devices proven in a sufficiently powered prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to be as effective as functional endoscopic sinus surgery, or FESS, the primary surgical treatment for chronic and recurrent sinusitis. Patients treated with our products in this trial in the ENT physician office also experienced faster recovery, less bleeding at discharge, less use of prescription pain medication and fewer post-procedure debridements than patients receiving FESS. We estimate that physicians have treated over 150,000 patients with our XprESS products since the launch of the first XprESS product in February 2010.
 Our addressable patient population consists of a portion of patients who undergo FESS, as well as patients who fail medical management but do not undergo sinus surgery. We estimate the annual total addressable market for our products in the United States is approximately 690,000 patients, which, based on our estimate of the average revenue per procedure in the balloon sinus dilation market, represents an annual market opportunity of approximately $1.0 billion.
 We believe our minimally invasive balloon sinus dilation devices and additional sinus surgery products sold by us have facilitated a shift towards office-based treatment of chronic and recurrent sinusitis patients who are candidates for sinus surgery in the operating room. We believe this shift has been facilitated by our technology and clinical data, as well as procedure economics that are favorable to the healthcare system, patient and provider. Our XprESS family of products is used to treat patients with inflammation of the frontal, ethmoid, sphenoid and maxillary sinuses and is specifically designed for ease-of-use in the ENT physician office setting. Our XprESS family of products includes our XprESS Pro device, our XprESS LoProfile device and our XprESS Ultra device. We derive a significant portion of our revenue from our XprESS family of products. Our research and development efforts are focused primarily on enhancing our XprESS family of products and broadening their indications for use, as well as developing new, related products.
 Product development and innovation are an important part of our strategy. In November 2015, we received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for a pediatric indication for our XprESS Multi-Sinus Dilation System, thereby expanding the patient population to include treatment of maxillary sinuses in patients two years and older, and treatment of the frontal and sphenoid sinuses in patients 12 years and older. We believe we are the only company to have received FDA clearance for balloon sinus dilation to treat the frontal and sphenoid sinuses in adolescents. 
 In 2016, we acquired and entered into an exclusive license for XeroGel nasal packing material, and we now manufacture and sell XeroGel product to hospitals, physician offices and ambulatory surgery centers, or ASCs. Prior to this transaction, we were the exclusive distributor of XeroGel nasal packing material in the United States. Also in 2016, we introduced several new products, including sterilization trays, Fiagon accessories, and, in the third quarter, our Cyclone Sinonasal Suction and Irrigation System. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated limited launches of our Entellus Medical Shaver System and our FocESS Wireless High Definition (HD) Camera System and completed full launches of both products in the first quarter of 2017. 
 We have a diverse customer base of ENT physicians, hospitals and ASCs, with no single customer accounting for more than 5% of our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016. Our customers are generally reimbursed by governmental and private health insurers for procedures using our products pursuant to reimbursement codes specific to the procedure and the setting. In November 2016, Medicare issued a final rule on the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System, or OPPS, for 2017 which includes a reduction of payments for certain outpatient procedures performed in the hospital when FESS is performed on more than two sinuses. The result is to bundle payments for multi-sinus surgery regardless of the number of sinuses being treated. On average, we expect most hospitals will experience a reduction in Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, reimbursement because the average number of sinuses being treated is more than two. As of December 2016, third-party payor insurance coverage for stand-alone balloon sinus dilation procedures is available for an estimated 230 million persons in the United States, which represents 80% of covered lives.
 In December 2016, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, provided positive guidance for use of our XprESS Multi-Sinus Dilation System in the United Kingdom, recommending it for use in patients with uncomplicated chronic sinusitis who do not have severe nasal polyposis. In these patients, NICE has asserted that, in comparison with FESS, our XprESS Multi-Sinus Dilation System works as well, is associated with faster recovery times and can more often be performed under local anesthesia. NICE provides evidence-based guidance and advice to the National Health Service in England and other public health and social care services to improve health and social care. The NICE guidance is specific to the XprESS Multi-Sinus Dilation System and 
 2


does not extend to any other balloon sinus dilation technology. NICE estimates that, by adopting our technology, the National Health Service in England may save up to £7.4 million per year by 2020.
 We currently sell our products through a direct sales force in the United States and United Kingdom and through international distributors in over 10 countries. As of December 31, 2016, we employed a total of 90 full quota-carrying representatives. We expect to continue to expand our sales force and staffing to further penetrate the sinusitis market. We also intend to continue to increase our presence outside the United States through expansion of our United Kingdom sales force and the addition of distributors. Financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is included in Note N of our consolidated financial statements.
 Overview of Sinusitis and the Market
 Chronic sinusitis is a common medical condition that, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, impacts approximately 12% of the adult population aged 18 and over in the United States, or approximately 29 million people based on 2013 U.S. Census Bureau data, making it more prevalent than asthma or heart disease. In addition to the adult population, based on research published in The Laryngoscope in 2006, we est
imate that approximately 6 million Americans under the age of 18 suffer from chronic sinusitis bringing the total U.S. prevalence to approximately 35 million. 
 We estimate the annual total addressable market for our products in the United States is approximately 690,000 patients, which, based on our estimate of the average revenue per procedure in the balloon sinus dilation market, represents an annual market opportunity of approximately $1.0 billion. Our addressable patient population consists of a portion of patients who undergo FESS, as well as patients who fail medical management but do not undergo sinus surgery. We believe that out of the adult patients aged 18 and over in the United States who are expected to undergo FESS procedures in 2016, approximately 55% are well-suited for office-based balloon treatment because they present with uncomplicated sinusitis and do not require a septoplasty procedure to correct a severely deviated septum and approximately 30% are well-suited for treatment with a hybrid balloon sinus dilation procedure in the operating room along with a FESS procedure due to the location and nature of their sinusitis. In addition, we believe that approximately 85% of the patients who fail medical management but do not undergo FESS represent a significant market opportunity, as these patients currently avoid sinus surgery, seek a non-surgical alternative procedure to FESS after fewer episodes of failed medical management, or are increasingly referred by primary care physicians to ENT physicians for their chronic sinusitis. We estimate this current market opportunity to be approximately 160,000 patients annually in the United States, and believe that patient population will increase and be amenable to balloon sinus dilation as the number of physicians trained on procedures and clinical evidence supporting the benefits of office-based balloon sinus dilation continues to grow.
 Sinuses are air-filled pockets within the bones of the face and skull. The four types of sinuses are frontal, ethmoid, sphenoid and maxillary. One of each type of sinus lies on each side of the face.

The sinuses are lined with soft, moist tissue, or mucosa, that is covered with a layer of mucus. Mucus moistens the nasal lining and protects the body from inhaled impurities such as dust, pollutants and bacteria. Each of the maxillary, sphenoid and frontal sinuses has a corresponding ostium, or opening, through which mucus drains. The ethmoid sinuses are a series of cells with multiple, often interconnected openings and drainage pathways. The surface tissues of the sinuses are covered with millions of cilia, which are small, hair-like structures that act in coordination to sweep the mucus through the ostium of each sinus cavity to the back of the throat. The drainage of mucus is a normal process that keeps the sinuses healthy.
 Sinusitis is inflammation of the sinus cavities that may be caused by infections, allergies or environmental factors, as well as structural issues such as blockage of an ostium. If one or more sinus drainage pathways becomes blocked, normal mucus drainage is prevented and damage to ciliary function may occur. There are three categories of sinusitis: acute, recurrent acute and chronic. Acute sinusitis is transient in nature and lasts less than four weeks. Recurrent acute sinusitis is a type of chronic sinusitis that involves four or more episodes of acute sinusitis over a 12-month period. Chronic sinusitis is more severe and lasts 12 weeks or longer. We refer to 
 3


recurrent acute sinusitis and chronic sinusitis together as chronic sinusitis. The symptoms of sinusitis include facial pain, pressure, nasal congestion, headaches, fatigue and loss of smell. When persistent, these symptoms can severely impact a patient’s day-to-day well-being, resulting in frequent doctor visits and can lead to reduced sleep function, chronic fatigue and depression. The condition significantly reduces work productivity, increases absenteeism and impairs daily activities.
 Chronic sinusitis is associated with substantial healthcare utilization and expenditure and ranks as one of the ten costliest physical health conditions, contributing to an estimated $8.6 billion in direct healthcare costs in the United States. The latest CDC ambulatory medical surveys estimated that chronic sinusitis resulted in 12.3 million physician visits annually in the United States in each of 2009 and 2010, of which an estimated 8.1 million were to primary care physicians, 2.8 million were to ENT physicians, and the remainder were to hospital outpatient facilities and emergency rooms. We estimate that the 2.8 million annual patient visits to ENT physicians in the United States represent approximately 1.23 million distinct patients seen annually by ENT physicians. Primary care and ENT physicians rely on medical management for first-line therapy to treat chronic sinusitis. In cases where patients remain symptomatic despite multiple rounds of medical management, a physician may recommend FESS or balloon sinus dilation combined with FESS, or in cases of uncomplicated chronic sinusitis, may recommend stand-alone balloon sinus dilation. Uncomplicated chronic sinusitis is sinus disease that does not include fungus, extensive polyps, or inflammation and infection of the bones below the sinus mucosa. We estimate that, of the 1.23 million adult patients aged 18 and over in the United States with chronic sinusitis who were expected to be seen by ENT physicians in 2015, 552,000 underwent FESS, while 493,000 had symptoms relieved by medical management and 188,000 failed medical management but elected not to undergo FESS.
 Current Treatments for Sinusitis and their Limitations
 The treatment of sinusitis is progressive in nature and involves therapies that attempt to achieve the most effective solution in the least invasive manner. Treatment typically begins with medical management, and if this is unsuccessful, an ENT physician may perform FESS or a balloon sinus dilation procedure to treat both symptoms and obstruction of the sinus drainage pathways.
 Medical Management
 Sinusitis patients often present with a sinus infection and nasal congestion. Therefore, first-line therapy typically involves the use of prescription medications, such as antibiotics and decongestants. If the condition persists, physicians may prescribe more aggressive medical management, including additional antibiotics, oral steroids or intra-nasal steroid sprays to reduce inflammation, or saline irrigations to loosen mucus. To facilitate increased delivery of steroids to inflamed sinus tissue, reduce symptoms and reduce recurrence of polyps, physicians may also prescribe off-label use of steroids added to nasal irrigation solutions.
 While medical management can be effective, its effect is often temporary, and it is unable to address the underlying anatomical issues such as chronically narrowed or obstructed sinus drainage pathways that may be contributing to the condition. Even where medical management is effective, prolonged medication use can give rise to undesirable side effects. For example, frequent use of antibiotics can lead to the development of antibiotic resistance and repeated use of decongestant sprays can cause nasal congestion rebound, or an increase in nasal congestion after stoppage of use. Similarly, prolonged use of oral steroids can produce potentially serious side effects such as aggressive behavior, sleeplessness, glaucoma, bone loss, weight gain, high blood pressure and psychosis. Medical management also represents an ongoing expense to patients and payors. Based upon published studies, we estimate that approximately 60% of chronic sinusitis patients who are seen by ENT physicians and receive medical management remain symptomatic.
 Sinus Surgery
 In cases where patients diagnosed with sinusitis are unresponsive to multiple rounds of medical management, an ENT physician may recommend surgical treatment. The primary surgical alternative is FESS, which attempts to open the sinus drainage pathways such as the ostia while attempting to preserve as much bone and sinus mucosa as possible. FESS is typically performed under general anesthesia in an operating room during a procedure that typically takes approximately two hours. During FESS, an ENT physician inserts an endoscope into the nasal cavity to view a patient’s anatomy. The physician typically uses rigid steel instruments and powered cutting tools to remove inflamed sinus tissue and underlying bone to create a larger passage through the nasal anatomy to the infected sinuses, where the physician then removes additional tissue and bone to open the sinus ostia. Surgeons may also perform additional surgery on a deviated nasal septum or enlarged turbinate, a bulbous structure in the nose that warms and humidifies air, in the nose to treat nasal obstruction or simply to gain surgical access to the sinuses. At the conclusion of the procedure, patients often have their nasal cavity packed with a material that acts as a spacer to prevent surgical adhesions and control bleeding. Patients typically require one or more follow-up debridement treatments in which the physician may remove more tissue, crusting, scabs or scar tissue at the area of surgery in order to keep the sinus drainage pathway open and promote proper healing.
 While FESS is often effective at treating chronic sinusitis, FESS results in irreversible changes to the anatomy and significant postoperative pain, discomfort and recovery time. In addition, postoperative debridement is unpleasant for the patient and costly to the healthcare system. Although FESS is the standard of care, approximately 7% to 12% of FESS patients require revision surgery, often as a result of ongoing inflammation and scarring associated with the procedure. Within the first year following a FESS procedure, 
 4


approximately 64% of patients experience recurrent symptoms. In addition, given the use of surgical tools in close proximity to the brain, eyes and other critical anatomy, the potential for significant complications is a concern of physicians and patients alike. The risks of FESS, particularly in the frontal sinuses, cause some ENT physicians to avoid performing surgery in the frontal sinus drainage pathway. Major complications, such as cerebral spinal fluid leaks, swelling of the eye or blindness, occur in approximately 1% of FESS procedures. We believe that patient concerns about undergoing sinus surgery, postoperative discomfort, multiple days of recovery time and potential complications can make patients hesitant to undergo FESS. As an example, in our REMODEL trial, 14 of 75 patients randomized to the FESS arm of the trial refused surgical treatment and withdrew from the study. Eight of these patients indicated they were withdrawing because they did not want to undergo surgical treatment, one indicated withdrawal because the person’s primary physician recommended not undergoing FESS, three indicated they were withdrawing due to other non-sinus medical conditions or a lack of time available for follow-up, and two were found to have exclusion criteria upon further review. Only two of 76 patients randomized to balloon sinus dilation indicated they were withdrawing before treatment because of not wanting the balloon procedure.
 Balloon Sinus Dilation
 Balloon sinus dilation was developed to provide patients with a minimally invasive, long lasting treatment alternative that was more effective than medical management, at least as safe and efficacious as FESS and that preserves sinus mucosa and future treatment options. By employing balloon sinus dilation as a non-surgical method to open blocked sinus pathways, balloon sinus dilation spares mucosa while increasing ventilation and mucus drainage, which preserves the natural function of the cilia and important natural anatomical structures, such as the uncinate process, which is a tissue bridge that prevents inhaled dust and bacteria from easily entering maxillary sinus ostia.
 Balloon sinus dilation can be performed as a stand-alone procedure using local anesthesia in the ENT physician office, typically in approximately one hour. In a typical office-based balloon sinus dilation procedure, the physician uses topical anesthetics followed by an injection to numb the patient’s sinus lining. Once a patient’s nasal passages and ostia are numb, the physician inserts a balloon sinus dilation product into the nose using endoscopic visualization, and guides the balloon device into a narrowed sinus drainage pathway. Some balloon sinus dilation products use a guide catheter and guidewire to direct the balloon into a sinus drainage pathway. In conjunction with placing the balloon into the ostium, the physician confirms the balloon device has correctly accessed the sinus, often using methods such as direct endoscopic visualization or transcutaneous visualization of light emanating from the tip of a balloon device or guidewire. The balloon is then inflated to a high pressure, resulting in fracture and remodeling of the bones underlying the sinus mucosa. For patients with multiple obstructed sinus drainage pathways, the physician may repeat the process of placement, confirmation and inflation in each affected sinus. Balloon sinus dilation can also be used with FESS performed under general anesthesia in the operating room.
 ENT physicians are increasingly treating more complicated sinusitis patients in the office with a procedure known as mini-FESS. This procedure combines office-based balloon sinus dilation of the obstructed sinus drainage pathways with limited excision of adjacent tissue, including polyp removal, removal of diseased ethmoid air cells, or reduction of enlarged turbinates. We expect the adoption of mini-FESS procedures will broaden the population of patients treatable with office-based balloon sinus dilation products, and will also facilitate use of our MiniFESS products, Fiagon Image Guidance System, or Fiagon IGS, Entellus Medical Shaver System and FocESS products. We believe this trend will be enhanced as ENT physicians prescribe on-label as well as off-label use of steroids in nasal irrigations to reduce polyp recurrence and promote healing following excision of sinus tissue.
 Despite the advantages of a minimally invasive balloon sinus dilation procedure, we believe its adoption has been limited by a number of historical factors that include:
  
• | initial perceptions among some ENT physicians that the primary indication for balloon sinus dilation was treatment of frontal sinuses in a hybrid procedure that added cost compared to FESS only;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reimbursement codes and payment for office-based stand-alone balloon sinus dilation did not come into effect until 2011, six years after sinus dilation balloons were initially launched;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | until 2013, there was limited clinical evidence to support the use of balloon sinus dilation in a broader patient population and as a stand-alone treatment in the ENT physician office; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a perception among some ENT physicians of patients’ inability to tolerate balloon sinus dilation procedures in the physician office setting.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, a limitation of balloon sinus dilation is that it does not remove irreversibly diseased sinus mucosa, which may be present in patients with sinusitis complicated by fungus, extensive polyps and infection of the bones below the sinus mucosa.

Our Competitive Strengths
 We are focused on the treatment of sinusitis, one of the most common medical conditions in the United States resulting in patient visits to physicians. We have a broad product line of minimally invasive technologies for diagnosing and treating sinusitis patients after failed medical management. Our platform of products provides effective and easy-to-use solutions and is designed to simplify everything from diagnosis and patient selection, to complex case revisions and post-operative care. Our products are intended to further transition the treatment of uncomplicated sinusitis from the operating room to the physician office setting. We believe our following competitive strengths will help drive further adoption of our products:

• | Focus on physician office treatment of sinusitis—We believe the majority of sinusitis patients who fail medical management can be treated in the physician office with a stand-alone, office-based balloon sinus dilation procedure. To facilitate the adoption of these procedures, we have focused our product development on creating diagnostic and treatment solutions that are effective, easy to perform and well-tolerated by an awake patient. We educate physicians about our clinical data, which demonstrates efficacy in a broad spectrum of patients who are well-suited for treatment in the ENT physician office setting and about the procedure economics that are favorable to the patient, provider and healthcare system.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Significant body of clinical data—We have developed a significant body of clinical data supporting the safety and effectiveness of our balloon sinus dilation products. We have sponsored one meta-analysis and eight clinical studies in which a total of 696 patients were treated with our products and followed to assess safety, and of which 538 patients were followed for an extended period of six, 12 or 24 months to assess long-term efficacy. Our clinical data shows clinically meaningful results across a broad set of clearly defined patient groups. Our REMODEL randomized trial demonstrated that when our balloon sinus dilation devices were used as a stand-alone therapy in the physician office setting, patients experienced similar efficacy rates, faster recovery times, less bleeding at discharge, less use of prescription pain medication and fewer post-procedure debridements than patients receiving FESS. Our XprESS Multi-Sinus Study further demonstrated the efficacy of our products in a broader population of chronic sinusitis patients. Additionally, one of the challenges associated with trans-nasal balloon treatment of the maxillary sinus is the lack of visualization of the ostia. We have completed a cadaver study that demonstrated our XprESS balloon sinus dilation device could consistently and effectively treat the maxillary ostia without puncturing tissue and creating a false channel into the sinus. We believe the data from the cadaver study is unique to our product and partially responsible for driving adoption of office-based balloon sinus dilation in treating maxillary sinuses, the sinus most commonly treated with FESS.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Competitive advantages over other balloon sinus dilation products—Our balloon sinus dilation products are intuitive and easy-to-use because they are placed into the diseased sinus like a sinus seeker, a tool commonly used by ENT physicians. Our XprESS family of devices provides depth markings and tactile feel with a controllable tip to allow a user to gently access the ostia and visualize the device insertion depth. Our XprESS products also have fewer components than other balloon sinus dilation products and come with a shaping tool that can bend our XprESS device so that a single device can be used to treat all diseased sinuses in a single procedure. For accessing the approach to the maxillary sinus, our XprESS Ultra provides a small profile, having a 1.5 millimeter diameter ball tip and an adjustable 135-degree angle, compared to a guide catheter used by our main competitor that is 107% larger in diameter and limited to a fixed 110-degree angle. Furthermore, in our XprESS devices, a slideable balloon is used, enabling the balloon to be kept out of the way when the device is advanced into a sinus opening, which allows the user to better visualize and enter the sinuses. Our XprESS products enable unique confirmation methods such as controlled excursion of trans-illuminated light to confirm entry into the frontal sinus, and for accessing the maxillary ostia, observation of the ball tip as it deflects or trans-illuminates the uncinate process, thereby enhancing the accuracy of sinus access. In addition, our XprESS Pro and LoProfile devices are both compatible with the Fiagon IGS, providing physicians an added method to confirm placement of the device in the sinuses. The Fiagon IGS offers a smaller footprint than traditional operating room-based image guidance systems, which we believe makes it ideally suited for adaptation to the ENT physician office. Our XprESS LoProfile and XprESS Ultra Multi-Sinus Dilation Systems provide further convenience for office users by having a self-contained, battery-powered light source, eliminating the need for a separate light cord or xenon lamp light source associated with competing product offerings.

• | Demonstrated to comfortably treat sinusitis patients—Our products are designed to provide patient comfort during office-based procedures. Four of our clinical studies demonstrate that awake patients treated in the physician office with our products are comfortable, with patient mean pain scores ranging from 1.8 to 3.2 on a zero to ten scale where zero is no pain. We also believe that our products facilitate comfortable patient treatment because, unlike our main competitor, they do not require the use of a guidewire that can contact the non-anesthetized interior of a treated sinus and cause patient discomfort.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Comprehensive and broad IP portfolio—As of December 31, 2016, we had 33 issued U.S. patents and 19 pending U.S. patent applications. Our intellectual property portfolio covers our current and anticipated future XprESS products with at least 13 issued U.S. patents, at least seven pending U.S. patent applications and multiple pending foreign applications.

 Our Products
 We have a broad product line of minimally invasive technologies for diagnosing and treating sinusitis patients after failed medical management. Our platform of products provides effective and easy-to-use solutions and is designed to simplify everything from diagnosis and patient selection, to complex case revisions and post-operative care. Our products are intended to further transition the treatment of uncomplicated sinusitis from the operating room to the physician office setting. Our XprESS Multi-Sinus Dilation family of devices and related tools have been specifically designed to enable easy access to the sinus cavities under endoscopic visualization, and provide confirmation of sinus location and device placement using multiple methods. These products facilitate the access and dilation of blocked sinus ostia and pathways in order to reestablish proper mucus transport and drainage with retained ciliary function. When used as a stand-alone therapy in the physician’s office, our XprESS balloon sinus dilation products are the only devices proven in a sufficiently powered prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to be as effective as FESS, the primary surgical treatment for chronic and recurrent sinusitis. Patients treated with our products in this trial in the ENT physician office also experienced faster recovery, less bleeding at discharge, less use of prescription pain medication and fewer post-procedure debridements than patients receiving FESS. Our array of other products are aimed at assisting in the evaluation and diagnosis of sinusitis and tools to facilitate the treatment of sinusitis and related conditions, and include our Light Fibers, MiniFESS tools and surgical instruments, and FocESS Imaging & Navigation tools, including FocESS Sinuscopes and our recently launched Cyclone Sinonasal Suction and Irrigation System, Entellus Medical Shaver System and our FocESS Wireless High Definition (HD) Camera System. Finally, the Fiagon IGS that we distribute is suited for allowing treatment of more complex cases in the physician’s office, and our XeroGel nasal packing material aids in the post-operative healing process.
 XprESS Multi-Sinus Dilation Product Family
 Our XprESS Multi-Sinus Dilation family of products consists of our XprESS Pro device, our XprESS LoProfile device and our XprESS Ultra device. The XprESS LoProfile device and the XprESS Ultra device are always sold with our LED Light Fiber. All of these disposable devices open an obstructed or narrowed drainage pathway of a sinus cavity by means of trans-nasal balloon sinus dilation. These devices combine multiple functions in a hand-held, single, easy-to-use, cost-effective and minimally invasive device designed for efficient balloon sinus dilation procedures in the physician office or operating room. Our XprESS devices combine the features of balloon sinus dilation, suction, irrigation and light confirmation into a single-use device shaped to feel like a sinus seeker, a tool used regularly by ENT physicians to probe for sinus openings and drainage pathways. Our XprESS Pro device is compatible with the Fiagon IGS and enables tracking of the tip of the XprESS device allowing for additional confirmation of device placement.

Our XprESS devices include an ergonomic handle attached to a hollow metal shaft with a malleable tip that can be quickly shaped with our disposable bending tool and easily steered into diseased frontal, sphenoid and maxillary sinuses without requiring a guidewire or purchase of another component. Along the shaft of the tip are marks at 1.0 and 2.0 centimeters to denote depth of insertion into the sinus cavities. A balloon is attached to a movable shaft that allows the balloon to be advanced and retracted along the metal shaft. This enables the balloon to be kept out of the way while the device is being placed into a sinus opening, allowing the ENT physician to better visualize and enter the diseased sinus drainage pathway. The handle contains a one-finger balloon slide mechanism that is used to position the balloon within the sinus ostia and an integrated finger suction vent that allows the ENT physician to control active suction in order to maintain good endoscopic visualization throughout the procedure. The proximal end of the handle contains two ports that connect to the balloon inflation lumen and the suction/irrigation lumen of the metal shaft. The port used for suction and irrigation tubing also can accommodate a connection of a light fiber for trans-illumination. The port for balloon inflation connects to a one-handed inflation syringe used to inflate the balloon to a controlled pressure of 12 atmospheres, or approximately 175 pounds per square inch.
 Our XprESS Ultra device is our fourth generation balloon sinus dilation device. In addition to the features of our XprESS Pro and LoProfile devices, this device offers the lowest profile re-shapeable atraumatic ball tip balloon device in the industry. The tip of this device measures 1.5 millimeters, compared to 2.0 millimeters for our XprESS Pro and 1.75 millimeters for our XprESS LoProfile devices, allowing for better access to tight spaces within the sinus cavities.
 LED Light Fiber and Light Fiber
 The LED Light Fiber is a single-use tool that provides real-time high intensity red trans-illumination of the sinus cavity with its own battery power, eliminating the need for extra light sources, cables and adapters. This sinus confirmation tool consists of a flexible illumination fiber that emits light from the distal tip. The instrument snaps easily onto the proximal end of the XprESS device. A reduced diameter LED light fiber was developed and is currently packaged and sold with our XprESS Ultra and LoProfile products.
 Our Light Fiber is a single-use tool that also provides real-time trans-illumination of the sinus cavity. The fiber is designed to be loaded into the XprESS device and can connect to various different cables and light sources. When the light fiber is connected to the XprESS device, it allows for suction or irrigation to be performed through that XprESS device.

XprESS multi-sinus dilation device with LED Light Fiber
 FocESS Sinuscopes and FocESS Wireless HD Camera
 Our FocESS Sinuscopes provide ENT physicians with an easy-to-use solution for endoscopic visualization during a sinus procedure. The scopes are 3.0 millimeters in diameter, which we believe makes them suited for use in tight and inflamed nasal anatomy. These high definition scopes come in three viewing angles; zero-degree, 30-degree and 45-degree to enable physicians’ unique views during sinus procedures.
 Our FocESS Wireless HD Camera, which was sold to a limited number of customers in the fourth quarter of 2016 and released to the full market in the first quarter of 2017, provides high quality HD images on which physicians can rely without the hassle of additional cords and light sources. The combination of easy to integrate wireless technology without compromising on image quality makes the wireless camera unique in the ENT space. 
 MiniFESS Diagnostic Tools
 Our MiniFESS tools are designed to provide ENT physicians with an easy way to confirm sinus location and XprESS device placement. The intent of these tools is to enable users to screen symptomatic patients for in-office balloon sinus dilation and to more 
 8


easily and efficiently perform balloon sinus dilation procedures in the physician office and operating room. In addition, ENT physicians may use other competing devices to confirm sinus location and placement of XprESS devices.
 Our diagnostic MiniFESS tools comprise our Light Seeker, Maxillary Seeker and Sphenoid Seeker/Freer. The Light Seeker is a tool with optical fibers embedded into the device intended to allow ENT physicians to access the frontal sinus and trans-illuminate the sinus cavity and forehead to confirm correct entry into the frontal sinus. The Light Seeker is used to confirm non-surgical access to the frontal sinus prior to opening our XprESS balloon kit. The Maxillary Seeker is a tool designed to allow users to quickly find the correct angle to access the natural maxillary ostia. The Sphenoid Seeker/Freer is a two-in-one tool that is designed to enable ENT physicians to navigate easier access to the sphenoid ostium and to manipulate the middle turbinate. These stainless steel tools are reusable and can be used prior to balloon sinus dilation or as general sinus surgery tools.

MiniFESS tools and XeroGel Nasal Packing Material
 MiniFESS Surgical Instruments
 Our MiniFESS family of surgical instruments includes eight devices designed to enable physicians to perform several traditional surgical procedures with ease and confidence. These devices include a turbinate forceps, two Blakesley thru-cutters, a 2.5 millimeter Takahashi forceps, a sickle knife and Blakesley forceps in zero-degree, 45-degree and 90-degree orientations, respectively. Each device is designed to be used in specific sinus procedures, which enables them to be utilized easily in the office setting on appropriate patients. In addition, our Turbinate forceps product enables physicians to create greater space in tight anatomy through the controlled and precise compression of an enlarged middle turbinate, which we believe can make sinus procedures easier for physicians to perform.
 Our MiniFESS family’s Shaver System, released to a limited market in the fourth quarter of 2016 and to the full market in the first quarter of 2017, offers advanced technology in a compact size and is designed to be easy to use and provide high performance and reliability. With a combination of both disposable and reusable blades, we believe our shaver system offers physicians the flexibility they need to perform complex office procedures in a cost-efficient manner.
 Our Cyclone Sinonasal Suction/Irrigation System is designed to provide simultaneous suction and irrigation for easy, comfortable saline lavage. In a recent survey over 40% of physicians say they regularly irrigate their sinusitis patients. Irrigation is a common practice but one that physicians may avoid due to patient discomfort. By simultaneously irrigating and suctioning the related effluent, our Cyclone Sinonasal Suction/Irrigation System is intended to minimize patient discomfort. This product was released to a limited market in the third quarter of 2016 and to the full market in the fourth quarter of 2016.
 Fiagon Image Guidance System
 The Fiagon IGS consists of a navigation unit, navigation sensor, software instruments and a patient localizer. The system is designed to be integrated into any endoscopy tower. We believe the easy-to-use interface, compa
ct size and flexibility and ability of the Fiagon system to track tools from multiple manufacturers are 
advantages over traditional image guidance systems 
that 
require much larger physical footprints. Further, the Fiagon IGS has the capability to track our XprESS Pro device, which should provide physicians an added layer of confidence in device placement when desired. We believe the Fiagon IGS will help in the adoption of our products in treating more complex anatomical structures. In addition, the Fiagon IGS offers several additional disposable products including trackable suction and sinus-seeker like devices.
 We are the exclusive distributor of the Fiagon IGS and related ancillary products to ENT physicians in physician offices, clinics and surgery centers, located in the United States, certain U.S. territories and Canada, subject to certain exceptions for third parties that distributed the Fiagon products, at the time we entered into the original five-year distribution agreement in August 2015. In June 2016, we expanded our agreement with Fiagon to include sales to hospital customers, including the sale of Fiagon’s Premium Navigation System allowing more advanced ENT and cranio-maxillofacial applications. We are also the exclusive distributor of Fiagon GuideWires attached to or sold with our balloon products to hospitals in the United States, certain U.S. territories and Canada. Under 
 9


the terms of our distribution agreement, Fiagon has agreed not to collaborate with or support our competitors or any company intending to develop or commercialize products that are competitive with the Fiagon products we distribute or our balloon products in the United States, certain U.S. territories and Canada during the term of the agreement.
 XeroGel Nasal Packing Material
 Our XeroGel Nasal Packing Material is indicated for use in patients undergoing nasal or sinus surgery as a space-occupying packing to separate tissue or structures compromised by surgical trauma, prevent adhesions between mucosal surfaces, help control bleeding following surgery or trauma, and act as an aid in the natural healing process. XeroGel nasal packing material is also indicated for use to treat epistaxis, or nasal bleeding. XeroGel nasal packing material is a dissolvable co-polymer that contains chitosan, a naturally occurring element from chitin, or the exoskeleton of crustaceans. The co-polymer absorbs fluids, swells to conform to the treatment site and dissolves gradually, typically by the first postoperative visit.
Other Products
 In addition to our internal product development efforts, we may leverage our direct U.S. sales force by licensing or acquiring other products that can be used by ENT physicians for the treatment of sinusitis and related diseases.
Clinical Results and Studies 
 Overview
 We have developed a significant body of clinical data supporting the safety and effectiveness of our balloon sinus dilation products. We have sponsored one meta-analysis and eight clinical studies in which a total of 696 patients were treated with our products and followed to assess safety, and 538 patients were followed for an extended period of six to 24 months to assess long-term efficacy. Over 50 different clinical investigators participated in these clinical studies. Our clinical evidence includes the only published meta-analysis of patient-level data for stand-alone balloon dilation and the only published randomized trial with sufficient statistical power to demonstrate advantages of a nonsurgical treatment compared to traditional FESS for the treatment of chronic sinusitis. While we are aware of a limited number of studies comparing balloon dilation to FESS, these studies were small single-center studies that were under-powered, meaning their sample sizes were too small to prove their endpoints with sufficient statistical power. In contrast, the sample size for the REMODEL trial was calculated with sufficient statistical power (90%) at a one-sided alpha level of 0.025 to prove the two primary endpoints and hypotheses. The minimum required sample size was 72 patients (36 in each arm) and the trial exceed this requirement, with 130 patients completing 12-month follow-up. Our REMODEL prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial demonstrated that when our balloon sinus dilation products were used as a stand-alone therapy performed in the ENT physician office, patients experienced better recovery outcomes and similar efficacy to FESS. Throughout all our clinical studies, symptom reduction was shown in a broad set of clearly defined patient groups, including those presenting with chronic sinusitis, mild to moderate septal deviations, multi-sinus disease including disease in all eight sinuses or sinusitis present in any combination of the sinuses, and accessory ostia, which are multiple drainage pathways from the maxillary sinus. We also completed two additional studies in which our products were studied in cadaver specimens. The first cadaver study demonstrated effective and accurate trans-nasal entrance through the maxillary ostia with our XprESS device. The second cadaver study demonstrated that access to frontal sinuses using our XprESS device with trans-illumination is as effective as placement of a probe with a CT image guidance system. Finally, we are currently conducting a clinical study to treat Eustachian tube dysfunction with our XprESS device. Outcomes data and information on recent key studies is described below.
 Our clinical study data showed clinically meaningful and persistent levels of symptom reduction at one, three, six, 12 and 24 months. A study published in 2010 demonstrated that symptom improvements measured with QOL surveys after treatment with FESS do not appear to change between six and 20 months and recommended that clinical trial designs incorporating QOL outcomes following FESS should consider the six-month time frame as an appropriate long-term primary endpoint. Therefore, we believe that six-month follow-up is sufficient to assess long-term outcomes of our products. All but two of our eight clinical studies followed patients for at least 12 months.
 Meta-analysis of Stand-alone Balloon Sinus Dilation Studies
 A meta-analysis of stand-alone balloon sinus dilation studies was completed on patient-level data from six of our studies to evaluate long-term outcomes in a large patient sample and compare them with the outcomes from the REMODEL FESS cohort. The studies included the REMODEL randomized controlled trial balloon dilation arm and five prospective, multicenter, single-arm studies: XprESS Multi-Sinus, XprESS Maxillary Pilot, RELIEF, FinESS Registry, and BREATHE. Data were compiled from 358 patients with 846 treated sinuses. There were no statistically significant differences across studies for the demographics and baseline characteristics.
 Along with the final REMODEL results
, the met
a-analysis was published online on July 31, 2015, ahead of print publication in The Laryngoscope. It was subsequently published in the printed version in the January 2016 issue of The Laryngoscope.

The meta-analysis demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in mean SNOT-20 overall scores at all follow-up time points. For the 310 patients who received 12 month follow-up and the 74 patients who received 24 month follow up, the average decrease from baseline in the SNOT-20 score was 1.5 and 1.8, respectively. The results of the random effects model on the overall and subscale SNOT-20 scores are shown in the figure below. The changes in SNOT-20 scores were statistically significant, clinically meaningful, and durable through 24 months. A further analysis of variance comparison demonstrated no statistically significant differences between the SNOT-20 results from the FESS arm of the REMODEL trial, the balloon arm of the REMODEL trial and the five pooled single arm studies. 
Meta-analysis Random Effect Model of Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-20) Overall and Subscale Scores after Balloon Sinus Dilation

The meta-analysis results of the RSI scores indicated statistically significant improvements from baseline in both healthcare utilization and work/social measures. Using the Work Limitations Questionnaire work productivity was demonstrated to improve significantly in four of the five domains (time management, mental/interpersonal, outcome and productivity loss) for employed patients for up to two years after balloon sinus dilation. The meta-analysis was published online on July 31, 2015 along with the final REMODEL results in The Laryngoscope.

 REMODEL Randomized Trial of Entellus Balloon Sinus Dilation versus FESS
 We sponsored the REMODEL trial, which was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, in which 135 adult patients at 14 centers in the United States were treated between December 2011 and February 2013. The trial was designed to test the hypothesis that symptom improvement after balloon sinus dilation with our products in an ENT physician office was noninferior to FESS and that balloon sinus dilation with our products was superior to FESS for postoperative debridements. No study center contributed more than 20% of patient enrollments and results were consistent across sites. Patients were randomized one-to-one to either balloon sinus dilation or FESS.
 11


The two primary endpoints in the REMODEL trial were long-term improvement in sinus symptoms as assessed by the mean change in overall SNOT-20 QOL survey score between treatment and 12-month follow-up and the mean number of debridements per patient following treatment. Secondary and additional endpoints included the complication rate, recovery time, surgical revision rate, ostial patency, change in number of sinusitis episodes, and changes in activity impairment and work productivity. Post-procedure follow-up assessment of patients was performed at one week, and at months one, three, six and 12. A minimum of 36 patients were needed in each study arm to assess the primary endpoints with sufficient statistical power.
 After randomization, 135 of 151 enrolled patients completed treatment. Fourteen patients randomized to FESS withdrew their consent for treatment. Eight of these patients indicated they were withdrawing because they did not want to undergo surgical treatment, one person indicated withdrawal because the person’s primary physician recommended not undergoing FESS, three indicated they were withdrawing due to other non-sinus medical conditions or a lack of time available for follow-up and two were found to have exclusion criteria upon further review. Two patients indicated they were withdrawing from the balloon sinus dilation arm of the study, with one of them doing so because they did not want to undergo the balloon procedure. Six-month follow-up was achieved in 133, or 98.5%, of the 135 patients who completed treatment. Twelve-month follow-up was achieved in 130, or 96.3% of the patients. Additionally, each of the 66 eligible patients completed 18-month follow-up and each of the 25 eligible patients completed 24-month follow-up. Patients in this trial had suffered with chronic sinusitis symptoms for an average of over 11 years and had not undergone a previous sinus surgery or balloon dilation procedure before study enrollment. The mean SNOT-20 score prior to treatment in the REMODEL study was 2.5 in each arm of the study.
 Both primary endpoints were achieved in this trial. Comparison of changes between each trial group confirmed the mean symptom improvement for patients undergoing balloon sinus dilation was noninferior to that of patients undergoing FESS. Both trial groups experienced clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in overall SNOT-20 QOL survey scores. The mean number of postoperative debridements per patient showed a significant difference between the trial groups, demonstrating the superiority of balloon sinus dilation where patients in this group received an average of 0.2 debridements compared to an average of 1.0 debridements per patient in the FESS group.
 12


The trial demonstrated that when our balloon sinus dilation devices were used as a stand-alone therapy in the physician office setting, patients experienced similar efficacy rates in terms of symptom improvement, ostial patency, reduction of sinusitis episodes, and very low surgical revision rates, with faster recovery times, less bleeding at discharge, less use of prescription pain medication, and fewer post-procedure debridements than patients receiving FESS. The results of the final, larger cohort of 135 patients with between one and two years of follow-up, were published online on July 31, 2015, ahead of print publication in The Laryngoscope. The following table summarizes the final outcomes from the larger REMODEL trial cohort:

XprESS Pediatric Study
 We sponsored the XprESS Pediatric Study, a prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized study, in which 50 pediatric patients ranging in age from two to 21 years were treated at four clinical centers in the United States from October 2014 to June 2015. The primary outcome measures were the procedural technical success rates and the complication rate through 3-month follow-up. Secondary outcome measures were changes in quality of life instruments and the revision surgery rate through 6-month follow-up. A total of 157 sinus dilations were attempted in 50 participants. All 157 dilation attempts were successfully completed for an overall XprESS technical success rate of 100%. No complications (0%) were reported. Significant improvement in sinus symptoms, as measured by the Sinus and Nasal Quality of Life Survey (SN-5), was seen between baseline and 6 months (4.6 vs 1.7, p<0.0001). A minimal clinically important difference threshold of 1.0 in the overall SN-5 score was achieved by 92% of the participants. FDA clearance for the expanded indication was received in November 2015. The expanded indication includes treatment of maxillary sinuses in patients two years and older, and treatment of the frontal and sphenoid sinuses in patients 12 years and older. We believe we are the only company to have received FDA clearance for balloon sinus dilation to treat the frontal and sphenoid sinuses in adolescents. The results of this study were published online on November 26, 2016, ahead of print publication in the International Forum for Allergy and Rhinology.
 Eustachian Tube Study 
 In 2016, we completed enrollment for Phase 2 of our clinical study to treat Eustachian tube dysfunction with our XprESS device. This study is limited to 70 patients and follows the completion of Phase 1 of the study, which included 10 patients.

Sales and Marketing and Physician Training
 We have focused our sales and marketing efforts on educating ENT physicians about the clinical value, ease-of-use, convenience and cost-effectiveness of office-based sinus dilation as both an alternative to FESS for uncomplicated patients, and for patients who repeatedly fail aggressive medical management and are progressing toward becoming a surgical candidate. We also sell our products to ENT physicians who perform balloon sinus dilation in a hospital outpatient operating room or surgery center.
 We maintain a direct sales organization in the United States, which as of December 31, 2016 consisted of 90 full quota-carrying representatives. We intend to continue to increase our presence outside the United States through expansion of our United Kingdom sales force and the addition of distributors. As of December 31, 2016, we had several distributors selling our products in over 10 countries.
 Sales in the United States accounted for approximately 95% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. Sales outside of the United States accounted for approximately 5% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. Prior to 2015, we did not sell any products outside of the United States.
 Our marketing group and clinically focused personnel support our sales personnel through the following initiatives:
  
• | Education of ENT physicians is performed using a variety of methods and custom training tools including head model training, observation of video-taped procedures, online visualization of live procedures, cadaver lab training and visits to peers who perform office-based balloon sinus dilation. Our products typically do not require extensive clinical training for most new physician customers. Approximately 15% of newly trained physicians opt to visit a peer for physician training, whereas, other new users are trained with our custom training tools by field trainers from our sales, clinical and research and development organizations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We educate patients about the benefits of our sinus dilation procedure. We utilize online patient education information, and find-a-doctor resource to help patients who are exploring sinusitis treatment options to be able to discuss treatment options with their physician.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We promote to physicians the advantages of our products and the clinical outcomes they enable for patients.

Reimbursement and Procedure Economics 
 When balloon sinus dilation is performed adjunctively with standard FESS as a hybrid procedure, existing FESS codes are used and insurance coverage is available for an estimated 88% of covered lives in the United States as of December 2016.
 Effective January 1, 2011, when balloon sinus dilation is performed as a stand-alone procedure, providers use CPT codes 31295, -96, and -97 for dilation of the maxillary, frontal, and sphenoid sinus ostia, respectively. When a stand-alone balloon procedure is performed in the physician office, the reimbursement associated with these CPT codes includes a non-facility practice expense component of payment intended to cover the cost of equipment, supplies, and overhead associated with these procedures performed in the physician office, including the cost of our devices. In addition, physicians receive additional value from the convenience and efficiency of treating patients in their office setting compared to treatments in a hospital or surgery center. We believe that this, along with excellent clinical outcomes, motivates many ENT physicians and practices to adopt our balloon sinus dilation products.
 As an example of cost savings to the healthcare system from office balloon sinus dilation procedures, the 2017 Medicare national average payment rate to a physician performing bilateral maxillary sinus dilation in the office and a nasal endoscopy exam one week later is $3,297. By comparison, treating the same patient with FESS, including ethmoidectomy in an ASC, and performing a debridement one week later costs Medicare $5,749, or 54% more, including ENT physician professional fees of $968. Treating that same patient with FESS, including ethmoidectomy in a hospital out-patient department with a debridement one week later costs Medicare, $5,749, or 74% more than balloon sinus dilation office treatment. When more complex cases are performed involving dilation of four or six sinuses, the level of savings to the healthcare system for office sinus dilation increases. Publication in November 2016 by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, the federal agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, of final 2017 payment rates for stand-alone balloon sinus dilation resulted in 2017 rates very similar to 2016 rates.
 
 
Sinuses Dilated | 2017 Medicare National Average Payment Rates
---------------------------+---------------------------------------------
 | Office Balloon Sinus Dilation | | FESS in Hospital | | | FESS in ASC | | % FESS costs more than office dilation: Hospital & ASC
Maxillary | $ | 3,297 | | $ | 5,749 | | $ | 5,066 | 74% & 54%
Maxillary+Frontal | $ | 4,902 | | $ | 6,527 | | $ | 7,552 | 33% & 54%
Maxillary+Frontal+Sphenoid | $ | 6,447 | | $ | 6,948 | | $ | 9,681 | 8% & 50% 

 
Note: National average payment rates include the total reimbursement made to physicians and facilities for the balloon sinus dilation or FESS procedure plus cost of post-FESS debridement or post-balloon sinus dilation nasal endoscopy. Ethmoidectomy is performed with all FESS procedures.
 14


Medicare issued a final rule on the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System, or OPPS, for 2017 which includes a reduction of payments for certain outpatient procedures performed in the hospital when FESS is performed on more than two sinuses. The result is to bundle payments for multi-sinus surgery regardless of the number of sinuses being treated. On average, we expect most hospitals will experience a reduction in CMS reimbursement depending on the number of sinuses being treated.
 As of December 2016, third-party payor insurance coverage for stand-alone balloon sinus dilation procedures is available for an estimated 230 million persons in the United States, which represents 80% of covered lives. Positive coverage decisions for stand-alone balloon sinus dilation performed in the physician office setting are in place with several third-party payors including Medicare, United Healthcare, Aetna, Cigna, Humana, Kaiser Permanente, TRICARE, Health Net and in certain states Medicaid and Blue Cross Blue Shield plans. Balloon sinus dilation has the support of the American Academy of Otolaryngology and the American Rhinological Society, both of which have written positive policy statements for balloon sinus treatment and participate in efforts to obtain coverage.
 In December 2016, NICE provided positive guidance for use of our XprESS Multi-Sinus Dilation System in the United Kingdom, recommending it for use in patients with uncomplicated chronic sinusitis who do not have severe nasal polyposis. In these patients, NICE has asserted that, in comparison with FESS, our XprESS Multi-Sinus Dilation System works as well, is associated with faster recovery times and can more often be performed under local anesthesia. The NICE guidance indicates that our XprESS Multi-Sinus Dilation System is cost saving compared to FESS based on device cost, length of FESS procedure and assuming the treatments are performed under local anesthetic, in an outpatient setting. NICE estimates that, by adopting our technology, the National Health Service in England may save up to £7.4 million per year by 2020. The NICE guidance is specific to the XprESS Multi-Sinus Dilation System and does not extend to any other balloon sinus dilation technology.
 With the benefit of cost savings from office-based balloon sinus dilation procedures, we believe the combination of clinical and cost advantages will lead to additional coverage as payors become more knowledgeable about the full body of clinical evidence. However, there can be no assurance that payors will continue to cover stand-alone balloon sinus dilation, or that additional payors will issue positive coverage policies for the procedure.
 Competition
 Our industry is highly competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by activities of industry participants. We compete with companies and products used to treat chronic sinusitis, including traditional FESS, medical therapies and other balloon sinus dilation products. Our balloon sinus dilation products compete with medical management by providing a procedure and treatment option that may be chosen to be performed by ENT physicians after fewer rounds of medical management than historically employed due to the minimally disruptive nature of balloon sinus dilation as compared to FESS. Our balloon sinus dilation products compete with FESS by providing a comparably effective in-office alternative for patients with uncomplicated sinusitis. Accordingly, our balloon sinus dilation products are increasingly positioned in the middle of the treatment continuum between medical management and FESS, drawing patients from medical management who might not have chosen any treatment beyond medical management due to the invasive nature of FESS, as well as patients who would have chosen FESS if not for our less invasive alternative. Our balloon sinus dilation products also compete with other companies selling balloon sinus dilation products to ENT physicians. Our MiniFESS and other products also compete with companies selling devices for use in balloon sinus dilation. Additionally, ENT physicians may use competing devices, instead of our MiniFESS or other products, to confirm sinus location and placement of our XprESS device.
 Many of the companies developing or marketing these competitive products are publicly traded or are divisions of publicly traded companies. These companies may enjoy several competitive advantages over us, including:
  
• | greater financial and human capital resources;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | significantly greater name recognition;
--+----------------------------------------


• | established relationships with ENT physicians, referring physicians, customers and third-party payors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer greater discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | more established sales, marketing and worldwide distribution networks.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Companies that sell balloon sinus dilation products include the Acclarent division of Johnson and Johnson Inc., the market leader in balloon sinus dilation products, as well as the Xomed division of Medtronic, plc, and the ArthroCare division of Smith & Nephew, plc. In addition, a small private company, SinuSys Corporation, sells a non-balloon sinus dilation system that uses osmotic self-expansion technology. Companies that provide tools and devices for FESS include the Xomed division of Medtronic, plc, the Gyrus ACMI division of Olympus and Stryker Corporation. Intersect ENT, Inc. sells a steroid-eluting biodegradable stent that is used following FESS or in patients who have previously undergone an FESS procedure and is not currently a competitor. However, Intersect ENT is currently developing products for office-based treatment of sinusitis, which if approved may be competitive with us in the future.

We believe our continued ability to compete favorably depends on:
  
• | successfully expanding our commercial operations;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | continuing to enjoy suitable reimbursement economics for our customers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | attracting and retaining skilled personnel;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | continuing to innovate and demonstrate the advantages of our existing and new products in clinical studies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our patent licensor successfully protecting their intellectual property in the U.S.; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | protecting our patents.
--+------------------------

Intellectual Property 
 We believe that the strength of our competitive position depends substantially upon our ability to obtain and enforce intellectual property rights protecting our technology. We apply for patents for new patentable technologies relevant to our business and utilize other forms of intellectual property protection to strategically protect our intellectual property. Periodically, we may review and attempt to acquire rights in third-party patents and applications that we deem strategically valuable.
Patents
 As of December 31, 2016, we owned at least 33 issued U.S. patents relating to the field of sinusitis treatment and had at least 19 pending patent applications for U.S. patents. As of December 31, 2016, at least 13 of those issued patents and 7 of our pending patent applications included claims directed towards the XprESS family of products and methods of using the XprESS products.
 Many of the issued patents that protect our commercial products and current product pipeline are derived from applications that were filed between 2006 and 2009. Since U.S. law provides for a 20-year patent term measured from the date of filing, those patent holdings will begin to expire starting in 2026, though a number of those patents enjoy patent term extensions granted by the U.S. Patent Office. While we have pursued and continue to pursue patent protection for our technologies, we may, from time to time, abandon certain patents and patent applications for business reasons.
 Trademarks
 Our trademark portfolio as of December 31, 2016 included the XPRESS, PATHASSIST, FINESS, ENTELLUS MEDICAL, LIGHT FIBER, LIGHT SEEKER, FOCESS, CYCLONE, XEROGEL and MINIFESS marks.
 Trade Secrets
 We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secret law to protect portions of our technology. Trade secrets, however, can be difficult to protect.
 We seek to protect our proprietary technology and manufacturing processes, in part, by confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees, under which they are bound to assign to us inventions that are made during the term of their employment and relate to our business, unless otherwise accepted. These agreements further prohibit our employees from using, disclosing, or bringing onto the premises any proprietary information belonging to a third-party. In addition, most of our consultants, scientific advisors and contractors are required to sign agreements under which they must assign to us any inventions that relate to our business. These agreements also prohibit these third-parties from incorporating into any inventions the proprietary rights of third-parties without informing us. It is our policy to require all employees to document potential inventions and other intellectual property in laboratory notebooks and to disclose inventions to patent counsel. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
 While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

License Agreement with Acclarent, Inc.
 In February 2011, we entered into a license agreement with Acclarent, Inc. in connection with the settlement of a then-ongoing litigation in which Acclarent alleged that our FinESS and XprESS products infringed certain claims of five of their patents, which allegations we denied. In October 2012, we agreed with Acclarent to amend certain terms of our license agreement, or, as amended, the Acclarent License. Pursuant to the Acclarent License, Acclarent granted us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license under certain patents held by Acclarent to manufacture, use and commercialize our currently marketed XprESS, PathAssist and FinESS products and certain future versions of those products, or, collectively, the Covered Products, in the field of the expansion of paranasal sinuses and sinus pathways.
 Under the Acclarent License, we made an initial up-front, lump-sum payment to Acclarent as a retroactive royalty payment. We are also required to pay Acclarent an ongoing royalty in the low double-digit percentages, on a country-by-country basis, on net sales of Covered Products. The Acclarent License will expire upon the expiration or abandonment of the last to expire of the patents licensed to us under the agreement. Acclarent has the right to terminate the agreement upon 60 days’ notice in the event of our uncured material breach.
 Manufacturing and Supply 
 We manufacture and assemble the majority of our products at our facility in Plymouth, Minnesota using components from external suppliers. XeroGel nasal packing material is manufactured at our leased facility in Hayward, California. We perform inspections of all components before use. Using these components, we assemble, inspect, test and package our products and, when appropriate, send them to a third-party sterilization vendor. After sterilization (when required), we perform additional inspections of the finished products, carton and label products internally and release the lot to inventory and then ship the finished product to customers. Certain other of our products are manufactured for us pursuant to distributor and other agreements, such as Fiagon IGS.
 We believe our manufacturing operations are in compliance with regulations mandated by the FDA. We are an FDA-registered medical device manufacturer. Our manufacturing facilities and processes are subject to periodic inspections and audits by various federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies. For example, our facilities were inspected by the FDA in May 2015, and no major nonconformance reports were issued as a result of that inspection. Our facility was last inspected in October 2016 by the British Standards Institute, our Notified Body, and no major nonconformance reports were issued as a result of that inspection.
 Certain components used in our products are supplied to us from single source suppliers. We rely on single-source suppliers for some of our balloon extrusions and molded components and some off-the-shelf components. We generally acquire our single-source components pursuant to purchase orders placed in the ordinary course of business. While our suppliers have generally met our demand for their products on a timely basis in the past, we are not certain that they will in the future be able to meet our demand for their products, either because of the nature of our agreements with those suppliers, our limited experience with those suppliers, or our relative importance as a customer to those suppliers.
 Our suppliers manufacture the components they produce for us or test our components and devices to our specifications. We intend to maintain sufficient supplies of the components from these single-source suppliers in the event that one or more of these suppliers were to encounter delay in supply or end supply to enable us to continue to manufacture our products for a sufficient amount of time necessary to obtain another source of components.
 Government Regulation 
 The design, development, research, manufacture, testing, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, sale and export and import of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies. Failure to obtain or maintain approval or clearance to market our products or to meet the ongoing requirements of these regulatory authorities could prevent us from marketing and continuing to market our products.
 Regulation by the FDA
 In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, FDA regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, device safety, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping procedures, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, recalls and field safety corrective actions, and post-market surveillance, including complaint handling and medical device reporting. The FDA regulates the design, manufacturing, servicing, sale and distribution of medical devices. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. The FDA can also refuse to approve or clear pending applications.
 17


Each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the United States requires marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution either through the 510(k) premarket notification process or the more demanding premarket approval, or PMA, process, unless an exemption applies. The type of marketing authorization necessary is generally linked to the classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II, or III) based on the degree of risk associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Low- and moderate-risk devices requiring fewer controls are placed in Class I or II. Class I devices that pose the least risk are subject only to the general controls applicable to all devices, such as requirements for device labeling, premarket notification and adherence to the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, as reflected in the Quality System Regulation, or QSR. Class II devices that pose a moderate risk are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries, or post-market surveillance. Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls, including devices that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury.
 Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement and can be marketed without prior authorization from the FDA. Some Class I devices that have not been so exempted and Class II devices are eligible for marketing through the 510(k) clearance pathway. By contrast, devices placed in Class III generally require PMA approval or 510(k) de novo classification prior to commercial marketing. The PMA approval process is more stringent, time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) clearance process; however, the 510(k) clearance process has also become increasingly stringent and expensive.
 Medical Devices. Each of our current commercially available devices is classified as either a Class I device exempt from the requirement to submit a 510(k) notification, or as a Class I or Class II device requiring 510(k) clearance. None of our current commercially available devices is classified as a Class III device requiring PMA approval.
 510(k) Clearance. To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device, commonly known as the “predicate device.” A legally marketed predicate device may include a device that was legally marketed in the United States prior to May 28, 1976 for which a PMA is not required (commonly known as a “pre-amendment device” based on the date the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted), a device which the FDA has reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device which has been found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics, or (ii) different technological characteristics, but the information provided in the 510(k) submission demonstrates that the device does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness and is at least as safe and effective as the predicate device. A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data.
 Before the FDA will accept a 510(k) submission for substantive review, the FDA will first assess whether the submission satisfies a minimum threshold of acceptability. If the FDA determines that the 510(k) submission is incomplete, the FDA will issue a “Refuse to Accept” letter which generally outlines the information the FDA believes is necessary to permit a substantive review and to reach a determination regarding substantial equivalence. An applicant must submit the requested information before the FDA will proceed with additional review of the submission. Once the 510(k) submission is accepted for review, by regulation, the FDA has 90 days to review and issue a determination. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. Unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees.
 Medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved. After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval and payment of an FDA user fee. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
 PMA Approval. A PMA must be submitted to the FDA if the device is classified in Class III or otherwise cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process (although the FDA has discretion to continue to allow certain pre-amendment Class III devices to use the 510(k) process). PMA applications must be supported by, among other things, valid scientific evidence demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of the device, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data. A PMA application must also include, among other things, a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling. FDA regulations provide 180 days for the FDA to review a PMA application and make a determination, although the process typically takes significantly longer, and may require several years to complete. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant or its 
 18


third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
 None of our products are currently approved pursuant to a PMA, and we have no plans for any indication or system improvement or extension that we believe would require a PMA.
 Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials are generally required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. Such trials generally require submission of an investigational device exemption, or IDE, application to the FDA for a specified number of patients and study sites, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. If an IDE is required, the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, at the clinical sites must approve the study before clinical trials may begin. Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, record keeping and reporting requirements. Clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an IRB for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to those relating to good clinical practices. To conduct a clinical trial, the patient’s informed consent must be obtained in form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. The clinical trial sponsor, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance or approval to market the product.
 In September 2016, following an inspection of certain documentation relating to our prospective, multicenter study of children with chronic rhinosinusitis treated with the XprESS™ Multi-Sinus Dilation System, the FDA issued a Form 483, List of Inspectional Observations, containing two observations. The first observation relates to not obtaining FDA and IRB approval for changes to an investigational plan and the second observation relates to not ensuring prompt compliance with the study protocol by clinical investigators. These observations relate to study deviations which occurred when some physicians decided to treat sinuses outside of the scope of the study protocol due to medical necessity thereby avoiding the need for a follow-on procedure. Following our receipt of the Form 483, we implemented and completed corrective and preventive actions we believe fully address the FDA observations, and we provided written responses to the FDA detailing these corrective and preventive actions completed. The outcome of this matter is presently uncertain, and we cannot provide assurance that the FDA will conclude that our corrective and preventive actions are adequate to address the observations. If the FDA is not satisfied, they may issue a warning letter to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Continuing FDA Regulation
 Any devices we manufacture or distribute pursuant to 510(k) clearance or PMA approval by the FDA are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. These include product listing and establishment registration requirements, which help facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory actions. We are required to adhere to applicable cGMP requirements, as set forth in the QSR, which require, manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process. Noncompliance with these regulations can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, FDA refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approval to new devices, withdrawal of existing clearances or approvals, and criminal prosecution.
 We must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting, or MDR, requirements which require that we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, and any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as “off-label” promotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution.
 Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including delays in or failures to report incidents to the FDA as required under the MDR regulations or off-label promotion, can result in enforcement action by the FDA which can include any of the following sanctions:
  
• | warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, administrative detention or seizure of our products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new or modified products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 19


 
• | withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal to grant export approval for products; or
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

 We cannot guarantee that we have adequately complied with all regulatory requirements. If any of these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 European Union’s Regulation of Medical Devices
 The European Union has adopted legislation, in the form of directives to be implemented in each Member State, concerning the regulation of medical devices within the European Union. The directives include, among others, the Medical Device Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC) that establishes certain requirements, i.e. the essential requirements, with which medical devices must comply before they can be commercialized in the EEA (which is comprised of the Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland). Under the European Union Medical Device Directive, medical devices are classified into four Classes, I, IIa, IIb and III, with Class I being the lowest risk and Class III being the highest risk. Under the Medical Device Directive, a competent authority is nominated by the government of each Member State to monitor and ensure compliance with the Directive. To demonstrate compliance of their medical devices with the essential requirements, manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for certain types of low-risk medical devices (Class I non‑sterile, non‑measuring devices), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the Medical Devices Directive, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of an organization accredited by a Member State of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments, which is referred to as a Notified Body. The Notified Body would typically audit and examine the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the medical devices before issuing a certification demonstrating compliance with the essential requirements. Medical devices that comply with the essential requirements are entitled to bear the CE mark. CE is an abbreviation for Conformité Européene, or European Conformity. Medical devices properly bearing the CE mark may be commercially distributed throughout the EEA. Additional pre-market approvals in individual EEA countries are sometimes required prior to marketing of a product. Failure to maintain the CE mark would preclude us from selling our products in the EEA, as could failure to comply with the specific requirements of the Member States.
 In September 2012, the European Commission published proposals for the revision of the EU regulatory framework for medical devices. The proposals would replace the Medical Devices Directive with a new regulation, or the Medical Devices Regulation.. Unlike the Directives that must be implemented into national laws, the Medical Devices Regulation would be directly applicable in all EEA Member States and so is intended to eliminate current national differences in regulation of medical devices. In October 2013, the European Parliament approved a package of reforms to the European Commission's proposals. Under the revised proposals, only designated “special notified bodies” would be entitled to conduct conformity assessments of high-risk devices. These special notified bodies will need to notify the European Commission when they receive an application for a conformity assessment for a new high-risk device. The European Commission will then forward the notification and the accompanying documents on the device to the Medical Devices Coordination Group, a new, yet to be created body chaired by the European Commission and consisting of representatives of Member States, for an opinion. 
 In June 2016, the Council of the European Union’s Permanent Representatives Committee endorsed the agreement reached with the European Parliament on the proposed Medial Devices Regulation. It is expected that the final regulation will be largely unchanged from the proposed regulation.  Formal publication of the regulation in the Official Journal of the European Union and entry into force is expected in May 2017, followed by a three year transition period. The regulation incorporates a product life-cycle approach similar to the one used by FDA, which follows a device from conceptualization all the way through end of life. In general, this will include stronger premarket and post-market surveillance requirements and require manufacturers to continually evaluate products they have placed on the market. Additional changes include stricter oversight and requirements for notified bodies, additional requirements for clinical evidence, strengthened rules for high-risk devices, and increased transparency and traceability for the medical device industry as a whole. These new rules and procedures may result in increased regulatory oversight of certain devices and this may, in turn, increase the costs, time and requirements that need to be met in order to maintain or place such devices on the EEA market.
 Further, the advertising and promotion of our products in the EEA is subject to the laws of individual EEA Member States implementing the EU Medical Devices Directive, Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other EEA Member State laws governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals. In the EEA, our European operations must comply with the EU Medical Device Vigilance System, the purpose of which is to improve the protection of health and safety of patients, users and others by reducing the likelihood of reoccurrence of incidents related to the use of a medical device. Under this system, incidents must be reported to the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the EEA. An incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in labeling or instructions that may, 
 20


directly or indirectly, lead or have led to death or serious health deterioration of a patient. Incidents are evaluated by the EEA Competent Authorities to whom they have been reported, and where appropriate, information is disseminated between them in the form of National Competent Authority Reports, or NCARs. The Medical Device Vigilance System is further intended to facilitate a direct, early and harmonized implementation of Field Safety Corrective Actions, or FSCAs, across the Member States of the EEA where the device is in use. An FSCA is an action taken by a manufacturer to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers and/or to the end users of the device through Field Safety Notices.
 U.S. Anti-Kickback, False Claims and Other Healthcare Laws
 We are also subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the U.S. federal government and the states as well as foreign governments and other authorities in the locations in which we conduct our business. These other agencies include, without limitation, CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, as well as state and local governments. Such agencies enforce a variety of laws including, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, data privacy and security, and physician transparency laws and regulations.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. Among other things, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between medical device manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers and purchasers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, these exceptions and safe harbors are technical in nature and narrowly drawn. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances with prosecutorial discretion. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. In addition, committing a violation does not require a person or entity has actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate. Further, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute also could constitute a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
 The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to or approval by the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of medical device companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition, the federal civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, contains federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation.
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs.
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, 
 21


and their respective implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as service providers of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also contains four tiers of civil monetary penalties and gives state attorneys general authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from HIPAA and each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect.
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education and Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, imposes, among other things, annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers of devices for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures.” Covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. In addition, certain states require implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance with the device industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices, and/or tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.
 These laws impact the kinds of financial arrangements we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers of our products. They particularly impact how we structure our sales offerings, including discount and rebate practices, customer support, education and training programs, physician consulting, research grants and other arrangements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Our currently cleared products are treated as supplies utilized in balloon sinus dilation procedures and if covered by third-party payors, are typically paid for as part of a stand-alone balloon sinus dilation procedure or as a part of FESS if used in conjunction with FESS. Failure by physicians, hospitals, ASCs and other users of our products to obtain sufficient coverage and reimbursement from healthcare payors for procedures in which our products are used, or adverse changes in government and private third-party payors’ coverage policies would have a material adverse effect on our business.
 In the United States, third-party payors continue to implement initiatives that restrict the use of certain technologies to those that meet certain clinical evidentiary requirements. We are aware of a number of third-party payors in the United States, including without limitation Anthem/Wellpoint and certain Blue Cross Blue Shield plans that consider stand-alone balloon sinus dilation procedures to be experimental or investigational. Failure to obtain and maintain favorable coverage policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. In the international markets reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country. Market acceptance of our products is dependent upon the different types of healthcare payment systems including government-sponsored healthcare, private insurance and self-paid.
 In addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies, there are periodic changes to reimbursement. Third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes, among other things, annual updates to payments to physicians, hospitals and ASCs for procedures during which our products are used. Because the cost of our products generally is recovered by the healthcare provider as part of the payment for performing a procedure and not separately reimbursed, these updates could directly impact the demand for our products. An example of payment updates is the Medicare program’s updates to hospital and physician payments, which are done on an annual basis using a prescribed statutory formula. In the past, when the application of the formula result
ed in lower physician payments, Congress has passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions. However, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, ended the use of the statutory formula, and provided for a 0.5% annual increase in payment rates under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule through 2019 but no annual update from 2020 through 2025. MACRA also introduced a merit-based incentive bonus program for Medicare physicians beginning in 2019. At this time it is unclear how the introduction of the merit based incentive program will impact overall physician reimbursement under the Medicare program. Any changes in coverage and reimbursement that further restrict coverage of our products or lower reimbursement for procedures using our devices could materially affect our business.
 22


Healthcare Reform
 Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage for the procedures associated with the use of our products, or result in lower reimbursement for those procedures. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products.
 By way of example, the Affordable Care Act substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices, provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, the excise tax has been suspended from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017, and, absent further legislative action, will be reinstated starting January 1, 2018.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fisca
l year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals.
 We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
 Research and Development
 Realizing that new product offerings are relevant to our future success, we are committed to a strong research and development program. Our research and development efforts are focused primarily on enhancing our XprESS family of products and broadening their indications for use, as well as developing new related products. Our research and development program consists primarily of engineering, product development and clinical studies to develop and support our current products, products and technologies in development and next generation versions of current products. Our internal research and development team works closely with external research and development consultants and a network of physicians and medical personnel to ensure we have broad access to best-in-class ideas and technologies to drive our product development pipeline. We also have an active business development team that actively evaluates technologies and products. In addition, our clinical and regulatory departments are devoted to verifying the safety and efficacy of our products according to regulatory standards enforced by the FDA and other international regulatory bodies. Our research and development expenses totaled $7.8 million, $5.4 million and $4.3 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 280 employees. We have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations are good.
Financial Information
 We operate in one reportable segment, which we have presented as the aggregation of our sinusitis product families. Within this reportable segment we are organized on the basis of the products and services we provide which are used for the treatment of chronic and recurrent sinusitis. See Note B—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Segment, Geographical and Customer Concentration and Note N—Segment and Geographic Data of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information regarding segment reporting and our revenue and long-lived assets by geographic region.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and, for so long as we are an emerging growth company, are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These include, but are not limited to:

• | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We may remain an “emerging growth company” until as late as December 31, 2020, the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, or IPO, though we may cease to be an “emerging growth company” earlier under certain circumstances, including if (1) we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenue in any fiscal year, (2) the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 or (3) we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of such extended transition period. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that we can elect to opt out of the extended transition period at any time, which election is irrevocable.
