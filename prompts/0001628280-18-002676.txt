ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview

Telaria, Inc. (formerly Tremor Video, Inc.) is a software company providing a fully programmatic, self-service, seller platform to monetize and manage premium video content across all internet-connected screens and devices. 
We automate the sales process for publishers of premium video content by allowing them to efficiently identify, package and deliver their advertising inventory to advertisers, agencies and other buyers, while protecting the integrity of their brand and the consumer viewing experience. Our seller platform connects publishers to buyers via direct integrations with leading third-party demand-side platforms, or DSPs. This allows publishers to efficiently monetize their advertising inventory however they want to transact, whether through open auctions or private marketplaces. Private marketplaces can be transacted through invite only auctions, where select buyers are given the opportunity to bid on a curated set of inventory, or through direct connections that allow publishers to programmatically transact with a specific buyer. Integrations with DSPs are done through server-to-server connections and, as a result, we are able to significantly reduce latency and response time for our clients’ ad campaigns. 
Our technology provides publishers with the real-time control and insights they require to optimize and automate their video advertising sales and manage their inventory across sales channels, devices and platforms. Our seller platform was built specifically for digital video and to support the unique requirements of mobile, over-the-top, or OTT, and connected TV, or CTV, platforms. We enable publishers to exercise complete control over their monetization strategy by defining supply hierarchies and demand tiers, minimum price floors, and advertiser and category-level black and white lists to manage potential sales channel conflicts. We offer publishers a full suite of tools to ensure the integrity of their brand and the consumer viewing experience, including the ability to review and block specific ad creative units, manage ad frequency, and control for factors such as the volume of an ad. Our seller platform provides publishers with up-to-the-second reporting, which allows them to effectively monitor buying patterns and make real-time changes to take advantage of market dynamics and extensive analytics that leverage billions of historical data points to drive long term monetization strategy. We also offer innovative diagnostic capabilities and transparency to our publishers so that they have a complete picture of how their inventory is represented in the marketplace. This allows publishers to immediately identify and act to resolve any issues impacting revenue generation. In addition, DSPs that connect through our seller platform have access to real-time bidding data, insights and analytics enabling them to more effectively manage buying. 
We have built long-standing relationships with premium video publishers, and we believe the scale and quality of our client base makes us an important partner to video ad buyers. We provide our platform to publishers outside the United States through our international operations in Europe, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific regions. Buyers on our seller platform include some of the largest brand advertisers in the world and our platform is integrated with the leading video volume buyers in digital advertising. 

We generate revenue each time a transaction occurs on our platform based on a simple and transparent fee structure established with our publisher partners. We do not purchase and re-sell inventory from publishers and do not collect any fees directly from buyers. We act as an agent on behalf of publishers and revenue is recognized, net of any inventory costs that we remit to publishers, when a buyer purchases inventory from a publisher on our platform. 
Historically, we operated a buyer platform business in addition to offering our seller platform. The buyer platform enabled advertisers, agencies and other buyers of advertising to discover, buy, optimize and measure the effectiveness of their video ad campaigns across digital screens. We recently made the strategic decision to focus our business exclusively on offering our seller platform, and on August 7, 2017, we announced that we had completed the sale of our buyer platform to an affiliate of Taptica International Ltd. for total consideration of $50 million in cash, subject to adjustment for working capital. Following the sale, we no longer provide a buyer platform solution. As a result, we are able to fully concentrate our resources on expanding our seller platform, while avoiding the inherent conflicts of interest that exist when serving both buy and sell-side clients. 
On September 11, 2017, we changed our name from “Tremor Video, Inc.” to “Telaria, Inc.” In connection with the name change, our NYSE ticker symbol was changed to “TLRA” and our corporate website address was changed to www.telaria.com. Information on or accessible through our website is not incorporated by reference to this report.

Our Industry
Online video is among the fastest growing advertising formats worldwide. Several factors, including the availability of high-speed broadband and mobile network infrastructure, penetration of internet-connected devices, a proliferation of online content publishers and a behavioral shift towards online and non-linear video viewing, are driving robust growth in online video consumption. 
Consumers are rapidly shifting their viewing habits towards digital mediums and expect to be able to consume content seamlessly across multiple devices, including computers, tablets, smartphones, and CTVs. The rapid adoption of OTT viewing and CTV has disrupted the traditional linear TV distribution model, creating new options for consumers and new economic opportunities for content publishers and advertisers.
The continued growth of online video consumption is resulting in a corresponding increase in the amount of advertising dollars being spent by brands through digital video channels. According to estimates from eMarketer, the global online video advertising market is expected to grow from $17.1 billion in 2016 to $42 billion in 2020, representing a compound annual growth rate of 25%. Online video advertising provides a number of advantages over traditional television advertising for both publishers and buyers. For publishers, digital advertising enables content owners to realize the greatest value of their video content by providing tools to maximize advertising yield and manage inventory allocation, while providing advanced real-time reporting and analytics that can inform the sales process. For buyers, online video advertising combines the rich “sight, sound and motion” of television with the advanced optimization, targeting and analytics of digital. 
As online video advertising continues to scale and evolve, the need for software solutions that automate the process for planning, buying, selling and measuring video advertising across screens has become more pronounced. As a result, the amount of online video advertising being bought and sold programmatically has increased. Programmatic buying refers to the automated purchase and sale of digital advertising through technology, including the use of real-time bidding technology that allows for the dynamic purchase and sale of advertising inventory on an impression-by-impression basis. We believe that programmatic buying will continue to grow as a percentage of video advertising spend. A report from eMarketer estimates that programmatic digital video ad spending will represent 74% of total U.S. digital video ad spending by the end of 2018.
Despite the tremendous growth opportunity in the online video advertising market, publishers of video advertising face a number of challenges that require sophisticated technology to solve. Publishers face a complex advertising landscape with an increasing number of buyers and technology intermediaries and multiple channels for content consumption for consumers. Furthermore, for content providers to increase their audience, they must focus on the high expectations those audiences have for the end user experience. For instance, publishers must ensure that ads load properly and do not cause delays, are brand safe, match the quality of the premium content that is being viewed, are played at the appropriate volume, and are not overly repetitive. Publishers also need tools to ensure proper management of sales channel and advertiser conflicts. All of these requirements must be executed in real-time and at scale, across multiple channels and devices, while continuously monitoring and controlling their inventory to maximize yield. 
Our Platform
Our software platform features:

• | Yield optimization. Our seller platform is integrated with the leading video volume buyers in digital advertising, creating a robust marketplace through which publishers are able to efficiently monetize their advertising inventory through multiple channels and transaction types, including open auction, private auction and private direct. We provide tools that enable publishers to define supply hierarchies and demand tiers, minimum price floors, and advertiser and category level black and white lists to manage potential sales channel conflicts and ensure that our seller platform complements their direct selling efforts. 


• | Advanced brand safety controls. We provide publishers with essential tools and controls to ensure the integrity of their brand and the consumer viewing experience. For instance, our creative review tool lets publishers review the specific creative ad unit that is being served to their inventory, including the volume of the ad relative to their content. If the creative ad unit does not align with the publisher’s brand parameters or content guidelines, they can easily block the ad from serving. We recently introduced an ad-pod feature, which provides long-form video publishers with a tool analogous to commercial breaks in traditional linear television, so that they can request several ads at once. Using this tool, publishers can establish business rules within the ad-pod to increase their value, such as competitive separation of advertisers within an ad-pod and the ability to filter out repetitive ads.

• | Real time reporting, analytics and diagnostics. Our platform provides publishers with access to up-to-the-second reporting, which allows them to effectively monitor buying patterns and make real-time changes to take advantage of market dynamics and maximize their yield. We also provide access to extensive analytics that leverage billions of historical data points derived through our platform to drive long-term monetization strategy for publishers. Our real-time diagnostic tools enable publishers to discover and resolve any revenue impacting issues within seconds. 

Our Competitive Strengths

• | Built exclusively for video. Our seller platform is focused exclusively on managing and monetizing digital video inventory. Unlike other platforms that were originally built to monetize display advertising, our platform was built from day one to address the special requirements of online video, in particular applications running on mobile or CTV devices. Online video poses a number of unique challenges compared to display such as the ability to dynamically inserts ads into live streams, control for ad volume, ensure ad formats play across devices and best match the viewer’s environment, and accommodate spikes in video consumption around landmark events. Any failure to address these challenges could significantly impair the user experience, which is of utmost importance to premium publishers. 


• | Fully agnostic platform for publishers. We are fully aligned with the interests of our publisher partners. Because we do not offer a buyer solution, we are able to avoid inherent conflicts of interest that exist when serving both the buy- and sell-side. In addition, because we do not own or publish content we are agnostic and have no preference towards delivering demand to any specific publisher. As a result, we are able to build trust with clients, many of whom incorporate their proprietary data into our platform. This trust provides us the benefit of long-term and stable relationships with our clients. 


• | Scalability and continuous innovation. Our seller platform is built with a flexible architecture and an adaptable data pipeline at its center, so that we can easily expand the platform as well as integrate with ecosystem partners, enabling our clients to use our platform as a full-suite solution to serve all of their needs. Our open architecture allows us to implement rapid product cycles so that we are continuously innovating to enhance our platform for our clients and stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly evolving industry. For example, we believe that we were the first sell-side solution to deliver programmatic ads into live streaming content and first in market with features optimized for CTV inventory. 


• | Self-service model. We offer a self-service model that lets publishers direct their own sale and management of video ad inventory without extensive involvement by our personnel. This model allows us to scale efficiently and grow our business at a faster pace than the growth of our sales and support organization. As a result, we are able to achieve a high degree of operating leverage, which positions our business for growing profitability. 


• | Transparent pricing. We generate revenue each time a transaction occurs on our platform based on a simple and transparent fee structure established with our publisher partners. We do not purchase and re-sell inventory from publishers and do not collect any fees directly from buyers. This allows publishers to get a true measure of the value of their inventory. 


• | Premium unique inventory. We believe the scale and quality of our client base makes us an important partner to video ad buyers. We have expanded significant time and resources cultivating and building long-term relationships with premium content providers that offer a high-quality TV-like production and viewing experience, in particular in the OTT and CTV space. This inventory is highly sought after by advertisers looking to capitalize on the shift in video consumption from linear TV to digital. 

Clients and Sales
As of December 31, 2017, we had total sales and marketing staff of 89 employees. For 2017, 2016 and 2015 our total sales and marketing expenses were $28.1 million, $22.3 million and $13.8 million, respectively.
Our sales strategy is focused on serving the following core client constituencies: publishers that use our seller platform to manage and monetize their video inventory and buyers that transact on our seller platform, including DSPs that directly purchase inventory on behalf of their clients as well as brand advertiser and advertising agencies who ultimately control and direct advertising spend through DSPs.

Our publisher sales team is responsible for increasing the number of premium content providers using our seller platform as well as the amount of ad inventory being monetized through our platform. Our buyer sales team is responsible for increasing the amount of spend and bidding activity being transacted by buyers on our platform. 
Publishers
Publishers own or operate websites and applications through which video advertisements can be delivered to consumers as they navigate across screens. Publishers use our seller platform as a yield-optimization and supply management tool to improve their selling efforts.
We are focused on establishing direct relationships with premium content providers that offer high- quality production and viewing experiences, in particular in the OTT and CTV space. This inventory is highly sought after by advertisers looking to capitalize on the shift from linear TV to digital, as it combines a TV-like viewing experience with the significant advantages of online advertising, including the ability to target engaged viewers that have actively opted-into the content. 
Our publisher focused sales initiatives use a full-service development and support strategy. Sales executives and account managers are assigned to specific publishers to ensure that they are receiving the maximum benefits offered by our seller platform, and are supported by engineers with deep technical expertise. 
We have invested significant resources in identifying and cultivating relationships with publishers to ensure they understand the potential benefits of using our seller platform. Because we seek to build long term direct relationships with premium content providers, the sales process can be time consuming and resource intensive. 
Buyers
DSPs are technological intermediaries through which advertisers and agencies transact on our seller platform. DSPs provide ad delivery and related technology solutions for advertisers and agencies and purchase video inventory on behalf of those advertisers and agencies. These DSPs are directly connected to our technology through server-to-server integrations and are responsible for bidding on and purchasing advertising inventory on our seller platform pursuant to a master service agreement. 
We maintain close relationships with DSPs to maximize the amount of spend being transacted through our platform. For instance, our sales team collaborates with DSPs to create custom private marketplaces that fit specific targeting criteria for inventory being sought by the DSP. Our team of technical account managers continually monitors DSP bidding activities and provides recommendations that inform their trading practices, including insights around bidding behaviors and forecasting tools that assist in media planning. 
While each DSP is responsible for bidding decisions, the overall direction of an advertising campaign is typically determined by the advertiser or advertising agency that has engaged the DSP. Accordingly, in order to increase the amount of spend transacted on our seller platform, we also maintain close relationships directly with brand advertisers and agencies. Our brand-focused sales strategy is to target most “video ready” brand advertisers, including large traditional TV advertising spenders, who are looking to capitalize on the shift in video consumption from linear-TV to online. Our agency sales team is focused on establishing relationships with key decision makers within the largest advertising agencies and agency trading desks. 
Technology and Development
We have incurred substantial technology and development expenses developing, maintaining and improving the technology that underlies our seller platform. We believe that technology innovation is key to our success and we intend to continue to invest in the development of new feature sets and functionalities as well as enhancements to our existing product suite. As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 20 employees engaged in technology and development functions. The majority of our technology and development team is located in Mountain View, California. For 2017, 2016, and 2015, our total technology and development expenses were $8.6 million, $7.0 million and $4.8 million, respectively.
Competition
We operate in a dynamic and competitive market, influenced by trends in both the overall advertising market as well as the online video advertising industry. The competitive dynamics of our market are unpredictable because our market is in an early stage of development, rapidly evolving, fragmented and subject to potential disruption by new technological innovations. We compete with large internet and media companies such as Alphabet, Inc., Facebook, Inc. and Comcast, Inc. that offer video 
7

advertising services and sell video advertising inventory as part of a larger solution, as well as advertising technology companies, advertising networks, and supply side platforms that represent publishers. Publishers that use our seller platform may also use other technology partners to sell their inventory or may sell a significant portion of their inventory through their own sales organizations without use of our seller platform. Many of our competitors have significant client relationships, much larger financial resources and longer operating histories than we have.
We believe that we compete on the basis of our ability to technologically innovate, the speed, reliability, scale and ease of use of our self-service platform, our ability to bring demand to publishers at scale, the quality of tools that we provide to publishers to manage their inventory and our real-time reporting and analytics. We believe that we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors. Other competitive strengths include our video-only focus, first mover advantage in OTT and CTV, independent business model that allows us to fully align with our publisher partners, and our emphasis on transparency in pricing and inventory quality. 
Intellectual Property
Our ability to protect our intellectual property and our technology will be an important factor in the success and continued growth of our business. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property and protect our proprietary technology. We register certain domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. We also rely upon common law protection for certain marks. We generally enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with parties, with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. We also use measures designed to control access to our technology and proprietary information. We view our trade secrets and know-how as a significant component of our intellectual property assets, which we believe differentiate us from our competitors.
Our efforts to preserve and protect our intellectual property, may not prevent the misappropriation of such intellectual property or technology, or deter independent development of similar intellectual property or technology by others. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property is difficult. Third-parties may attempt to copy, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain our proprietary technology, or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. Unauthorized disclosure by our employees, contractors or other third-parties could also occur. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other jurisdictions in which we operate and the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any impairment or loss of our intellectual property, or any inability to enforce our intellectual property rights effectively, could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our technology and intellectual property is costly and time-consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property or technology could make it more expensive for us to do business and could harm our operating results.
Additionally, we expect that products in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement lawsuits as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. From time to time, we may face claims by third-parties that we infringe upon or misappropriate their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon or to have misappropriated such rights. We cannot assure you that we are not infringing on or violating any third-party intellectual property rights. 
Governmental Regulation; Industry Alliances
We are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that are applicable to companies engaged in the online video advertising business. In addition, many areas of law that apply to our business are still evolving, and could potentially affect our business to the extent they restrict our business practices or impose a greater risk of liability. We are aware of several ongoing lawsuits filed against companies in our industry alleging various violations of privacy or data security related laws.
Privacy and Data Protection
We are subject to or affected by federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as regulatory guidance, governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention, and security of personal data, such as the use of personal data for online analytics, use of online tracking technologies, or collection or precise geo-location of mobile devices. The global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Changes to these laws, regulations and guidelines may affect our ability to collect, use, and share personal data, and to provide services to customers that rely upon our ability to leverage data. The use of personal data for online and digital advertising is a topic of active interest among federal, state, and foreign regulatory bodies. Proposed legislation, regulations and guidelines could, if enacted or implemented, prohibit or limit our ability to use certain technologies that track individuals’ 
8

activities on web pages, in emails or on the Internet. We also participate in industry self-regulatory programs that set standards for privacy and security of personal data, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS, or standards governing online advertising, or mobile carriers’ rules governing interactions with mobile devices that operate on the carriers’ networks. We may be required by comply with these standards by our partners, vendors, or clients. Evolving global privacy and data protection requirements may create uncertainty in our business, result in liability or impose additional costs on us. As a result of any continuing legislative initiatives and customer demands, we may have to modify our operations to enable us to continue to leverage personal data and other content. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state, or foreign laws or self-regulatory standards could result in negative publicity, diversion of management time and effort and proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising. Additionally, if we fail to follow the commitments we make in public privacy notices or applicable self-regulatory security standards, such as those set forth in the PCI DSS, even if no customer information is compromised, we may incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in costs
Our solutions reach devices and users throughout the world, including in Australia, North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Our operations abroad may also be subject to increased scrutiny or attention from data protection authorities. Many countries in these regions have established or are in the process of establishing privacy and data security legal frameworks with which we, our customers, or our vendors must comply. For example, the EU has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which is scheduled to go into effect in May 2018 and introduces strict requirements for processing personal data. The GDPR is likely to increase compliance burden on us, including by mandating potentially burdensome documentation requirements, granting certain rights to individuals to control how we collect, use, disclose, retain and leverage information about them. In addition, the GDPR provides for breach reporting requirements, more robust regulatory enforcement and fines of up to 20 million euros or up to 4% of annual global revenue. As we continue to expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business.
Information security risks have generally increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the Internet, and the increased sophistication and activity of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties, some of which may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Any person who circumvents our security measures could steal proprietary or confidential customer information or cause interruptions in our operations. Numerous state, federal and foreign laws and regulations impose requirements regarding the security and protection of personal data, as well as notification to persons whose personal data is affected by a breach. Breaches we may experience could significantly harm our reputation and business and financial results. 
Industry Alliances
Given the developmental stage of video advertising, industry practices are rapidly evolving. We participate in a wide range of Interactive Advertising Bureau committees, councils and working groups, as well as other industry groups that are focused on establishing best practices for the online video advertising industry.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 136 employees, of which 20 were primarily engaged in technology and development functions, 89 were engaged in sales and marketing functions, and 27 were engaged in general and administrative functions. Substantially all of these employees are located in the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be favorable.
Facilities
        Our principal office occupies approximately 26,000 square feet of leased office space in New York, New York pursuant to a lease agreement that expires in 2029. We also lease offices in San Francisco, California; Santa Monica, California; Mountain View, California; London, England; Sydney, Australia; Melbourne, Australia; New Zealand; Malaysia; and Singapore. We believe our facilities are adequate for our current and near-term needs.
