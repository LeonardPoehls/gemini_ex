 Business Overview
  
  Versar, Inc. is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1969. We are a global project management company providing value-oriented solutions to government and commercial clients in three business segments: (1) Engineering and Construction Management (ECM); (2) Environmental Services Group (ESG); and (3) Professional Services Group (PSG). We also provide tailored and secure engineering solutions in extreme environments and offer specialized abilities in construction management, security system integration, performance-based remediation, and hazardous materials mangement.
  
  Fiscal 2016 proved to be an eventful year for Versar. The year began with the successful completion of the strategic acquisition of a federal security integration business from Johnson Controls, formerly known as Johnson Controls Security Systems, which is now known as Versar Security Systems (VSS). VSS is a security systems integrator that designs, installs and supports complex physical security, network security, and facilities management systems primarily for Federal Government clients such as Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Department of Justice (DOJ), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The acquisition of VSS expanded Versar’s client base, technical capabilities, and geographic scope.
  
  As the year progressed, Versar faced significant challenges as revised government procedures and other market factors resulted in longer timelines for contract awards and project start dates than the Company anticipated. This resulting impact on the Company’s financial performance created constraints that initiated covenant defaults with our lender and a related inability to file our required securities filings in a timely manner, resulting in additional oversight from the lender and the Company’s related contracting of a Chief Restructuring Officer (CRO) and exploration of financial and strategic alternatives. The Company operated at a financial loss for fiscal 2016. In response, the Company initiated a wide range of deliberate cost cutting measures during fiscal 2016, the results of which will continue to be realized in future periods. We will continue to manage our costs based on financial performance. As we adapted internally to longer cycles in both contract award and project start dates, we experienced a decrease in our backlog as compared to fiscal 2015. To address this, we adjusted our bidding strategies and teaming partnerships, diversified our capabilities, and made strategic hires. As a service-based company, our revenue is primarily derived from the provision of labor-based services, rather than capital-intensive product offerings. Thus, our revenue is driven by our ability to retain existing clients, attract new clients, provide quality project and program management at competitive rates, and identify and retain qualified employees.

Approximately 11% of our fiscal 2016 revenue was generated in international locations.
  
  Our consolidated gross revenue for fiscal 2015 was $159.9 million, of which approximately $154.8 million was funded with U.S. currency and approximately $5.1 million was derived from PPS, and funded in Pounds sterling. Approximately 18% of our fiscal 2015 revenue was generated in international locations.
  
  Our consolidated gross revenue for fiscal 2014 was $110.3 million, of which approximately $107.6 million was funded with U.S. currency and approximately $2.7 million of the remainder was derived from PPS, and funded in Pounds sterling. Approximately 30% of our fiscal 2014 business was conducted in international locations.
  
  Our Strategy
  
  In addressing fiscal 2016’s challenges, Versar remains committed to our customers, shareholders, employees and partners. Versar will continue to provide technical expertise to our primarily federal customers. We will focus on international construction management in austere environments, security solutions, ongoing investments in military base efficiencies and renovation, compliance and environmental remediation. To reiterate our long-term strategy to reflect our new reality, the following elements are driving our strategy:
  
    1.
  Re-Establish Financial Stability and Grow Shareholder Value. In the near term, Versar will become current with our financial reporting requirements with the NYSE MKT LLC (the Exchange) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While we continue to seek a long-term financial solution, we are exploring all strategic options. We are committed to conservatively managing our resources to ensure shareholder value and re-establish our financial stability.

    2.
  Profitably execute current backlog. Our front-line project managers and employees will continue to control costs and streamline processes to profitably execute our current backlog. In addition, our back-office staff will redouble efforts to support our front-line employees efficiently and effectively serve our customers. We are committed to innovatively transform our business processes to be as efficient and cost-effective as possible.

    3.
  Grow our pipeline. We are aggressively mining existing Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicles to increase win rates. While we reduced back-office staff in our Business Development division, we remain committed to growing our pipeline and backlog by carefully managing our proposal efforts from identification through award to maximize our business development investments.

    4.
  Retain and attract the best people. Our employees are critical to the execution of our strategy and we are committed to attracting and retaining the employees required to achieve all the elements of our strategy.

 
  Competition
  
  Government Contracting is a highly competitive industry, where price is often the deciding factor. In that environment, it is critical for Versar to differentiate our capabilities and offerings to ensure that our customers understand the value of our offerings. Versar carefully targets our business development and sales efforts and has developed strategic partnerships to enhance our competitive advantage.
  
  The acquisition of VSS in fiscal 2016 expanded our customer base to include the FAA and FEMA, among others, as well as increased our service offerings into higher margin classified construction. During fiscal 2017, we will position the company to expand these new capabilities to existing customers and existing capabilities to new customers.
  
  Backlog
  
  We report “funded” backlog, which represents orders for goods and services for which we have received firm contractual commitments. Based on its history, the Company believes that approximately 90% of funded backlog will be performed in the succeeding twelve to eighteen-month period following the execution of the relevant contract. However, there can be no assurance that we will ultimately realize our full backlog. Additionally, other companies with similar types of contracts may not calculate backlog in the same manner we do, as their calculations may be based on different subjective factors or because they use a different methodology. Therefore, information presented by us regarding funded backlog may not necessarily be comparable to similar presentations by others.
  
   

  
 
  As of July 1, 2016, funded backlog was approximately $136 million, a decrease of approximately 24% compared to approximately $179 million of funded backlog at the end of the fiscal year 2015. Backlog for the DAFB project at the end of fiscal 2015 was $55.1 million compared to $8.6 million at the end of fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2016, the DAFB revenue recognized was $50.2 million as compared to $43.2 million in fiscal 2015. The Company’s funded backlog value at fiscal 2015 was the largest in the Company’s history primarily driven by the August 13, 2014 award of DAFB contract of $98.3 million.
  

 
  Employees
  
  At July 1, 2016, we had 529 employees, of which 75% are engineers, scientists, and other professionals. 58% of our professional employees have a bachelor’s degree, 38% have a master’s degree, and 4% have a doctorate degree as their highest level of education earned.
