ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We were incorporated on June 23, 2015 in the state of Nevada. Our principal executive office is located at Room 7C, World Trust Tower Building, 50 Gloucester Road, Hong Kong. Our principal telephone number is + (852) 3610-2665.
 
We intend to offer planting and cultivation services to land owners in regards to the planting and cultivation of Aquilaria Subintegra & Aquilaria Sinensis trees. We also intend to provide services relating to the extraction of Agarwood from such trees through a process known as “inoculation.”
 
We believe we will be able to generate revenue from providing such services by charging a fee. We will determine at a later date an appropriate fee to charge, depending on the the particular service or services that we will provide.
 
If our revenues should grow to the point it is financially feasible to do so we also intend to purchase or rent our own plot of land so that we too can plant and cultivate such trees, and subsequently extract the Agarwood from them, of which we can then resell to consumers and distributors.
 
Description of Business
 
Bosy Holdings Corp. currently has four employees including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Operating Officer (COO). Our COO, Mr. Ong has substantial experience with, and knowledge of, Agarwood plantation management and inoculation skills, and is responsible for training new employees and overseeing anticipated expansion plans of hiring new employees in the future. Our Officers and Directors each have the flexibility to work on our business up to 25 to 30 hours per week, but are prepared to devote more time if necessary. Our CEO and COO are working as farmers utilizing special inoculation technology (Fungi Tech. and Fertilizers) and cultivation methods.
 
Below are a few photographs from our orchard depicting the ongoing maintenance required to upkeep the Acquilaria trees. Additionally, we have provided a graphic depicting how the infection of the tree takes place (which is necessary to develop the Agarwood that we plan to ultimately harvest). The pink bottle is filled with an infectious fungus.
 

Description of Inoculation 
 
Fungal inoculation is an important step in the process of harvesting agarwood and we briefly describe how fungal inoculation works, as it pertains to agarwood, below. First, about 1-10 cm deep holes are drilled up to the xylem of agarwood trees in specified spots and their trunks are injured. Holes are dug in such a manner that there is enough space for air circulation. Though the size of the holes is immaterial, care should be taken to see that the injury spreads and the holes don’t get covered.
 
Pipes made out of Plastic or Natural material can be inserted into these holes to ensure that they remain open. On an average, about 40 – 90 holes are drilled on one tree trunk, at a distance of 5 cm from one another. Once the spread of injury is ascertained, fungi should be released into the tree trunk, forcing the tree to start resin production. Either the fungi collected from old agarwood trees are collected and released into experimental plants or processed difco yeast, sodium bisulfite, ferric chloride, etc., are introduced in place of natural fungi.
 
Depending on their breed, agarwood can be obtained from 3 – 80-year-old-trees by the process of fungal inoculation. However, trees can start yielding agarwood 18 – 21 months after the infection has begun. It should additionally be noted that there are many other factors which play a major role in determining the yield of the plant.

Proposed Business Plan 
 
We, Bosy Holdings Corp., are a developmental stage company that intends to offer planting and cultivation services to land owners in regards to the planting and cultivation of Aquilaria Subintegra & Aquilaria Sinensis trees. We also intend to provide services relating to the extraction of Agarwood from such trees, through the process of “fungal inoculation.”
 
Initially, we plan to target land owners seeking our services in Malaysia.
 
Note: “Plantation management services,” and “management services” are synonymous herein, with “planting and cultivation services.” “Landlord” is synonymous herein with “land owner.”
 
With the process of fungal inoculation explained previously this is how our business operations will be conducted going forward: We, Bosy Holdings Corp., will provide any and all planting, cultivating, and or inoculation services requested by a landlord who already has an existing plot of land to grow Aquilaria Subintegra & Aquilaria Sinensis trees.
 
After consulting with the landlord in regards to the services they request from us, a fee will be agreed upon amongst us and the landlord. After coming to an agreement with the landlord on a fee for our services we will, within one week, provide the landlord a list of all the materials necessary to carry out the requested services. The landlord, not us will bear the costs of any materials and will maintain ownership of such materials after our services are no longer necessary. On a case by case basis we will determine whether or not the landlord will pay us to acquire such materials or if they will acquire the materials and then provide them to us. Of course this will be at the landlord’s discretion. Any materials for any project will be held at the property of the landlord and we will not be responsible for their safekeeping. Our own employees however, will have some of their own general supplies and equipment provided to them by us, including but not limited to, gloves, hoes, shovels, tiller rake, and spades.
 
A few examples of some of the kinds of materials we may be in need of depending on the scope of our services from landlords include: Saplings, fertilizer, soil, manure, sand, irrigation rigs, poly bags, fencing, and commercial farming machinery.

While many of the landowners may request our services to begin the process of planting new Aquilaria trees we believe many others will already have an existing orchard that is ready or close to ready for harvesting of Agarwood, at which time we can offer our inoculation services or services relating to the general maintenance of the trees. It should be noted that the scope of our services will be conducted on a case by case basis depending on the landlord’s request. We will however, be prepared to oversee any part of the process of caring for or cultivating the Acquilaria tree, regardless of what point in time it is currently in with respect to its lifespan. Of course we will also be prepared to complete the inoculation process as well in which we would extract the Agarwood from the trees themselves.
 
Other Company Plans
 
In addition to our services that we intend to provide landlords, we also desire to seek out a plot of land that we could either rent, or purchase to grow our own orchard of Acquilaria trees of which we could then harvest the Agarwood from and sell to consumers or distributors. It should be noted however, that this is not part of our immediate plan of operations, unless it should be financial feasible to do so. Any proceeds from this offering we intend to allot directly to our service related businesses, not this endeavor. We will only begin considering the above at such time that we have generated enough revenues that we feel we could finance this project through those revenues. At this time, we have not yet identified a property for rent or purchase. Our budget for the aforementioned will be determined at a later date.
Marketing Efforts
 
Currently, we are developing a corporate website which we feel will bolster our presence in the market space. On the site we intend to list some of the services we intend to offer and pictures of our employees at work once we develop a client base.
 
We will also be pursuing marketing campaigns by utilizing the internet, social media, and perhaps even print media. These plans have not yet been determined in sufficient detail to outline herein.
 
Timeline to Initiate Operations
 
As mentioned in Form S-1, we have begun the development of our corporate website and will expect to complete in mid-2017. We will begin purchasing the basic necessities in mid-2017. We feel our employees should have at their disposal, regardless of the particular services we have been contracted for. Examples of these items are listed in our above business plan. As we begin purchasing these items, we will simultaneously begin seeking experienced employees (about five employees) who have worked in agriculture, preferably with Acquilaria trees. We believe that by end of 2017, we will be prepared to begin offering our services to landowners and that we will have a suitable work force to provide such services.
 
*We feel that the funds we intend to raise in this offering will be sufficient to cover our planned operations herein.
