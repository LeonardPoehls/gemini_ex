Item 1. | Business
----------------------------------+---------

 
Protea is an emerging growth bioanalytics technology company that provides analytical and diagnostic solutions for the rapid and direct identification, mapping and display of the molecules present in living cells and biological samples. Protea is applying it’s technology to the development of a new generation of products and services that enable more rapid and comprehensive analysis of living cells and biofluids, thereby providing data that helps to define normal biological and disease processes. Protea’s technologies enable the discovery and analysis of the proteins, metabolites and other biomolecules that regulate the biological functions of the human body and all other forms of life.
 
We believe that our technology provides useful bioanalytical capabilities that provides analytical and diagnostic solutions targeted towards the pharmaceutical, agricultural and life science industries that facilitate the rapid and direct identification, mapping and display of the molecules present in living cells and tissue samples. In addition, our technology supports the bioanalytical needs of immuno-oncology, the emerging frontier of cancer treatment that utilizes the body’s own immune system to fight diseases. We also apply our technology to develop new diagnostic tests to improve the differential diagnosis and management of cancer.
 
“Bioanalytics” refers to the identification and characterization of the molecules that are produced by living cells (known as “endogenous molecules”) and molecules that are introduced into cells (exogenous molecules), such as new pharmaceuticals.
 
Our Technology and Services 
 
Cancer Diagnostic Assay Development – 
 
Using our proprietary bioanalytics technology, we are able to qualify and validate new molecular assays for the differential diagnosis of certain cancers.
 
To support our diagnostics development, we developed a proprietary software suite known as “Histology Guided Mass Spec Imaging (HG-MSI).” The software enables pathologists to combine traditional microscopy and histology with high resolution mass spectrometry molecular imaging, allowing researchers to share, annotate and direct the analysis of specific tissue morphologies and cell subpopulations by mass spec imaging. With HG-MSI, molecular profiling data are collected from discrete locations within a tissue section using a histology stained section as a guide. The digital tissue scans are visually analyzed by pathologists, who annotate specific areas for further analysis. The annotated areas are then targeted by mass spectrometry to acquire a chemical fingerprint of the representative area. This chemical information can then be used to identify specific molecules of interest and map the biomolecules present in a visualized morphology. This workflow is applicable to all classes of biomolecules (e.g., proteins, peptides, lipids, metabolites) and can be carried out on both fresh frozen and formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens.
Melanoma diagnosis - Yale Collaboration
 
We established a collaborative research initiative with The Yale University School of Medicine that employs our technology to differentiate benign melanocytic nevi from malignant melanoma, by identifying unique protein expression profiles within the cells. In April 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement for technology with Yale University related to the differential diagnosis of melanoma, specifically designated as a "Method of Differentiating Benign Melanocytic Nevi from Malignant Melanoma." The technology was co-invented by Dr. Rossitza Lazova, and Dr. Erin Seeley, our Principal Investigator.
According to research report, “Cancer Statistics, 2015 (Siegel RL, Miller KD, Jemal A. CA Cancer J Clin. 2015;65(1):5–29.)”, in 2015, an estimated 73,870 persons were diagnosed with melanoma in the United States. The increase in melanoma diagnosis is partially attributed to the increase in skin biopsies, which have increased 2.5 fold from 1986-2001 (BMJ 7515, 331- 481, 2005, “Skin Biopsy Rates and Incidence of Melanoma: Population Based Ecological Study”.) We believe more accurate, sensitive and unbiased testing is needed to analyze samples where the diagnosis is initially indeterminate.

Lung cancer diagnosis - MSKCC Collaboration
 
We have established a collaborative research agreement with the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), to apply our technology to improve the analysis of early stage lung adenocarcinoma. The objectives of the collaboration are to demonstrate that different cancer cell sub-groups within a lung cancer will have different molecular profiles and will respond to treatment differently. The goal is to define these molecular differences and to identify the sub-group of cancer cells with the worst prognosis that are most likely to recur, thereby enabling earlier treatment intervention, and to use these findings to achieve lung adenocarcinoma tumor cell “molecular profiling,” leading to more precise treatment selection and higher survivor rates.
 
Bioanalytical Technologies
 
We develop new proprietary bioanalytical technology through internal research and by entering into collaborations with leading medical research institutions and companies where we apply our capacities and infrastructure to generate new molecular discoveries and technologies that we believe will be important assets for our growth and development.
 
LAESI bioanalytical technology platform
 
LAESI technology was invented in the laboratory of Professor Akos Vertes, Ph.D., Dept. of Chemistry, The George Washington University (GWU), and exclusively-licensed to Protea. This technology enables the direct identification of proteins, lipids and metabolites in tissues, cells and biofluids such as serum and urine. Data is available in seconds to minutes, allowing rapid time to results and the capacity to analyze thousands of samples in a single work period. As an example, a researcher testing a new drug’s effects on living cells can analyze changes in the cells’ metabolism across a specific time course, thereby almost immediately obtaining data as to the activity of the new drug.
 
LAESI employs a proprietary (patented) method that utilizes the water content in a sample (native or applied) to transition the sample into a gas state, where it can be analyzed by a mass spectrometer. LAESI accomplishes this without requiring the sample to be touched. By eliminating sample preparation, the biological sample can be analyzed without the possible contamination, bias or sample loss that occurs with current techniques, which require the introduction of chemicals, or the destruction of the sample itself, in order to enable analysis by mass spectrometry.
 
We successfully completed the development of prototype instrumentation of LAESI technology, which integrates with laboratory instruments known as mass spectrometers. The Company believes that LAESI technology has the potential to significantly improve the availability of molecular information in pharmaceutical research as well as many other fields including agriculture, pathology, biomarker discovery, biodefense and forensics.
 Advantages of LAESI technology 
 
We believe that our proprietary LAESI technology, combined with other bioanalytics technology developed by Protea, provides us with certain competitive advances over existing technologies and which we believe will become a new industry standard. Some of these are discussed below:
 

· | Eliminates Traditional Analytical Drawbacks: The LAESI platform eliminates two of the major drawbacks of traditional mass spectrometry - sample preparation and loss of spatial information. LAESI can analyze a wide range of sample types with no sample preparation required. In addition, samples such as a tissue section or cells can be analyzed “as is,” even live cells and bacterial colonies. LAESI technology generates big data molecular profiles of tissue sections, biofluids (blood, urine and serum) and many other sample types, including horticulture specimens, cell lines & pellets, bacterial colonies, hair fibers, contact lenses and hydrogels.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enables Mass Spectrometry Imaging: Protea's LAESI technology directly analyzes biological samples without the need to apply chemicals or introduce tags or tracers. Proprietary software developed at the company enables two- and three-dimensional direct molecular imaging, displaying the distribution of molecules in biological samples.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Numerous Molecules per Analysis: It is not unusual to detect over 1,000 individual molecules in a single experiment. Larger databases aid the “molecular eyesight” of a researcher, improving their prospects to find new biomarkers or molecular data that will provide new research insight.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Minimal Sample Destruction: Because of the small spot size, the sample is only locally destroyed by the laser ablation pulse. With the use of positional stages, LAESI allows, the spatial localization of biomolecules within a sample, thereby enabling two- and three-dimensional direct molecular imaging.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | High Throughput Sample Profiling: The LAESI platform also functions as a high throughput processing system for well plate and bacterial colony analysis. With the ability to analyze samples in seconds, researchers are able to quickly screen libraries of compounds, strains, and other assays very rapidly.

Biotherapeutic protein characterization 
 
We have developed technology to improve the molecular characterization of biotherapeutics (also known as “therapeutic proteins” and “monoclonal antibodies”), in particular the ability to identify their structural elements that are critical to assuring the biotherapeutic’s functionality. Biotherapeutic researchers have the need to understand several things about the therapeutic protein including: the protein sequence, molecular weight, any post-translational modifications and host cell proteins. To assist with these needs, we are collaborating with a leading provider of analytical software to develop applications for biotherapeutic protein analysis. We have also developed “workflows” (or, optimized methods for an experimental process) for the use of our high-resolution instrumentation for the analysis of these samples.
 
Biotherapeutic Software development - collaboration with Protein Metrics
 
We have signed a renewal of its collaboration with California-based Protein Metrics Inc. for further applications development of their advanced analytical software for Protea’s bioanalytical services. We believe that by combining our high-resolution mass spectrometry molecular data with the analytical power of Protein Metrics software, we will develop bioinformatics tools that we can offer to facilitate the analysis of the structure of therapeutic proteins, including their disulfide linkages, glycoforms and other structural components.
 
Systems Biology bioanalytical technology - DARPA 
 
In January 2014, the Company, as a subcontractor to GWU, was awarded a multi-year project with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (“DARPA”). In addition to Protea, The Stanford Research Institute International and GE Global Research also collaborate on the project entitled, “New Tools for Comparative Systems Biology of Threat Agent Action Mechanisms.” A $15 million five-year project, the goal of DARPA’s Rapid Threat Assessment (“RTA”) program is to develop new methods to elucidate the mechanism of action of a threat agent, drug, biologic or chemical on living cells within 30 days from exposure. Uncovering the mechanism of action of such agents in 30 days, compared to the years currently required, could be key to the development of effective countermeasures. The molecular networks within living cells are vast and complex. Conventional approaches fail to capture the system-wide response of a living cell to a threat agent. We believe our participation in this project will result in new technology to accelerate the characterization of biological samples in rapid threat assessment scenarios.
 
Skin bioanalytical technology
 
We recently established an agreement with MatTek Corporation (“MatTek”), which allows Protea to include MatTek’s human cell based in vitro tissue models with Protea’s proprietary molecular imaging services. By combining the human tissue models with mass spectrometry imaging workflows, researchers will be able to visualize specific compounds in highly - controlled experimental conditions using human cell derived, in vitro models.
 
Proprietary Reagents and products
 
We developed proprietary bioanalytical reagents and products to facilitate sample preparation prior to mass spectrometry analysis. Our proprietary products include new surfactants, the Progenta ™ acid labile surfactants that feature novel, acid cleavable formulations that are sample sensitive and fully compatible with mass spectrometry analysis.
 
Bioanalytical Services
 
Our bioanalytical services enable the identification and characterization of both small molecules (e.g., lipids and metabolites) and large molecules (e.g. proteins). The Company believes that it is a commercial leader in the molecular characterization of biotherapeutics (also called “biopharmaceuticals”), and in providing multimodal mass spectrometry imaging services that provide both small and large molecule 2D and 3D molecular imaging capabilities. Our clients include pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnology companies, and academic and government laboratories.
 
We believe our proprietary bioanalytical services are unique, in that we can provide integrated proteomics, metabolomics, protein characterization and mass spec imaging solutions. We combine our next generation LAESI bioanalytics platform with MALDI (“matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization”), and LCMS (“liquid chromatography mass spectrometry”) to offer integrated service capabilities.

The Company’s “Mass Spec Imaging” (“MSI”) bioanalytical services represent a revolutionary capability that for the first time enables the identification of all classes of biologically-active molecules produced by cells, and combines this with the ability to instantly spatially-display the molecules (both two- and three-dimensional) in tissue histology sections. LAESI-MSI can be performed without sample preparation, labeling or antibody techniques, thereby integrating direct molecular identification with tissue pathology for the first time. Since the sample is not touched, data is unbiased and more rapidly available.
 
Our technology supports the bioanalytical needs of immuno-oncology, the emerging frontier of cancer treatment that utilizes the body’s own immune system to fight diseases. We provide both visual and analytical evaluation of therapeutic efficacy and apply the Company’s technology to the analysis of drug target tissues and tumor microenvironments. Our services include two main technologies: 1) multimodal mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) for the identification and characterization of biomolecules (from proteins to metabolites and small molecules) as a function of their location within tissues, and 2) liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) for the identification and characterization of proteins and metabolites from cells, tissues, blood/serum samples, and biopharmaceutical sources.
 
We believe that the synergy of these technologies combined with innovative method development provides for an unparalleled depth of biomolecule assessment for immune-oncology applications. Understanding the distribution of these therapeutics, derivatives, metabolites and other compounds affected by the compound can provide insight into the efficacy of the drug and overall molecular impact. Once target tissues are imaged, data analysis could include quantitation of the dosed therapeutic, distribution analysis, and other bioinformatics including statistical and pathway analysis. Combined with imaging, we also provide expert antibody characterization that can verify appropriate therapeutic design. Through our multimodal approaches, we can also monitor therapeutic production processes to guide optimization decisions at the metabolic level.

One large pharmaceutical company accounted for 22% of our gross revenue in 2016, and we anticipate that this customer will continue to be a significant contributor to revenue in 2017.
Industry and Market Overview
 
Bioanalytics Industry
 
The Global Bioanalytics Industry consists of the products and services that provide molecular information for the elucidation, identification and characterization of the biomolecules that are the products of all living cells (endogenous molecules) as well as the molecules that are manufactured and used as therapeutics (exogenous molecules), diagnostics and other analytical purposes for the Life Sciences Industries.
 
There are many methodologies that have been developed and are used by the Bioanalytics Industry. However, due to its ability to deliver both qualitative and quantitative characterization of biomolecules within a wide variety of sample types, it is our belief that the predominant technology platform is mass spectrometry. We believe that mass spectrometry is the gold standard within the Bioanalytics Industry.
 
Mass Spectrometry
 
Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique that ionizes chemical species and sorts the ions based on their “mass-to-charge ratio. It is a 100-year-old method that was originally used for radioisotope enrichment and chemical composition analysis. More recent developments in soft ionization techniques (e.g. electrospray and MALDI), drove advances in the use of mass spectrometry for the analysis of biomolecules, and have helped solidify biological mass spectrometry as the backbone of the Bioanalytics Industry. Mass spectrometers are used extensively in the biopharmaceutical, industrial, chemical, materials and forensics industries, as well as in academic research institutions.
 
According to a market research report, “Mass spectrometry Market by Platform (Hybrid mass spectrometry (Triple Quadrupole, QTOF, & FTMS), Single mass spectrometry (Quadrupole, TOF, & Ion trap)) & by Application (Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology) (Analysis & Global Forecast to 2020), mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a technique used to visualize the spatial distribution of chemical compositions (e.g. small molecules, biomarkers, metabolites, peptides or proteins) by their molecular masses. For biological samples, MSI enables researchers to map the presence of analyte signatures and overlay those onto optical images of the original sample, thereby allowing comparison of the structure and architecture of a sample with its chemical compositions. The global mass spectrometry market was valued at U.S. $4.9 billion in 2015 and is expected to reach US $7.3 billion by 2020, growing at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 8.1% from 2015 to 2020.
 
Bioanalytics Market 
 
The largest segment of the bioanalytics market is comprised of the pharmaceutical industry’s use of bioanalytics to support the development of new therapeutics. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (“PhRMA”), estimated a total of $49.58 billion in research and development expenditures in 2012. Of this, $11.82 billion was spent on prehuman/preclinical functions, which represented 23.8% of all R&D expenditures. This figure does not include non-PhRMA member companies, and R&D expenditures by government agencies such as the National Institute of Health (NIH) and National Institute of Cancer (NIC) or domestic and international biopharmaceutical companies that are not members of PhRMA.

According to a market research report, “Contract Research Organizations (CROs) Services Market by Type (Preclinical, Clinical Research, Laboratory), Therapeutic Area (Oncology, CNS, Cardiovascular), End User (Pharmaceutical, Biopharmaceutical & Medical Device Companies) (Global Forecast to 2021)”, the global Pharmaceutical services market is projected to reach USD 41.86 Billion by 2021 from USD 29.29 Billion in 2016, at a CAGR of 7.4% from 2016 to 2021. The market is expected to witness significant growth in the coming years due to the increased demand for outsourcing of analytical testing and clinical trial services majorly by pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, and medical device companies. The high-quality standards in the pharmaceutical industry, rapid growth in the biosimilars and biologics market (or biotherapeutics), rising demand for outsourcing services by pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, and increase in the number of clinical trial activities are factors driving the growth of this market.
According to a market research report, “Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs) Market Analysis By Source (Chimeric, Murine, Humanized, Human), By Type of Production, By Indication (Cancer, Autoimmune, Inflammatory, Infectious, Microbial, Viral Diseases), By End-use (Hospitals, Research, Academic Institutes, Clinics, Diagnostic Laboratories) And Segment” (Grand View Research, Forecasts, 2013 – 2024, November 2016, http://www.grandviewresearch.com), therapeutic proteins (known as “biopharmaceuticals”, “biotherapeutics” or “biologics”), represent a rapidly growing sector of the pharmaceutical industry. The global market for the largest biopharmaceutical component (“therapeutic antibodies”), was valued at USD 85.4 billion in 2015 and is expected to reach a value of USD 138.6 billion by 2024 with an annual growth rate of 5.7%. Rising incidence of cancer and other chronic diseases is serving as the key contributing factor for the growth of the monoclonal antibodies market. Increasing R&D pertaining to the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (or “mAb’s”) coupled with the structural complexity of therapeutic proteins and the increasing regulatory needs for molecular information all require new analytical capabilities from the Bioanalytics Industry.
 
According to a market research report, “Biomarkers: Technological and Commercial Outlook 2012 – 2022” (Visiongain, July 2012, https://www.visiongain.com/Report/852/Biomarkers-Technological-and-Commercial-Outlook-2012-2022) a related sector of the Bioanalytics Industry is the identification of disease-specific molecular “biomarkers.” Biomarkers are specific molecules, or panels of molecules, that have been found to be regulated in conjunction with specific disease states or drug treatments relevant to human health and disease. The human disease biomarker sector seeks to identify and validate biomolecules that are associated with the onset and progression of a specific disease, and thus can become new diagnostics, or biomarkers, to be used for personalized medicine, as well as companion diagnostics to guide new pharmaceutical development for specific patient subgroups. The global market for biomarkers in 2011 was $13.8 billion and expected to reach $37.68 billion in 2022.
 
Market for Melanoma Analysis 
 
According to research report, “Cancer Statistics, 2015, the U.S. market for analysis of indeterminate or borderline analysis of malignant melanoma is approximately $720 million annually. About 500,000 skin biopsies are labeled as indeterminate or borderline every year in the U.S.
 
According to the National Cancer Institute, there is an estimated 73,870 new cases of melanoma diagnosed in the USA in 2015. As a standard clinical practice, there are up to two million biopsies performed each year to rule out melanoma. Of these biopsies, 25% cannot be definitively classified using routine histopathology (Am J Surg Pathol, , 33, 1146-56, 2009). Currently, additional testing is necessary in order to assess the indeterminate skin biopsy samples.
 
Competition
 
We believe that our technology provides significant improvements over what is currently on the market. Bioanalytics is a major global industry and competition is expected to be broad-based; however, we believe that the industry also affords opportunities for commercial partnerships, such as our collaboration with Agilent (NYSE:A). The following list of competitors is not intended to be exhaustive, and there are other existing competitors and there likely will be new potential competitors in the future.

Sale of European Subsidiary
 
In December 2014, Protea Biosciences, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, completed the sale of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of ProteaBio Europe SAS, to AzurRx BioPharma, Inc. (“AzurRx”). Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “SPA”), we received the following consideration in exchange for the subsidiary:

(i) | an aggregate amount of $300,000 including $200,000 in cash and $100,000 from the forgiveness of outstanding indebtedness of the Company owed to AzurRx; 
------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | 100 shares of Series A Preferred Stock of AzurRx (the “Preferred Stock”) that was convertible into 33% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock of AzurRx; and 
(iii) | the right to receive certain other contingent consideration to be paid upon the satisfaction of certain events, including (a) a one-time milestone payment of $2,000,000 due within (10) days of receipt of the first approval by the FDA of a New Drug Application or Biologics License Application for a Business Product (as such term is defined in the SPA); (b) royalty payments equal to 2.5% of net sales of Business Product up to $100,000,000 and 1.5% of net sales of Business Product in excess of $100,000,000 and (c) ten percent (10%) of the Transaction Value (as defined in the SPA) received in connection with a sale or transfer of the pharmaceutical development business of Protea Europe.

As a result of the sale of ProteaBio Europe SAS in 2014, the Company received 100 shares of series a preferred stock of AzurRx, representing a 33% interest in AzurRx, as calculated on a fully diluted basis under that is the equity method of accounting. AzurRx is a private biotechnology company formed to focus on the development of the early stage pharmaceutical assets of ProteaBio Europe SAS. During 2016 and 2015, the Company coverted its series A Preferred shares into 2,439,365 shares of Common Stock of AzurRx. Also, throughout 2016 and 2015, the Company entered into several transactions to sell 1,706,974 shares and 606,667 shares of AzurRx, resulting in cash proceeds of $1,502,100, and $910,000, respectively. As a result of these transactions, the Company’s interest in AzurRx has been reduced to 1.7%.

Capitalization and Private Financings 
 
In order to obtain working capital to continue our research and the development of our business and sustain operations, we have relied upon a series of private offerings to accredited investors of our Common Stock, warrants and debt securities. The terms of these private placements have significantly increased the number of shares of our Common Stock that are outstanding and are subject to issuance upon exercise of warrants or conversion of convertible securities.
 
From November 2013 to December 2013, the Company issued in a private placement offering (the “2013 Offering”) approximately 77.87 units of Company securities (the “Units”), each Unit consisting of 200,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the ‘Common Stock”), warrants to purchase 200,000 shares of Common Stock (“2013 Class A Warrants”), and warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of Common Stock (“2013 Class B Warrants”), in exchange for gross proceeds of approximately $7.8 million ($100,000 per unit). The price per unit translated to of one share of Common Stock valued at $0.50 per share, one 2013 Class A Warrant and one-half 2013 Class B Warrant. A total of 15,524,642 shares of Common Stock, 15,524,642 of 2013 Class A Warrants, and 7,762,321 of 2013 Class B Warrants were issued in the 2013 Offering, and an additional 3,302,823 of 2013 Class B Warrants were issued to the placement agent in connection with the 2013 Offering. However, pursuant Unit Purchase Agreement executed in connection with the 2013 Offering, investors were entitled to receive anti-dilutive shares of Common Stock if the Company subsequently issued or sold Common Stock for consideration of less than $0.50 per share. As a result of our recent offering of Common Stock at a price of $0.075 per share, the 15,524,642 shares of Common Stock sold in the 2013 Offering increased to approximately 103,500,000 shares.
 
Between January 2014 and October 2016, we sold approximately $6,260,940 of notes to 13 investors, approximately $6,145,688 of short-term original issue discount notes and debentures (the “OID Debentures”), 3,707,775 shares of Preferred Stock, 22,802,759 shares of Common Stock and warrants to purchase 74,970,359 additional shares of our Common Stock. See “Part II – Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities” elsewhere in this Annual Report.
 
As at the date of this Annual Report, approximately $2,937,111 of our outstanding debt securities, including the majority of our OID Debentures have matured and are currently in default.
 
Pursuant to an amended and restated private placement memorandum dated as of October 31, 2016 (the “Memorandum”), commencing in October 2016 the Company initiated and continues to conduct a private placement offering though March 31, 2017 (the “2016-17 Offering”) of units of securities (the “Units”) consisting of (i) shares of Common Stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”) offered at a per share price of $0.075 per share, (ii) Class A Warrants to purchase additional shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.09 per share (the “2016-17 Class A Warrants”) and (iii) Class B Warrants to purchase additional shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.1125 per share (the “2016-17 Class B Warrants”). Each Unit, offered for a total of $10,000, consist of (i) 133,333.33 shares of Common Stock, (ii) 133,333.33 of 2016-17 Class A Warrants, and (iii) 133,333.33 of 2016-17 Class B Warrants. Each of the 2016-17 Class A Warrants and 2016-17 Class B Warrants contain “full-ratchet anti-dilution provisions that effectively reduce the exercise prices of both securities to $0.075 per share. As of December 31, 2016 we sold for an aggregate of $1,407,430, a total of 140.74 Units consisting of 18,765,729 shares of Common Stock and warrants to purchase 37,531,458 shares of our Common Stock.
 
As of the December 31, 2016, we had outstanding an aggregate of 162,471,373 shares of our Common Stock and an additional 85,724,996 shares of our Common Stock we are obligated to issue under anti-dilution provisions of our various outstanding securities. We also have outstanding $2,735,298 of convertible debt securities outstanding entitling the holders upon conversion to receive up to 32,099,227 shares of our Common Stock, outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 122,475,881 shares of Common Stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 25,244,337 to issue under anti-dilution provisions. The Company also has reserved an aggregate of shares of Common Stock for issuance under its 2002 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2002 Plan”) and shares of Common Stock have been reserved for issuance under the Company’s 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”). As of December 31, 2016, options to purchase an aggregate of 10,780,086 shares of Common Stock have been granted and are outstanding under the 2002 Plan and the 2013 Plan, collectively. Since January 1, 2017, we have issued Units of our equity securities in our private placement offering consisting of 7,573,332 additional shares of Common Stock and warrants to purchase 15,146,664 shares our Common Stock.
 
Accordingly, and based on the anti-dilution provisions contained in the offering documents related to our private placements, as at the date of this Annual Report, our “Fully-Diluted Common Stock” consists of 585,136,621 shares. Such fully-diluted shares include an aggregate of (a) 210,048,532 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding, (b) 85,724,996 shares of Common Stock we are currently obligated to issue under the anti-dilution provisions of our agreements with and securities issued to various investors, and (c) an additional 289,363,093 shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of convertible securities, issuance of anti-dilution warrants and the exercise of outstanding warrants and options.

Derivative Liability, Debt Defaults and Exchange Offers.
 
The anti-dilution provisions contained in many of our outstanding securities, including the Unit Purchase Agreements with respect to the Common Stock in both the 2013 Offering and the current 2016-17 Offering and the 2016-17 Class A Warrants and 2016-17 Class B Warrants included in the 2016-17 Offering has created significant derivative liabilities for the Company. As of December 31, 2016 such derivative liability has been calculated to be in excess of $3,100,000 and increases as we sell additional warrants. Such derivative liability directly impacts and reduces the Company’s stockholders equity which could materially and adversely affect our ability in the future to qualify to list our Common Stock for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market or other comparable national securities exchange.
 
In order to cure our defaults in payment of our debt securities and to reduce, if not eliminate, the derivative liability, on or before April 30, 2017, we intend to:
 

· | Enter into agreements with certain of our creditors, including members of our board of directors, to convert approximately $2,521,719 of our indebtedness and accrued interest of $92,319 owed to such individuals into shares of our Common Stock and 2016-17 Class A Warrants to purchase shares our Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.09 per share, and 2016-17 Class B Warrants to purchase shares our Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.1125 per share, all upon the same terms as the Units of equity securities offered in our 2016-17 Offering, except that the warrants do not contain any full ratchet or weighted average anti-dilution adjustments. See "Related Party Transactions" elsewhere in this Annual private placement. As the date of this Annual Report, 10 of our related parties have agreed to convert an aggregate of $2,521,719 of debt and $92,319 of interest into 34,853,829 shares of our Common Stock and 2016-17 Class A Warrants to purchase 34,853,829 shares our Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.09 per share, and 2016-17 Class B Warrants to purchase 34,853,829 shares our Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.1125 per share.

· | Offer to the holder(s) of all $2,270,438 of OID Debentures, an opportunity under Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to exchange their debentures for a new 20% OID convertible debenture due September 30, 2017, plus one share of our Common Stock for each $1.00 outstanding principal amount of the new 20% OID convertible debenture issued to them. As proposed, the contemplated restated 20% OID convertible debenture would be in face amount equal to 100% of the outstanding principal of and accrued interest on the earlier convertible debentures and, upon consummation of any subsequent public offering of our Common Stock that is registered under the Securities Act prior to the new maturity date, would be subject to mandatory conversion at a 20% discount to the initial public offering price of our Common Stock (the “OID Convertible Debenture Exchange Offer”). The OID Convertible Debenture Exchange Offering will be offered for a period expiring on the earlier of June 30, 2017 or acceptance of the OID Convertible Debenture Exchange Offer by 100% of the holders of such OID Debentures.

· | Offer to the 156 holders of our Common Stock and Warrants issued in the 2013 Offering, an opportunity under Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to (a) waive for all purposes the “make whole” provisions in their subscription agreement in exchange for one-quarter of a warrant exercisable at $0.09 per share for each of the 103.5 million shares of Common Stock issued and issuable to them in the 2013 Offering (approximately 26. Million additional warrants) which would contain no weighted average or full ratchet anti-dilution provisions, plus (b) exchange all of the outstanding 2013 A Warrants, and 2013 B Warrants issued in the 2013 Offering (approximately 11,000,000 warrants) for one additional share of our Common Stock (the “2013 Exchange Offer”). The proposed 2013 Exchange Offer will be offered for a period expiring on the earlier of June 30, 2017 or acceptance of the 2013 Exchange Offer by 100% of the investors.

Accordingly, each $10,000 Unit that represented 133,333 shares of Common Stock, plus 133,333 of 2016-17 Class A Warrants and 133,333 of 2016-17 Class B Warrants would be exchanged for 333,333 shares of Common Stock, representing (a) 133,333 shares of Common Stock, plus (ii) 200,000 additional shares of common stock issued in lieu of the 2016-17 Class A Warrants and 2016-17 Class B Warrants.

There can be no assurance that we will be successful in ether extending the maturity dates of our defaulted debt obligations or eliminating any significant amount of our derivative liabilities in connection with any or all of the above exchange offers. If we are not successful, our creditors could accelerate our debt obligations in which event we may be forced to seek protection for such creditors under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.

Our Authorized Common Stock Increase and Reverse Stock Split
 
Authorized Common Stock Increase.
 
On January 31, 2017, at a special meeting of the Board of Directors, our Board of Directors approved by unanimous vote to seek shareholder approval of certain proposals by written consent that, to adopt and effectuate, will require the majority consent of our stockholders. As of the date of this filing on Form 10-K, we have submitted these proposals to our stockholders pursuant to our definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A, filed on March 2, 2017 with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Under the proposals we are soliciting our stockholders written consent to approve the filing of an amended and restated certificate of incorporation in Delaware (“Restated Charter”), to increase the number of authorizes shares of our Common Stock, $0.0001 par value per share (“Common Stock”) from 500,000,000 shares of Common Stock to 750,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the “Authorized Common Stock Increase”), and with such Authorized Common Stock Increase to be effective at such time and date within one year after the date such action is approved by the Majority Stockholders, if at all, as determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion (the “Authorized Common Stock Increase Proposal”).
 
The reason for the Authorized Common Stock Increase Proposal is that as of April 13, 2017, we had issued and outstanding an aggregate of 209,915,199 shares of Common Stock, we are currently obligated to issue an additional 85,724,996 shares of Common Stock under the anti-dilution provisions of our agreements with and securities issued to various investors, and an additional 288,689,343 shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance upon conversion of convertible notes, the issuance of anti-dilution shares and the exercise of Common Stock purchase warrants that were then outstanding. Accordingly, as at the date of this Annual Report, our “Fully-Diluted Common Stock” consists of 584,329,538 shares. In addition, we are continuing to sell units of securities consisting of Common Stock at a price of $0.075 per shares and warrants to purchase Common stock at prices of $0.09 and $0.01125 per share to accredited investors in our current private placement offering.
 
Accordingly, without the increase of our authorized Common Stock to 750,000,000 shares, we will not have enough shares of Common Stock available to issue to holders of our convertible securities, options and warrants.
 
Reverse Stock Split
 
Included within our definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A, filed as of March 2, 2017 with the SEC, we submitted a proposal to our stockholders for written consent to approve the filing of an amended and restated certificate of incorporation in Delaware (the “Restated Charter”) or in a subsequent amendment to the Restated Charter, provisions to effect a reverse split of our issued and outstanding Common Stock, within a range of not less than one-for-fifteen (1:15) and not more than one-for-fifty (1:50), with such ratio to be determined by the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion (the “Reverse Split”), and with such Reverse Split to be effective at such time and date within one year after the date such action is approved by the stockholders, if at all, as determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion (the “Reverse Split Proposal”).
 
The Reverse Split proposal, including the final reduced number of shares of Common Stock into which our currently outstanding shares will be converted (within the stockholder-approved range referred to above), if approved by the consent of a majority of our stockholders, will be determined by our Board of Directors in order to list our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market which, in any event, shall become effective only (a) upon the approved filing of the Restated Charter to consummate the Reverse Split with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, including the final reduced number of shares of Common Stock into which our currently outstanding shares will be converted; and (b) upon announcement of the Reverse Split by FINRA.
 
In the event that we receive written consent from a majority of our stockholders entitled to vote thereunder approving the Reverse Split and, subsequently, our Board of Directors elects to consummate the Reverse Split on or prior to March 31, 2017, the Board of Directors will not effectuate the filing of the Restated Charter to consummate the Authorized Common Stock Increase. However, in the event that we do not consummate the Reverse Split on or prior to March 31, 2017, we will consummate the Authorized Common Stock Increase by filing the Restated Charter with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as soon as practicable following March 31, 2017. Even if we do consummate the Authorized Common Stock Increase on or about March 31, 2017, our Board of Directors will still reserve and maintain the right to consummate the Reverse Split at such time and date within one year after the date such action is approved by our stockholders, if at all, and as determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion (the “Reverse Split Proposal”). On April 4, 2017, the Company’s board of directors approved the Company’s decision to exercise such discretionary right by extending the deadline to receive written consents under the Consent Solicitation from the original date of March 30, 2017 to April 28, 2017.
 
If implemented, the Reverse Stock Split will only effect our outstanding Common Stock and shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of convertible securities and exercise of warrants and options. It will not effect the number of shares of Common Stock we are authorized to issue under our Restated Charter.
 
The purpose of the Reverse Split is to enable us to qualify our Common Stock for listing on a national stock exchange such as The Nasdaq Capital Market or the NYSE AMEX. Our Common Stock is currently traded on the OTC Markets OTCQB marketplace. Such trading market is considered to be less efficient than that provided by a stock exchange such as The Nasdaq Stock Market or NYSE AMEX. In order for us to list our Common Stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market or NYSE MKT, we must fulfill certain listing requirements, including minimum bid price requirements for our Common Stock.

--

 

In order to list our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market or the NYSE AMEX, among other requirements, our Common Stock must maintain a minimum closing bid price of $4.00 or a closing share price of $3.00 or $2.00, as applicable. As of April 13, 2017, the closing sale price of our Common Stock was only $0.08 per share on the OTC Markets OTCQB marketplace. We believe that completing the Reverse Split will result in an increase in our adjusted share price that may enable us to “uplist” our shares on the Nasdaq Capital Markets, assuming all of the other listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market or the NYSE AMEX have also been satisfied. There can be no assurance that following Reverse Split the market price of our Common Stock will increase, or will increase in such proportion to permit us to “uplist” our shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market or the NYSE AMEX. No assurance can be given that, even if we satisfy the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market or NYSE MKT, we will apply to have our Common Stock listed on either exchange, or that, if we do so apply, that our application will be approved, or that, if our Common Stock is listed on either exchange, we will be able to satisfy the maintenance requirements for continued listing. In addition, no assurances can be given that the market price for our Common Stock will increase in the same proportion as the reverse split or, if increased, that such price will be maintained.
 
The following table depicts the prospective effects of the Reverse Split on the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding, the number of shares of our Common Stock reserved for future issuance upon conversion of convertible debt and exercise of options and warrants and the number of authorized but unissued and unreserved shares of our Common Stock that would be available for issuance after the Reverse Split. As discussed above, the number of shares of our Common Stock authorized for issuance under our Certificate of Incorporation would remain unaffected by the Reverse Split.
 

 | Common Stock Outstanding (1) | | Shares Reserved for Issuance (2) | | Shares Available for Issuance (3)

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company 
 
We are an "emerging growth company," as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) December 31, 2019, the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our Common Stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under applicable SEC rules. We expect that we will remain an emerging growth company for the foreseeable future, but cannot retain our emerging growth company status indefinitely and will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company on or before December 31, 2019. We refer to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 herein as the "JOBS Act," and references herein to "emerging growth company" have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from specified disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.

These exemptions include: 
 

· | being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" disclosure;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | not being required to comply with the requirement of auditor attestation of our internal controls over financial reporting; 


· | not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and 
· | not being required to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

 
For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we expect that we will take advantage of the reduced disclosure obligations available to us as a result of that classification. We have taken advantage of certain of those reduced reporting burdens in this prospectus. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock. 
 
An emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will not be required to adopt new or revised accounting standards on the dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public reporting companies. 
 
We are also a "smaller reporting company" as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and have elected to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosure available for smaller reporting companies.
