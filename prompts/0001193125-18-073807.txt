Item 1. Business 
Company Overview 
 Bojangles, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, Bojangles, we, us, our, or the Company) was incorporated in Delaware in 2011. 
 Its Bo Time! 
 Bojangles is a highly differentiated and growing restaurant operator and franchisor dedicated to serving customers high-quality, craveable food made from our Southern recipes. Since 1977, we believe Bojangles has become an iconic brand with a cult-like following due to our famous, made-from-scratch biscuits baked every 20 minutes, our fresh, never-frozen bone-in fried chicken, our unique fixins and our Legendary Iced Tea. We believe we offer fast-casual quality food combined with quick-service speed, convenience and value. While we serve our full menu of craveable food across all dayparts, we are especially known by customers for our breakfast offerings and generated, on average, approximately $620,000 in fiscal 2017 per company-operated restaurant before 11:00 a.m. In fiscal 2017, our 325 company-operated and 439 franchised restaurants, primarily located in the Southeastern United States, generated approximately $1.3 billion in system-wide sales, representing $518.4 million in company-operated restaurant revenues and $760.0 million in franchise sales, which contributed $29.1 million in franchise royalty and other franchise revenues. Over this same period, our restaurants generated a system-wide AUV of approximately $1.8 million, which we believe is among the highest in the quick-service restaurant (QSR) and fast-casual segments. Our mission is to win the hearts of our customers by delivering quality and service all day, every day, and we believe our passionate team members and culture are fundamental to our success. The excitement for our brand and enthusiasm of our customers can be best summarized by our famous tagline Its Bo Time! 
 Since our founding in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1977, our core menu centered on chicken n biscuits has remained largely unchanged. We believe our variety of fresh, flavorful and Southern-inspired items appeals to a broad customer demographic across our five dayparts: breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner and after dinner. Bojangles is known for its breakfast menu, which is served all day, every day, and includes our popular Cajun Filet Biscuit. We also offer hand-breaded, bone-in chicken marinated for at least 12 hours, Chicken Supremes, Homestyle Chicken Tenders and sandwiches, as well as unique fixins including our Seasoned Fries, Bo-Tato Rounds, Cajun Pintos and Dirty Rice. Our 500 Calorie and Under menu features items such as salads, grilled chicken sandwiches, and fat-free green beans. In addition to our individual menu items, we offer combos and family meals that appeal to large parties, as well as our Big Bo Box, which is perfect for tailgating events. Our food is complemented by our Legendary Iced Tea that is steeped the old-fashioned way, providing a rich flavor that our customers crave. Our high-quality, handcrafted food also represents a great value with an average check of only $7.28 for company-operated restaurants in fiscal 2017. We believe our distinct menu with fresh, made-from-scratch offerings combined with a compelling average check creates an attractive value proposition for our customers. 
Our Industry 
 The U.S. restaurant industry is divided into two segments: full service and limited service. Full service is comprised of the casual dining, mid-scale and fine dining sub-segments. We operate within the limited service segment (LSR), which is comprised of the QSR and fast-casual sub-segments. QSRs are defined by Technomic as traditional fast-food restaurants with average check sizes of $3.00-$8.00. Fast-casual is defined by Technomic as a limited or self-service format with average check sizes of $8.00-$12.00 that offers food prepared to order within a generally more upscale and developed establishment. Our restaurants combine elements of both QSRs and fast-casual restaurants. Our restaurants convenient locations and format, drive-thru service and average check are attributes that we share with QSRs (rather than with the fast-casual segment generally), while the quality of our food, the freshness of our ingredients and our traditional cooking methods (as opposed to utilizing microwaves) are attributes that we generally share with fast-casual restaurants.

 According to Technomic, 2016 sales for the total LSR category increased 4.5% from 2015 to $268 billion. We offer fast-casual quality food combined with quick-service speed, convenience and value across multiple dayparts. We believe our differentiated, high-quality menu, including our extensive breakfast offerings that deliver great value all day, every day, positions us to compete successfully against both QSR and fast-casual concepts, providing us with a large addressable market. 
 We believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from a number of culinary and demographic trends in the United States: 
 Growing Breakfast Daypart: According to MillerPulse, total morning meal dollars grew from $53 billion in 2011 to $75 billion in 2017, representing a CAGR of 6.0%. In addition, sales for the QSR morning meal daypart grew from $42 billion in 2011 to $58 billion in 2017, representing a CAGR of 6.0%. Several factors are driving growth in the breakfast daypart, including more extensive menu offerings and consumers desire for value, portability and convenience. Consumers breakfast eating habits tend to be more habitual than other meals because breakfast is part of many consumers morning routines. 
 Increasing Chicken Category: In 2016, the chicken menu category for LSRs grew 7.5% from 2015, outpacing the broader LSR category, according to Technomic. 
 Population Growth in Our Markets: Since 2000, population growth in our key markets has exceeded the U.S. national average. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, growth in the Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee populations from 2000 to 2017 was on average 23.4%, as compared to 15.4% population growth in the U.S. over that same period. 
The Bo Difference 
 We believe the following strengths differentiate us and serve as the foundation for our continued growth: 
 Iconic Brand with Loyal, Cult-Like Following. Since opening our first restaurant in North Carolina in 1977, we believe we have become an iconic brand with a cult-like following by consistently delivering differentiated, craveable food. We believe our Bo Fanatics, which is our term for our most loyal customers, visit us multiple times per week and promote our brand through word of mouth and engagement on social media. We support our brand through high profile sponsorships of sporting events and venues, such as the Bojangles Southern 500, as well as endorsements from celebrities who are fans of Bojangles. We believe our iconic brand and cult-like following support our ability to grow our restaurant base in existing and new markets. 
 High-Quality, Craveable Food. We are committed to maintaining the integrity of our traditional, Southern food. We believe our customers crave the unique flavor of our food and the variety of our menu, which includes our signature breakfast biscuits, bone-in fried chicken, Chicken Supremes, Homestyle Chicken Tenders, sandwiches, unique fixins, and our 500 Calorie and Under menu. We use high-quality ingredients prepared the old-fashioned way and do not have microwaves in our restaurants. As an example of our commitment to quality, all of our specially trained biscuit makers follow 48 steps in preparing our made-from-scratch, buttermilk biscuits, which are baked fresh every 20 minutes. We prepare eggs, sausage and cured country ham on the griddle for our breakfast menu served all day. For our unique fixins, we prepare our famous Dirty Rice and Cajun Pintos on the stove-top, and our Seasoned Fries are made with our special blend of seasonings. Finally, we steep our Legendary Iced Tea to ensure a rich brewed flavor that our customers crave. This commitment to offering high-quality food with unique flavor that we believe customers cannot find at other restaurants has earned us deep customer loyalty and a high frequency of visits. 
 Diversified Daypart Mix. We have a diversified daypart mix that supports AUVs that are among the highest in the QSR and fast-casual segments: 
 Our Famous Breakfast: While many of our competitors do not offer breakfast, in fiscal 2017, we generated 37% of our company-operated restaurant revenues before 11:00 a.m., or an average of 
 
2 


  approximately $620,000 annually per company-operated restaurant. Our strong breakfast results make us a leader in an attractive daypart in the industry. Furthermore, we believe breakfast has broad customer appeal and is the most habitual daypart, which drives repeat business and customer loyalty. 
 Our Craveable Menu for Lunch, Snack, Dinner and After Dinner: In fiscal 2017, we generated 63% of our company-operated restaurant revenues from 11:00 a.m. to closing, which is typically 10:00 p.m. We believe Bojangles menu, focused on high-quality, craveable items, is distinct in the LSR industry and provides an attractive value proposition for lunch, snack, dinner and after dinner. Our Big Bo Box, family and tailgate meals cater to group occasions and drive sales during these dayparts. Additionally, our customers can order our famous breakfast items all day, which we believe differentiates us from our peers and delivers great value at all hours. 
 Unique Value Proposition: Fast-Casual Quality Food with QSR Speed, Convenience and Value. Everything we do is driven by our intense focus on delivering a compelling value proposition to our customers. We believe that our concept combines elements of both fast-casual restaurants (quality and food preparation) and QSR (speed, convenience and value). Our value proposition is a key element of our business: 
 High-Quality Ingredients: We cook our food using high-quality ingredients. For example, our menu features our famous biscuits, which are made from fresh buttermilk, and our bone-in fried chicken, which is fresh and never-frozen. Our menu also includes items such as our Country Ham Biscuit made from traditionally dry-cured country ham and our Sausage Biscuit made from high-quality sausage with a blend of seasonings prepared especially for Bojangles. Our Legendary Iced Tea is steeped the old-fashioned way and is never made from concentrates or poured from bottles or cans. 
 Traditional Food Preparation: We prepare our food the old-fashioned way, and never in a microwave. Our restaurant kitchens are specifically designed for our employees to prepare our food in a traditional manner; for example, our bone-in chicken is hand-breaded and is marinated for at least 12 hours. Many of our menu items are made-from-scratch and are cooked in the oven, on the griddle or on the stove-top.
Compelling Speed and Convenience: We locate our restaurants in places that are easily accessible and convenient to customers homes, places of work and daily commutes. We also strive to deliver our food quickly to our customers, whether in our restaurants or through our drive-thru. We believe our customers appreciate our speed and convenience, as evidenced by over 80% of our company-operated restaurant revenues in fiscal 2017 generated via drive-thru and carry-out.
Attractive Price Point: Our average check was $7.28 for company-operated restaurants in fiscal 2017. We believe this average check is lower than any fast-casual and most QSR restaurant concepts. 
 Compelling Hybrid System that Provides Capital Efficient Growth. Our hybrid system captures the earnings power of a company-operated model with strong economics and the capital efficiency of a franchised model. As of December 31, 2017, 43% of our restaurant base was company-operated and 57% was franchised. 
 Company-Operated: As of December 31, 2017 we had 325 company-operated restaurants, which has grown from 196 as of the end of fiscal 2011, representing a CAGR of 8.8%. In fiscal 2017, our company-operated restaurants generated $518.4 million in revenues, which increased from $281.9 million in fiscal 2011. This sales growth contributed to our restaurant contribution increase from $44.3 million in fiscal 2011 to $80.6 million in fiscal 2017, representing a CAGR of 10.5%. With approximately 43% of the restaurant base operated by the company, we are aligned with our franchisees and take a leadership role in executing brand and operational initiatives. Our company-operated restaurants have achieved strong performance, thereby illustrating to franchisees the potential of our brand and generating significant credibility within our franchise base. 
 Franchised: As of December 31, 2017, our franchisees operated 439 restaurants, which has grown from 312 as of fiscal 2011, representing a CAGR of 5.9%. Royalties and other franchise revenues totaled 
 
3 


  $29.1 million in fiscal 2017, which increased from $18.0 million in fiscal 2011. We believe royalties and fees generated from our franchise base provide us with significant, predictable cash flow to invest in executing our strategies. Our approximately 90 franchise entities are important partners in our system-wide growth as they allow us to expand the Bojangles brand in new and existing markets in a capital efficient manner. 
 Highly Productive Restaurant Base with Strong Unit Economics. We believe our differentiated customer value proposition generates strong restaurant-level financials and attractive returns on investment. For fiscal 2017, our system-wide AUV was approximately $1.8 million, which we believe is among the highest in the QSR and fast-casual segments. Our new company-operated restaurant model targets strong cash flows and compelling cash-on-cash returns. Unlike some other restaurant concepts, we primarily utilize build-to-suit developments and equipment financing leases for our new company-operated restaurants, which requires minimal upfront investment for construction and equipment costs. Our new company-operated restaurant model is based on a year one target AUV of $1.5 million, as well as restaurant-level cash flow of approximately $110,000 and average upfront cash equipment investment of approximately $85,000 for locations under build-to-suit and equipment financing leases. Given our build-to-suit and equipment financing lease strategy that minimizes our upfront cash investment, our new company-operated restaurant model delivers, on average, a less than one-year payback on cash investment for these locations, which we are able to assess once the restaurant has been open for a full twelve months. Our new company-operated restaurants that utilize a build-to-suit and equipment financing lease strategy and opened during fiscal year 2016, which is the most recent class for which a full twelve months of results is available, fell short of meeting our targets. On average, we have exceeded the one-year payback on cash investment target for our new company-operated restaurants utilizing a build-to-suit and equipment financing lease strategy that were opened during fiscal years 2012-2016. We believe our low cash investment provides a platform for compelling returns on our new restaurants. See Construction for more information. 
 Strong Management Team Driving Culture Based on People. We have a highly experienced management team. Our leadership team is committed to instilling our strong culture, which is based on trust, servant leadership and total commitment in all that we do. Our values of hard work, teamwork, harmony, listening and respect underlie everything that we do, both in our interactions with each other and with customers. We view our restaurant-level employees as the true heroes of our business, working daily to deliver our high-quality food with a strong sense of pride in our brand. We believe our strong management team and commitment to a culture based on people and integrity are key drivers of our success as a differentiated restaurant concept and position us well for long-term growth. 
 Spreading the Bo-Buzz
We plan to pursue the following strategies to continue to grow our revenues and profits: 
 Continue to Open New Company-Operated and Franchised Restaurants. We believe we are in the early stages of our growth story. We have expanded our system-wide restaurant count from 508 restaurants as of the end of fiscal 2011 to 764 restaurants as of the end of fiscal 2017, representing a CAGR of 7.0%. In fiscal 2017, we opened 26 company-operated restaurants and 26 franchised restaurants, contributing to annual system-wide unit growth of 6.7%. We continue to expand our footprint into adjacent markets and expect our franchisees will continue to lead our expansion efforts because we intend to open fewer new company-operated restaurants on a go-forward basis. Given the strength of our brand, existing restaurant base and new unit economics, we believe we can continue opening restaurants in our core North Carolina and South Carolina markets. Additionally, given the performance of our 314 company-operated and franchised restaurants in adjacent markets as of December 31, 2017, we believe there is a significant opportunity to continue to grow in our existing footprint.

 Drive Comparable Restaurant Sales. We strive to deliver comparable restaurant sales growth through the following strategies: 
 Attract New Customers Through Expanded Brand Awareness: We expect to attract new customers as Bojangles becomes more widely known due to new restaurant openings and marketing efforts focused on broadening the reach and appeal of our brand. We expect consumers will become more familiar with Bojangles as we continue to penetrate our markets, which we believe will benefit our existing restaurant base. Our marketing strategy centers on our Its Bo Time campaign, which highlights the craveability and made-from-scratch quality of our food. We also utilize social media community engagement and public relations to increase the reach of our brand. Additionally, our system will benefit from increased contributions to our marketing and various co-op advertising funds as we continue to grow our restaurant base. 
 Increase Existing Customer Frequency: We are striving to increase customer frequency by providing Bo-Size Service, a service experience and environment that compliments the quality of our food and models our culture. We expect to accomplish this by enhancing customer engagement, while also improving throughput, order execution and quality. Additionally, in early fiscal 2014 we began implementing a customer experience measurement system, which provides us with real-time feedback and customers insights to enhance our service experience. We also previously announced that we have or will be strategically adding labor initiatives, such as enhanced service and more full-time versus part-time team members, where we believe it will significantly enhance the customer service experience over time. We believe that always striving for excellent customer service will create an experience and environment that will support increased existing customer visits. 
 Continue to Grow Dayparts: We believe we have an opportunity to complement our strong breakfast daypart with our lunch, snack, dinner and after dinner dayparts. We expect to drive growth across these dayparts through optimized labor and management allocation, enhanced menu offerings, innovative merchandising and marketing campaigns, such as our Big Bo Box packaging and Tailgate Everything campaign, which have successfully driven growth in our post-breakfast dayparts over time. We plan to continue to introduce and market limited time offers to increase occasions across our dayparts as well as to educate customers on our lunch and dinner offerings. 
 Leverage Technology. We are investing in new technology, such as our new point-of-sale system, XPIENT, which will allow us to enhance efficiency and throughput in our restaurants. The installation of XPIENT in all company-operated restaurants was completed in fiscal 2015. Additionally, we introduced the Bojangles Mobile App during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, which includes features such as mobile payment and our Bo Rewards customer loyalty program. Further, we are targeting fiscal 2018 for the roll out the next phase of our Bojangles Mobile App launch, which we expect to include mobile ordering from a limited menu of select Bojangles favorites, like our Big Bo Boxes for tailgating and large catering events. We believe the launch of, and future enhancements to, the Bojangles Mobile App will improve our customer experience, capture large group ordering and increase transactions. 
 Continue to Enhance Profitability. We focus on expanding our profitability over the long term while also investing in personnel, technology and infrastructure to support our future growth. We will seek to further enhance our long-term margins by maintaining fiscal discipline and leveraging fixed costs. We constantly focus on restaurant-level operations, including cost controls, while ensuring that we do not sacrifice the quality and service for which we are known. Additionally, as our restaurant base grows, we believe we will be able to leverage support costs over the long term as general and administrative expenses grow at a slower rate than our revenues.

 Our Food 
 Our Menu 
 Our core menu has been centered on chicken n biscuits since our founding in 1977. We believe we offer craveable, Southern-inspired food with unique flavor that customers cannot find at other restaurants. We prepare our food using high-quality ingredients with many of our items made-from-scratch, and we do not permit microwave ovens in any of our restaurants, ever. Our menu includes our famous, made-from-scratch, buttermilk biscuits baked fresh every 20 minutes; our fresh, never-frozen bone-in fried chicken; our unique fixins; our 500 Calorie or Under menu items such as salads, our grilled chicken sandwich, and fat-free green beans; our freshly baked and delicious sweets menu; and our Legendary Iced Tea. Our goal is that every menu item at Bojangles has a unique or special flavor that differentiates our restaurants and our brand. 
 Our food is offered a la carte and in combos which may be favorably priced compared to individual orders. A Bojangles customer may order a single piece of chicken or one of our chicken dinners with a choice of our unique fixins, and always accompanied by a made-from-scratch, fresh buttermilk biscuit. Our chicken, fixins, biscuits and Legendary Iced Tea may also be ordered in boxes or family meals, and larger combinations may be offered as tailgate specials or may be packaged in our iconic Big Bo Box. The addition of boxes, family meals and tailgate specials to our menu has helped increase our dinner and carry-out business over time, resulting in a higher average check and comparable restaurant sales growth over time. 
 Breakfast 
 We are especially known for our breakfast offering, which is served all day, every day. Each morning, our specially trained and certified biscuit makers begin preparing our made-from-scratch biscuits, which are made using fresh buttermilk and flour. Biscuit sandwiches are typically made-to-order with combinations of chicken, ham, sausage, cheese, eggs, gravy and other fillings. Our Cajun Filet Biscuit is our most popular biscuit sandwich, featuring our marinated chicken filet with special Cajun-inspired seasonings. For our ham biscuits, we use dry-cured country ham that is rubbed with salt, sugar and other ingredients and then cured for 90 days and our steak biscuits are made with breaded chopped steak. We also offer limited-time-only biscuit sandwiches utilizing the same made-from-scratch biscuit platform, including our grilled pork chop biscuit. To complement our biscuits, many customers choose our Bo-Tato Rounds, which are mini seasoned hash browns fried to a golden brown, and our BoTown Roasters coffee. 
 Below are just a few of our breakfast biscuits served all day, every day: 
 

Cajun Chicken Filet | Country Ham | Sausage | Steak | Gravy

Lunch, Snack, Dinner and After Dinner 
 Our menu centers on our fresh, never-frozen, bone-in chicken and a variety of unique fixins. Our bone-in chicken is marinated for at least 12 hours, and then hand-dipped and breaded before cooking. In addition to our bone-in chicken, we offer our Chicken Supremes and our Homestyle Chicken Tenders, which have a milder flavor profile, both of which are made with boneless whole breast chicken select tenderloin. 
 To accompany our chicken, we offer our famous fixins including our Dirty Rice and Cajun Pintos which are cooked on the stove-top. For our Dirty Rice, we use sausage made to our specification using our exclusive blend of seasonings, and our Cajun Pintos are prepared using our exclusive ranchero style seasonings. Our Seasoned 
 
6 


  Fries are skin-on, entrée fries which are sprinkled with our special seasoning blend. In addition, we offer Southern style mac n cheese made from two cheeses; fat-free green beans; cole slaw; and mashed potatoes with gravy. We also offer flavorful bowls, which include our Chicken Rice Bowl and our JamBolaya Bowl, each served with a biscuit. 
 

2-Piece Dinner | Fixins | Chicken Supremes | Chicken Rice Bowl | 20-Piece Tailgate

 Our menu also features salads, sandwiches and our whole meat Roasted Chicken Bites. For our sandwiches, our customers can order grilled chicken or a Cajun Filet on a toasted bun. Our sandwiches are served with crisp lettuce and fresh tomato, with the option of adding hardwood-smoked bacon and sharp American cheese. We offer salads, made fresh daily and featuring a mix of crisp romaine and iceberg lettuce, red cabbage, grated carrots, sliced cucumber, grape tomatoes and Monterey jack and cheddar cheese. Our customers can also add our seasoned, grilled chicken breast filet, Roasted Chicken Bites and boneless whole breast tenderloin filets to our salads for a delicious and satisfying meal. 
 

Grilled Chicken Sandwich | Chicken Supremes Salad | Grilled Chicken Salad | Roasted Chicken Bites

 In addition, we serve a selection of sweets including our customers favorite Bo-Berry Biscuit, which is a made-from-scratch sweet biscuit, freshly baked and topped with delicious icing. We also offer our cinnamon biscuit and our signature sweet potato pie. 
 

Bo-Berry Biscuit | Cinnamon Biscuit | Sweet Potato Pie

 Overall, we believe our differentiated menu of high-quality, hand-crafted food represents a great value with an average check of only $7.28 for company-operated restaurants in fiscal 2017. 
 Restaurant Design 
 Our typical full-size restaurant is a modern, free-standing building which is approximately 3,900 square feet in size and can seat approximately 70 customers. Our restaurant locations are typically free-standing urban or suburban locations, and are located on approximately one acre of land and include a drive-thru window and approximately 45 parking spaces. Our restaurants are characterized by a unique exterior and interior design, color schemes, and layout, including specially designed decor and furnishings. The exterior of our current restaurant design is characterized by orange mansard roofs, tall brick towers and stucco arches. Restaurant interiors incorporate modern designs and rich colors in an effort to provide a clean and inviting environment and fun, family-friendly atmosphere.

 During fiscal 2016, we completed the initial phase of our Bojangles of the Future project, which included a complete review of the interior and exterior design of our restaurants, as well as what elements could potentially be incorporated into future restaurant remodels. Our new restaurant design features a distinctive, contemporary exterior that combines sophisticated materials like brick and tile, as well as steel canopies. Soft lighting and landscaped planters alongside the building and in the drive-thru lane are designed to provide the restaurant with a warm, welcoming feel. The new restaurant interior will center on the star of the Bojangles menuour made-from-scratch biscuits. Upon entering the restaurant and proceeding to the counter, guests will be able to view our new Biscuit Theater where they can watch biscuits being made fresh every 20 minutes by a Bojangles Master Biscuit Maker. The dining room will also get a refresh with wireless internet, multi-device electrical charging stations, unique high-top community tables and a variety of seating options to accommodate different sized groups. During fiscal 2017, we unveiled our new restaurant design, which we believe will enhance our brand and unit growth opportunity. During fiscal 2017, we opened a total of five company-operated Bojangles of the Future locations and completed three remodels that included many of the design elements in the Bojangles of the Future prototype. 
 Although we have not yet determined if the Bojangles of the Future will become our system-wide new unit standard, certain of these design features are being incorporated into current construction projects. We believe our Kitchen of the Future redesign, which is now a new unit standard for our company-operated full-size restaurants, will support greater efficiency, better throughput and increased transactions. 
 In addition to our standard restaurants, as of December 31, 2017, we had 38 locations that were either Bojangles Express or drive-thru only. Bojangles Express restaurants are located in or attached to another business or other structures such as shopping malls, food courts, travel plazas, grocery stores, college campuses, airports, transportation centers, military bases or convention centers or sports arenas and may be as small as 800 square feet and as large as 3,800 square feet. Bojangles Express locations may be part of a larger structure or complex. 
 Site Selection and Expansion 
 New Restaurant Development 
 We believe our restaurant model is designed to generate compelling cash flow, restaurant-level financial results and returns on invested capital, which we believe provide us with an attractive foundation for expansion. In fiscal 2015, we opened 29 company-operated and 34 franchised restaurants, in fiscal 2016, we opened 29 company-operated and 29 franchised restaurants and in fiscal 2017, we opened 26 company-operated and 26 franchised restaurants, contributing to annual system-wide unit growth of 6.4% in fiscal 2015, 8.2% in fiscal 2016 and 6.7% in fiscal 2017. We continue to expand our footprint into adjacent markets and expect our franchisees will continue to lead our expansion efforts as we intend to open fewer new company-operated restaurants on a go-forward basis. 
 Strategic Growth Plan 
 Our strategic plan targets opening both company-operated and franchised restaurant units, increasing comparable restaurant sales and growing AUVs. This integrated strategy seeks to expand our market share by further penetrating existing markets and growing into primarily contiguous new markets, leveraging our brand awareness. Our expansion into new markets typically follows a pattern over the long term of increasing AUVs as more consumers discover Bojangles and become loyal to our brand and food. Increasing restaurant penetration and leveraging our broader marketing programs drive the conversion of customers in new markets. As we penetrate existing markets and enhance our market share, more marketing dollars are available and we are able to increase our marketing spending through the use of various media types, benefiting both new and existing restaurants. When a marketing region reaches a specified level of penetration, the region is elevated to a new marketing threshold which allows for higher impact advertising and drives traffic across the region. We experience significantly higher AUVs in Designated Market Areas (DMAs) where our restaurant density is 
 
8 


  high enough to support elevated marketing spending. Our growth strategy is to continue opening restaurants in DMAs where we have higher unit penetration. In addition, we plan to open restaurants in DMAs where we have lower unit penetration so that we can achieve the unit density required to benefit from pooled marketing dollars and increased customer awareness. 
 Site Selection Process 
 We consider the location of a restaurant to be a critical variable in its long-term success and as such, we devote significant effort to the investigation and evaluation of potential restaurant locations. Our in-house development team has significant real estate experience in the restaurant industry. We adhere to a disciplined restaurant site selection plan, which contains criteria based on a variety of factors, including population, demographics, access to breakfast traffic, unit visibility and acceptable ingress and egress. This detailed site selection plan allows us to target new restaurant locations primarily on the going-to-work side of the street to support breakfast sales, and near traffic light intersections on thoroughfares typically travelled by approximately 20,000 cars or more per day. In addition, we use a third-party data analytics tool to assist in the site selection, and acquire information from data services to support our analysis. New company-operated and franchised restaurants are reviewed and approved by our real estate committee, which includes our senior leadership team. 
Construction 
 On average, it takes approximately one year from identification of a specific site to the opening of a new restaurant, which includes approximately five to six months of due diligence review of the site and three to four months of construction time. Our new restaurants are typically ground-up prototypes but may include conversions. We estimate the land, building and equipment of a new company-operated restaurant requires an average investment of approximately $2.7 million, including approximately $0.8 million for land, approximately $1.5 million for the building construction, which includes the building and site and soft costs, and approximately $0.4 million for equipment. We primarily utilize build-to-suit developments and equipment financing leases for our new company-operated restaurants, requiring minimal upfront cash investment. Each new company-operated restaurant under a build-to-suit development and equipment financing lease typically requires an upfront cash equipment investment of approximately $85,000, and we target a year one cash-on-cash payback for our new company-operated restaurants utilizing build-to-suit development and an equipment financing lease. While we primarily utilize a build-to-suit development strategy, our new restaurant strategy may change over time. We expect our average investment for new company-operated restaurants to increase related to our Bojangles of the Future project. In addition, if our Bojangles of the Future project is successful, we may undertake more remodels than in previous years, which we expect will increase our total and average investment for remodels as we incorporate the new design elements. 
Restaurant Management and Operations 
 Service Philosophy 
 We are extremely focused on customer service. In fiscal 2014, we introduced Bo-Size Service, which aims to deliver a Star Service experience and environment that compliments the quality of our food and models our culture. Our Star Service culture includes key points of differencespeak to me, act like you care, hurry, get it right and bring me backwhich are defined as the simple, but specific, opportunities for us to elevate the level of our service and customer satisfaction. We believe the key points of difference provide us a competitive advantage and a unique opportunity to exceed our customers expectations. Understanding these points of difference, developing a culture of genuine customer-service values, and implementing them properly is an essential element of new team member training. 
 We utilize tools such as our Bo-Sat Monitor guest survey program, which is powered by the Service Management Group, to capture and measure customer feedback. During fiscal 2016, we completed the rollout of 
 
9 


  our Bo-Sat Monitor program to our franchise community, which allowed the entire Bojangles system to operate under the same program. We believe this industry standard yields valuable data that is informing decisions across the organization, and transforming the way some things are done. As a result of knowledge gained with this effort, we believe we can now dig much deeper into customer service opportunities and potentially elevate the Bojangles experience even higher for all our customers. 
 We also previously announced that we have and will be strategically adding labor initiatives, such as service enhancements and more full-time versus part-time team members, where we believe it will significantly enhance the customer service experience over time. 
 Quality, Food Safety and Handling Procedures 
 We and our franchisees are focused on maintaining high food quality and food safety in each restaurant through the careful training and supervision of personnel and by following rigorous quality and cleanliness standards that have been established. Standards for food preparation and cleaning procedures are defined, monitored and maintained by our Operations and Training Departments. In company-operated restaurants, we utilize third-party inspectors to regularly monitor restaurant performance through food safety audits. As part of our food quality assurance program, we have processes in place to monitor, as well as inspect and evaluate production runs of our products to ensure they meet specifications mutually agreed upon with our suppliers. 
Managers and Team Members 
 Our restaurants operate with five distinct dayparts (breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner and after dinner) and a staff of approximately 30 to 35 team members on average led by the unit director, assistant unit directors, and shift managers. Quality is constantly monitored by area directors at company-operated restaurants and by franchise business consultants (FBCs) at franchised restaurants. 
 Before, during and after our restaurants are serving customers, our team members focus intensely on daily operational execution. Our hard working and dedicated team members typically begin food preparation an hour before the restaurant opens and continue through closing. Bojangles has a strict pre-closing policy that keeps each member of the team focused on customer service. Each team member has responsibility for cleaning throughout the day and the entire unit is thoroughly cleaned each night. The restaurant level management team utilizes proven operational systems such as The Managers Walk to effectively manage each shift. 
 We are diligent in our team member selection processes, only hiring approximately 10% of those who began the application process in fiscal 2017. We aim to staff our restaurants with team members that are friendly, customer-focused, driven to provide high-quality food, and who are also a good fit for our culture. As of December 31, 2017, our team member base was comprised of approximately 9,650 restaurant employees and approximately 250 support center personnel. 
 The heart of our business is our people and we encourage them to possess a strong sense of pride in their jobs and to excel by participating in competitions that test and reward high performing restaurants and team members. Our ShowBo competition focuses on rewarding and recognizing the best team and involves unannounced visits to evaluate each restaurant on service, quality and cleanliness. 
 Our Master Biscuit Makers 
 Our reputation is built on our signature chicken n biscuits. Our biscuit makers are at the heart of our business, baking made-from-scratch biscuits all day, every day in our restaurants system-wide. Our biscuit makers strictly follow our 48-step biscuit recipe, which includes using fresh buttermilk, hand rolling and cutting the dough and baking biscuits fresh in the oven every 20 minutes to ensure a consistent offering for every customer. We maintain high standards for our biscuit makers and require them to be re-certified every year to make sure we are providing the best possible biscuits for our customers. 
 
10 


 To highlight our strong sense of pride in our biscuit makers and how vital they are to our business, we encourage them to excel in annual competitions that test and reward high performers. Our annual Master Biscuit Maker Challenge brings together team members from across our entire system of restaurants to compete for the honor of being named one of our Champion Master Biscuit Makers. Each participant is judged on their ability to adhere to our 48-step biscuit recipe, taking into account the size, shape and color of the biscuits and time it takes to complete the process without sacrificing quality. The finalists for the competition have earned the highest scores out of hundreds of biscuit makers at the individual restaurant, area and regional levels and are invited to the final round at our headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. The competition serves as a reminder to all team members who the real heroes of our company are and illustrates the pride our team members have in delivering our biscuit magic. 
 Training 
 We ensure that new unit directors in company-operated restaurants possess the experience and passion necessary to deliver strong performance, and we support them with five to seven weeks of training in the Bojangles training program, including one week at our training center located in Charlotte, North Carolina and known as Bojangles University. Many of our new restaurants draw experienced team members from nearby locations, in addition to utilizing an all-star team provided by the company to support the workforce from the opening day through the early weeks of operation. Leveraging our base of existing team members ensures that new restaurants operate seamlessly from day one and cultivates Bojangles workplace culture, key drivers of our continued success and that of our franchisees. 
 We allow our and our franchisees principal operating officer or partner, managers and other restaurant team members to attend optional training programs and seminars that we offer from time to time. We currently provide training in our certified company-operated restaurants and Bojangles University. The initial training program is approximately five to seven weeks in duration consisting of classroom instruction and on-the-job training, and is conducted approximately 10 times per year. We bear the cost of maintaining Bojangles University, including the overhead costs of training, staff salaries, materials and training tools. We require each trainee to complete the training program to our satisfaction in order to be certified as a Bojangles company-operated restaurant manager. 
Franchise Program 
 Overview 
 We use a franchising strategy to increase new restaurant growth, leveraging the ownership of entrepreneurs with specific local market expertise and requiring a relatively minimal capital commitment by us. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 90 franchise entities that operated 439 restaurants. Our franchisees range in size from single-restaurant operators to the largest franchisee, which operated 66 restaurants as of December 31, 2017. Our existing franchise base consists of many successful, longstanding restaurant operators, 58 of which operate multiple restaurants. As of December 31, 2017, our franchisees operated restaurants in 38 DMAs. Of our franchised restaurants, 401 were owned and operated by franchisees that have been with us for more than five years, some of which have developed franchised restaurants as part of multi-unit, multi-year development agreements. In addition, many of our existing franchisees continue to develop restaurants without development agreements. We also support our growth by attracting highly qualified and experienced new franchisees. We will continue to recruit new franchisees who we believe are capable of successful multi-unit development. We believe the revenues generated from our franchise base, including royalty revenues, have historically served as an important source of stable and recurring cash flows to us and, as such, we plan to expand our base of franchised restaurants. We expect franchise development, which may also include refranchising some areas outside of our core North Carolina and South Carolina markets, will continue to lead our expansion efforts.

 Description of Franchise and Development Agreements 
 Our typical agreements for a full-size traditional unit grant a franchisee the right to operate for an initial term of 20 years with additional renewal terms that total 20 years subject to various conditions that include upgrades to the restaurant facility and brand image. Our typical Bojangles Express franchise agreements grant the right to operate for a period of 10 years without renewal so that we can assess at the time of expiration if the market is better served by a full-size replacement. All franchise agreements grant licenses to use the Bojangles trademarks, trade secrets and proprietary methods, recipes and procedures. Our obligations under the franchise agreement include an initial training program, ongoing advice and consultation in connection with operations and management of the restaurants, the development of advertising materials, as well as advice and assistance in local marketing and inspections of a franchisees restaurants. 
 The initial franchise fee for each full-size traditional unit is $25,000, and $15,000 for each Bojangles Express unit. Franchisees are required to pay as royalties 4% of franchise unit sales, except for certain grandfathered units that may pay a lesser percentage and international locations that pay 5%. Franchisees, except for certain grandfathered units that may pay a lesser amount and international locations that are not required to contribute, are also required to pay 1% of franchise unit sales to the Bojangles marketing development fund, to which we also contribute, which creates a pooled fund for the creation of marketing and advertising materials, marketing and media research, marketing promotions and a portion of our marketing employees salaries and expenses. Franchisees are required to sign an advertising co-operative agreement, or the co-op agreement, in connection with their franchise agreements that provides for pooled advertising funds when franchisees share a market with other franchisees or us. Typically, the co-op agreement requires that when an advertising co-operative is activated, franchisees and the company units within the co-operative market must contribute up to 2% of unit sales to the co-operative. Finally, the franchise agreements require that franchisees spend from one to three percent of franchise unit sales on local marketing, depending upon whether an advertising co-operative has been activated in a franchisees market. 
 We often enter into development agreements with new and existing franchisees that provide for planned assigned areas of unit development on a multi-unit, multi-year basis by a franchisee. A development agreement typically provides for the opening of one restaurant per year over a five-year term, but we may grant rights to develop larger numbers of units more quickly, or may shorten the time allowed for development. Moreover, many franchisees develop on a case-by-case submittal basis rather than by formal development agreements. The development fee paid by a franchisee under a development agreement is $5,000 per each assigned unit, and this unit fee is deductible against the franchise fee for each unit developed under the terms of the development agreement. Typically, more than one franchisee and, at times, we may develop in a market to increase the rate of penetration in that market in order to increase consumer awareness and, as a result, the availability of pooled advertising funds in that market. 
 Franchise Owner Support 
 We value our franchisee relationships and provide strong support for their operations and growth initiatives to produce sustainable, long-term success. Our restaurant development team provides consultation regarding site selection and approval processes and our franchise operating team provides consultation in all aspects of operations and preopening preparation. We also have all-star teams to provide assistance for the first two units a franchisee opens. Additionally, we conduct a mandatory management training program, requiring that for at least the first restaurant, a minimum of five of each franchisees operating managers successfully complete a five to seven-week training program prior to opening. The program consists of hands-on training in the operation and management of the restaurant and is conducted by a training manager who has been certified by us. Instructional materials for the initial training include our operations manual, wall charts, job aids, product build charts, ServSafe (food safety) book, videos and other materials we may create from time to time. For the second and subsequent restaurants, franchisees have the option of training their own managers or using our training program without payment of additional fees. 
 
12 


 We also offer support well beyond restaurant opening. We provide ongoing leadership and assistance to the franchisee network through our FBCs who maintain an open dialogue with franchisees on brand initiatives through webinars and quarterly market meetings, and help franchisees to evaluate sales growth and cost initiatives. By continuing to support our franchise network and monitoring local performance, our FBCs help protect our brand. Additionally, we communicate with franchisees on at least a monthly basis, and senior company representatives meet quarterly with our franchise advisory council to discuss system-wide initiatives, share ideas and resolve issues. In addition, we provide local marketing consultation and support, and prepare marketing materials for use by all franchisees in various media including television and radio through the Bojangles marketing development fund. 
 Marketing and Advertising 
 We use multiple marketing channels, including television, radio, print advertising, billboard advertising, internet and social media and loyalty programs to broadly drive brand awareness and traffic to our restaurants. We advertise on local network and cable television in our primary markets, and utilize heavier cable schedules for some of our less developed markets. During fiscal 2017, we and our franchisees were active in television advertising, including cable placement, in approximately 27 DMAs of the 38 DMAs in which our system has restaurants, and we expect to add television advertising in additional DMAs in the future. During fiscal 2017, we and our franchisees utilized radio advertising in approximately 23 radio metro areas. We also sponsor arenas, race tracks, broadcast and sporting events including the Bojangles Coliseum in Charlotte, North Carolina, the Carolina Panthers National Football League team, the Charlotte Hornets National Basketball Association team, the Fox Sports South-Atlanta Braves Television Network, the Atlantic Coast Conference basketball and football and other events and venues. In addition, we are active in various charity and goodwill events and activities, including in-restaurant fundraising, auctions and events for the Muscular Dystrophy Association, Toys for Tots and St. Judes Childrens Hospital. We engage in one on one conversations with our consumers using social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter. We also use social media as a research and customer service tool, and apply insight we gain to future marketing efforts. 
 We promote our restaurants and food through our Its Bo Time advertising campaign, which has become synonymous with our brand. The campaign aims to deliver our message that our products are craveable and that Bojangles is a warm and friendly place to be. All domestic franchisees and the company contribute to the marketing development fund for the development of marketing materials for use in various media, including radio and television commercials, promotions and sponsorships, marketing research as well as the cost of administration of the marketing development fund. The company administers and may require franchisees participation in advertising co-operatives with other franchisees and the company to increase advertising levels based in pooled media advertising. 
 Purchasing and Distribution 
 Maintaining a high degree of quality in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers. We regularly inspect vendors to ensure that products purchased conform to our standards and that prices offered are competitive. Our Quality Assurance Department works with our suppliers to obtain third-party audits. We negotiate terms, conditions and pricing directly with all suppliers of food and packaging. We contract with our foodservice distributor for the distribution of all of our food and most of our supplies delivered to our restaurants. 
 In September 2015, we entered into a Master Distribution Agreement with McLane Foodservice, Inc. (McLane), pursuant to which McLane was appointed as an approved distributor for substantially all of the items used in our stores. We transitioned to McLane from our prior approved distributor during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Our agreement with McLane extends through March 31, 2023 and generally restricts us from using alternative distributors for most products. McLane delivers frozen, refrigerated and dry products, as well as most of our restaurant supplies, to most of our restaurants at least two times per week. We contract with four 
 
13 


  primary suppliers for our bone-in chicken, which is supplied to our company-operated restaurants by McLane. Our franchisees are required to use an approved distributor and approved manufacturers for the purchase of their food and supplies. Certain of our franchisees have elected to transition to bone-in chicken distribution through McLane. If quality standards can be met, those franchisees that have not transitioned to bone-in chicken distribution through McLane can continue to receive deliveries from other approved chicken distributors. 
 In our normal course of business, we evaluate bids from multiple suppliers for various products. Poultry and other proteins are our largest product cost items and represented approximately 45% of company-operated food and supplies costs in fiscal 2017. Fluctuations in supply and prices can significantly impact our restaurant service and profit performance. We actively manage cost volatility for poultry by negotiating directly with multiple suppliers, purchasing from suppliers with what we believe are the most favorable terms given existing market conditions. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We have registered Bojangles® and certain other names used by our restaurants as trademarks or service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Bojangles® trademark is also registered in some form in approximately 25 foreign countries. Our current brand campaign tag line, Its Bo Time®, has also been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We also have registered the configuration of our Big Bo Box as a trademark, and we continue to expand the family of Bojangles related trademarks. In addition, the Bojangles logo, website name and address and Facebook and Twitter accounts are our intellectual property. Our policy is to pursue and maintain registration of service marks and trademarks in those countries where permitted and where business strategy requires us to do so and to oppose vigorously any infringement or dilution of the service marks or trademarks. We or our suppliers maintain the seasonings and additives for our chicken and biscuits, and our other products, as well as certain standards, specifications and operating procedures, as trade secrets or confidential information. 
Competition 
 We operate in the limited service restaurant industry, which is highly competitive and fragmented. The number, size and strength of competitors vary by region. Our competition includes a variety of locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains that offer dine-in, carry-out and delivery services. Our competition in the broadest perspective includes restaurants, convenience food stores, delicatessens, supermarkets and club stores. However, more specifically, we compete with fast-casual restaurants, such as Chipotle and Panera Bread Company, quick-service restaurants who serve breakfast, such as McDonalds and Hardees, and chicken-specialty and Cajun quick-service restaurants, such as Chick-fil-A, Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen and Zaxbys. 
 We believe competition within the fast-casual restaurant segment is based primarily on fresh ingredients and preparation of food, quality, taste, service and ambience. We also believe that QSR competition is based primarily on value, speed of service, convenience of drive-thru service, brand recognition and restaurant location. In addition, we compete with franchisors of other restaurant concepts for prospective franchisees. 
Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including regulation of discharges into the air and water, storage and disposal of waste and clean-up of contaminated soil and groundwater. Under various federal, state and local laws, an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, in or emanating from such property. Such liability may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances, and in some cases we may have obligations imposed by indemnity provisions in our leases. 
 
14 


 We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of our properties, although for new company development, a Phase I environmental review is typically completed, and when advisable, a Phase II review, prior to our undertaking a long-term lease. No assurance can be given that we have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties or that such liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. 
 Regulation and Compliance 
 We are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulation, including those relating to, among others, public health and safety, zoning and fire codes, and franchising. Failure to obtain or retain food or other licenses and registrations or exemptions would adversely affect the operations of restaurants, or the ability to franchise. Although we have not experienced and do not anticipate any significant problems in obtaining required licenses, permits or approvals, any difficulties, delays or failures in obtaining such licenses, permits, registrations, exemptions, or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of, or adversely impact the viability of, a restaurant in a particular area. 
 The development and construction of additional restaurants will be subject to compliance with applicable regulations, including those relating to zoning, land use, water quality and retention, and environment. 
 We believe federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material effect on operations, but more stringent and varied requirements of local government bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors, among others, could delay construction and increase development costs for new restaurants. 
 We are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and various federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages, exempt versus non-exempt, overtime, unemployment tax rates, workers compensation rates, citizenship requirements and other working conditions. A significant portion of the hourly staff is paid at rates consistent with the applicable federal or state minimum wage and, accordingly, increases in the minimum wage and/or changes in exempt versus non-exempt status will increase labor costs. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) increased medical costs beginning in fiscal 2015 and we expect further increases in subsequent years. We are also subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment, which may require us to design or modify our restaurants to make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons. 
 For a discussion of the various risks we face from regulation and compliance matters, see Risk Factors. 
 Management Information Systems 
 All of our company-operated restaurants use computerized point-of-sale and back office systems, which we believe are scalable to support our long-term growth plans. The point-of-sale system provides a touch screen interface and integrated, high speed credit card, mobile payment, and gift card processing, as well as the ability to interact with our customer loyalty program. The point-of-sale system is used to collect daily transaction data from company-operated restaurants, which generates information about product mix and daily sales that we actively analyze. During fiscal 2015, we completed migrating our company-operated restaurants to a new point-of-sale system and during the post-transition there may be a period of time during which the transactional data for the restaurants that migrated to the new point-of-sale system is in a format that is not easily usable for analytical purposes. 
 Our in-restaurant back office computer system is designed to assist in the management of our restaurants and provide labor and food cost management tools. The system also provides our support center and restaurant operations management quick access to detailed business data and reduces the time our restaurant managers spend on administrative needs. The system also provides sales, bank deposit and variance data to our finance 
 
15 


  department on a daily basis. For company-operated restaurants, we use this data to generate daily, weekly and/or period reports regarding sales and other key measures. The XPIENT point-of-sale and back office systems are available for use in franchised restaurants, but there are other systems currently in use and otherwise available that may be used by franchisees. 
 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we introduced the Bojangles Mobile App. Once downloaded, customers can use the Bojangles Mobile App to explore our menu, locate the nearest Bojangles restaurant, pay for their purchase at the register using a pre-loaded balance in their Bojangles Wallet and earn rewards under our Bo Rewards customer loyalty program, which are redeemable for free Bojangles food. Although the Bojangles Wallet feature and our Bo Rewards customer loyalty program are currently only available for use at our company-operated restaurants, we are collaborating with our franchisees to facilitate their adoption of the Bojangles Wallet and our Bo Rewards customer loyalty program. In addition, we are targeting fiscal 2018 for the roll out of the next phase of our the Bojangles Mobile App launch, which we expect to include mobile ordering from a limited menu of select Bojangles favorites, like our Big Bo Boxes for tailgating and large catering events. 
 Geographic Footprint 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 325 domestic company-operated restaurants and 436 domestic franchised restaurants located in eleven states, including North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, West Virginia, Florida, Maryland and Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia. In addition, we currently have three international franchised restaurants in Roatan Island, Honduras. International stores represented less than 1% of our revenues in each of fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 9,900 employees, of whom approximately 9,650 were restaurant employees and approximately 250 were support center personnel. None of our employees are part of a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationships with our employees are satisfactory. 
Seasonality 
 Seasonal factors cause our revenues to fluctuate from fiscal quarter to fiscal quarter. Our revenues per restaurant are typically lower in the first fiscal quarter. As a result, our quarterly and annual operating results and key performance indicators may fluctuate significantly.
