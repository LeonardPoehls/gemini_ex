Item 1. Business 
 
Founded in 1974, HMS is a leading provider of cost containment solutions in the U.S. healthcare marketplace. We use innovative technology, extensive data services and powerful analytics, to deliver coordination of benefits, payment integrity and care management and consumer engagement solutions to help healthcare payers improve financial performance and clinical outcomes. We provide coordination of benefits services to government and commercial healthcare payers and sponsors to ensure that the responsible party pays healthcare claims. Our payment integrity services ensure healthcare claims billed are accurate and appropriate, and our care management and consumer engagement technology helps risk-bearing organizations to better engage with and manage the care delivered to their members. Together these various services help customers recover erroneously paid amounts from liable third parties; prevent future improper payments; reduce fraud, waste and abuse; better manage the care their members receive; engage healthcare consumers to improve clinical outcomes while increasing member satisfaction and retention; and achieve regulatory compliance. We currently operate as one business segment with a single management team that reports to the Chief Executive Officer.
 
HMS began its operations as Health Management Systems, Inc., which became our wholly owned subsidiary in March 2003 when we assumed its business in connection with the adoption of a holding company structure. In recent years HMS has grown both organically and through targeted acquisitions of businesses that helped expand our product suite, including IntegriGuard, LLC (2009), HealthDataInsights, Inc.(“HDI”) (2011), Essette, Inc. (“Essette”) (2016), Eliza Holding Corp. (“Eliza”) (2017) and others. The acquisitions of Essette and Eliza significantly expanded the breadth of solutions we offer entities taking risk, creating a new care management and consumer engagement vertical for HMS.
 
We were originally incorporated in the State of New York in October 2002 and reincorporated in the State of Delaware in July 2013. Our principal executive offices are located at 5615 High Point Drive, Irving, Texas 75038, and our telephone number is (214) 453-3000. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 2,500 employees. Additional information about HMS is available on our website at www.hms.com.

Our Solutions
 
Our services are applicable to federal, state and commercial health plans and other healthcare entities taking payment risk. Our coordination of benefits and payment integrity services are designed to address errors across the payment continuum, beginning with an individual’s enrollment in a program before any medical service is rendered, to pre-payment review of a claim by a payer, through recovery where identification of an improper payment is made via audit. Our services address a wide spectrum of payment errors, including eligibility and coordination of benefits errors, the identification and investigation of potential fraud, and determinations that claim amounts paid were improper and our services extend to most claim types. Our care management and consumer engagement services also assist customers in managing quality, risk, cost and compliance across all lines of business. As a result of these services, customers received billions of dollars in cash recoveries in 2017, and saved billions more through the prevention of erroneous payments, improved clinical outcomes for their members, and reduced enrollment turnover.
 

In general, our range of products and services include the following:
 
COB SERVICES 
 
Coordination of Benefits 
 Our coordination of benefits services are provided primarily for state governments and Medicaid managed care plans and draw principally upon proprietary information management and data mining techniques designed to ensure that the correct party pays a healthcare claim. We offer cost avoidance services, which include providing validated insurance coverage information that is used by payers to coordinate benefits properly for future claims. With validated insurance information, Medicaid payers can avoid unnecessary costs by ensuring that they pay only after all other insurance coverage available has been exhausted, thereby complying with federal regulations that require Medicaid to be the payer of last resort. Nevertheless, due to a variety of factors, some Medicaid claims are paid even when there is a known responsible third party. Our government-sponsored program customers rely on us to identify those claims that were paid in error and recover these payments from the liable third party. Further, we also provide services to assist customers in identifying other third-party insurance and recovering medical expenses where a member is involved in a casualty or tort incident. Lastly, for Medicaid agencies exclusively, we provide estate recovery services to identify and recover Medicaid expenditures from the estates of deceased Medicaid members in accordance with state policies. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our coordination of benefit services represented 73.4%, 72.2% and 71.2% of our total revenue, respectively.

ANALYTICAL SERVICES 
 
Payment Integrity 
 Our payment integrity services are designed to ensure that healthcare payments are accurate and appropriate. These services are applicable to all customers that HMS serves, including federal and state governments, commercial health plans and other at-risk entities. Our solutions are designed to verify that medical services are utilized, billed and paid appropriately. We combine data analytics, clinical expertise and proprietary algorithms and technology to identify improper payments on both a pre-payment and post-payment basis; identify and recover overpayments/underpayments; detect and prevent fraud, waste and abuse; and identify process improvements. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our payment integrity services represented 20.0%, 27.6% and 28.8% of our total revenue, respectively.
Care Management and Consumer Engagement 
 Our care management and consumer engagement solutions help our customers manage the care delivered to their members with a focus on improving clinical outcomes and patient engagement. We offer a broad foundation of technology and service solutions to support a health engagement management framework, which enable health plans and other risk-bearing entities to better manage costs and clinical outcomes and improve their member experience. Our care management and consumer engagement vertical leverages HMS data and analytics with a combination of Essette and Eliza solutions currently aimed at care management, risk management and member engagement in order to provide customers with a tailored, integrated platform that addresses core healthcare industry challenges on an enterprise scale. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our care management and consumer engagement services represented 6.6% and 0.2%, of our total revenue, respectively.
Intellectual Property
 
Our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others are important to our business and competitive position. We establish and protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property through a combination of patents, patent applications, trademarks, copyrights, domain names, and trade secrets, including know-how, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, security measures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, and other contractual rights.
 
We own a number of patents and trademarks that are important to HMS. As of December 31, 2017, our patent portfolio is comprised of approximately 50 domestic and international patents, and we are currently pursuing numerous patent applications in the United States and around the world. We have a number of registered trademarks, including HMS®, and the corresponding HMS + logo design mark, HMS IntegritySource®, Eliza®, Essette® and other registered and common law trademarks. We also hold copyrights relating to certain aspects of our products and services. While we consider all of these proprietary rights important in the operation of our business, we do not believe any one individual technology is essential to our business.
 
Customers
 
We provide our solutions to customers across a broad range of entities within the healthcare industry, including health plans, state agencies, federal programs, private employers and other at-risk providers. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our total revenue was $521.2 million, $489.7 million and $474.2 million, respectively. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue during any period presented.
 
The composition of our 10 largest customers changes periodically. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our 10 largest customers represented 39.5%, 40.6% and 44.0% of our total revenue, respectively. The current terms of our agreements with these customers have expiration dates ranging between 2018 and 2023. Several of our contracts, including those with some of our largest customers, may be terminated for convenience. The early termination of a contract with one of our significant customers may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We provide products and services under contracts (or subcontracts) that contain various revenue structures, including contingent revenue and to a lesser extent fixed-fee arrangements. Many of our state government contracts have terms ranging from three to five years, including renewal terms at the option of the customer. In many instances, we provide our services pursuant to agreements that are subject to periodic reprocurements. Because we provide our services pursuant to agreements that are open to competition from various businesses in the U.S. healthcare insurance benefit cost containment arena, we cannot provide assurance that our contracts, including those with our largest customers, will not be terminated for convenience, awarded to other parties, or renewed. Additionally, we cannot provide assurance that our contracts, if renewed, will have the same fee structures or otherwise be on satisfactory terms.
 
Industry Trends and Opportunities
 
U.S. healthcare expenditures continue to escalate and consume a large proportion of the U.S. GDP, presenting challenges for payers who wish to contain and reduce costs while also promoting quality healthcare outcomes. These aims are the same across all at-risk entities, including commercial health plans and government healthcare programs, such as Medicaid and Medicare.
 
Within the commercial market, health plans sell policies directly to individuals (on the open market or via health insurance exchanges), contract with employers to underwrite their employees’ care, or contract with self-insured employers to oversee benefit administration to their employees. This market also includes a growing number of risk bearing provider-sponsored plans that operate and market health plan benefits. According to CMS NHE projections, private health insurance covered approximately 200.1 million individuals at a cost of $1.2 trillion in 2017.
 
Several commercial health plans also offer government-sponsored lines of business, including partnering with Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP to oversee care delivery for beneficiaries enrolled in those programs. Government managed care grew out of pressures to contain the growth of state and federal program spending and to address general concerns about healthcare access. In most states, managed care is currently the predominant delivery system for Medicaid. As of July 2017, all states except three had some form of managed care in place, including the District of Columbia. Among the 39 Medicaid programs (38 states plus the District of Columbia) with comprehensive risk-based MCOs, 29 states reported that 75% or more of their Medicaid beneficiaries were enrolled in MCOs as of July 1, 2017. More states continue to carve-out complex populations as well as behavioral health services into MCO contracts. Of the 32 Medicaid programs (31 states plus the District of Columbia) that opted to expand Medicaid eligibility levels pursuant to the ACA, 27 states were using MCOs to cover newly eligible adults as of July, 2017. Of those 27 states, 24 states covered more than 75% of beneficiaries in this group through risk-based managed care. It is unclear at this time how, if at all, efforts in Congress to “repeal and replace” the ACA could affect any of the state expansions or potential future growth of Medicaid lives and expenditures. As Congress continues to debate proposals to repeal major portions of the ACA, including the ACA’s Marketplace and Medicaid coverage expansions, as well as other proposals to fundamentally restructure Medicaid’s financing structure, the implications of these proposals remain unclear.
 
Similarly, managed care health plans also continue to assume risk for Medicare lives, with the Kaiser Family Foundation estimating that 33% of all Medicare beneficiaries, or 19.0 million lives, were enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan in 2017. HMS also continues to serve government-sponsored agencies’ legacy fee-for-service programs at the state and federal level. These plans are generally reliant on and susceptible to the government appropriations process that determines their budget and governs the number of beneficiaries they serve.
 
According to the CMS NHE projections, Medicare programs in 2017 covered approximately 57.7 million people at a cost of approximately $718.7 billion and Medicaid/CHIP covered approximately 79.9 million people, costing approximately $604.1 billion. Altogether, it is projected that the government programs we serve covered approximately 137.6 million people at a total cost of approximately $1.32 trillion in 2017.
 
CMS projects Medicaid spending and enrollment will grow 6.0% and 1.7%, respectively in 2018 over 2017. CHIP spending is expected to grow 6.7% in 2018 over 2017, and CHIP enrollment is expected to increase 3.5% in 2018 over 2017. As commercial and government health plans continue to focus on strategies to contain costs across their different lines of business, we will continue to focus on serving them and meeting their evolving needs. Regardless of the program, coordinating benefits among a growing number of healthcare payers and ensuring that claims are paid appropriately represents an enormous challenge for our customers and an ongoing opportunity for us.

Regulatory Environment
 
The market for cost containment solutions is large and growing, driven by increasing healthcare costs and payment complexities. For 2018, Medicare and Medicaid are projected to pay approximately 45.3% of the nation’s healthcare expenditures and serve over 140.7 million beneficiaries. Many of these beneficiaries are enrolled in managed care plans, which have the responsibility for both patient care and claim adjudications. Since 1985, we have provided state Medicaid agencies with services to identify third parties with primary liability for Medicaid claims, and since 2005, we have provided similar services to Medicaid managed care plans.
 
In 2006, Congress enacted the DRA and created the Medicaid Integrity Program under the Social Security Act to increase the government’s capacity to prevent, detect and address fraud, waste and abuse in the Medicaid program. Later that year, Congress passed the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, which established the Medicare RAC program. HDI was awarded one of the first contracts under the program. In October 2016, CMS made a new round of awards and we again were awarded a region. These measures, at both the federal and state level, have strengthened our ability to identify and recover erroneous payments on behalf of our customers.
 
The ACA was signed into law in 2010. It included many provisions impacting healthcare delivery and payment programs, including employer-sponsored health coverage, expansion of the Medicaid program, health insurance exchanges with premium subsidies, and payment integrity efforts. In 2017, Congress considered the revision or repeal of some or all of the ACA. Options that have been considered include issuing block grants or establishing per capita caps for state Medicaid populations, and looking at program design alternatives for future enrollment criteria. We will monitor ACA-related changes as they develop and assess their potential impact, as well as any opportunities they may present for our customers and for us.
 
Competition
 
The U.S. healthcare insurance benefit cost containment marketplace is a dynamic industry with a range of businesses currently able to offer cost containment services, both directly or indirectly (through subcontracting), to some or all of the various healthcare payers. In addition, with improvements in technology and the growth in healthcare spending, new businesses are incentivized to enter this marketplace. Many healthcare payers also have the ability to perform some or all of these cost containment services themselves and choose to exercise that option. Competition is therefore robust as customers have many alternatives available to them in their effort to contain healthcare costs.
 
We compete based on a variety of factors, including our ability to perform a wide range of coordination of benefits and payment integrity related functions; proven results to maximize recoveries and cost avoidance; our in-depth government healthcare program experience; clinical staff expertise; extensive insurance eligibility database; proprietary systems and processes; existing relationships with various customers and other industry stakeholders; and our ability to provide customers with actionable intelligence to improve clinical outcomes and patient engagement.
 
Within our core coordination of benefits services, we compete primarily with large business outsourcing and technology firms, claims processors and PBMs, clearinghouses, healthcare consulting firms, smaller regional vendors and other TPL service providers. In addition, we frequently work with customers who may elect to perform some or all of their recovery and cost avoidance functions in-house. The competitive environment for payment integrity services includes some of the same companies that provide coordination of benefits services. Within the care management and risk analytics sector, we compete primarily with vendors who provide these and other population health management technology services. Companies with whom we compete across our product offerings include:
 

§ Accenture | § Cotiviti Corporation | § Inovalon | § SCIO Health Analytics 
-----------------------------------------+------------------------------+----------------------------+------------------------------
§ CaseNet | § Equian, LLC | § LexisNexis | § Verscend Technologies, Inc.

Business Strategy
 
We believe that the steadily increasing enrollment and rising expenditures for Medicare and Medicaid, with most new enrollees entering managed care plans; an aging U.S. population with an increasing concentration of individuals with high cost chronic conditions and often co-morbidities; and the overall complexity of the healthcare claims payment system in the U.S. all combine to create substantial growth opportunities for the suite of cost containment solutions we offer.
 

We also believe these factors present growth opportunities for our care management and consumer engagement solutions. We expect to grow our business over the course of 2018 and beyond, both organically and inorganically, by leveraging existing key assets (e.g., our data, analytics, in-house expertise, and distribution channel) and pursuing a number of strategic objectives or initiatives, including:
 

§ | Expanding the scope of our relationship with existing customers – by selling additional products and services, including those designed to improve member engagement and improve clinical outcomes.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Adding new customers – by marketing to commercial health plans, including Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage plans, at-risk group and individual health lines of business and ASO; government healthcare payers, including Medicaid agencies, state employee health benefit plans and CHIP; at-risk provider organizations and ACOs; and commercial employers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Introducing new “homegrown” products and services – through internal development initiatives designed to enhance or expand our existing suite of cost containment solutions.

§ | Promoting automation and innovation to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our services – by continuing to implement new technology and process improvements designed to increase recovery yields, increase customer satisfaction, and achieve greater operating efficiencies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Building out our new care management and consumer engagement technology platform – by continuing to grow a broad foundation of technology and service solutions to help customers better manage quality, cost and compliance across all lines of business. Our first steps in this strategy were the acquisition of Essette and Eliza. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Prudent deployment of capital – by investing in internal growth initiatives; selectively investing in capabilities, technologies, and assets to complement our core cost-containment expertise; building care management and care coordination adjacencies to complement the Essette and Eliza acquisitions; and expanding our data analytics capabilities. Our focus may include acquisitions that represent long-term growth potential, target high-growth areas, are accretive to earnings, and fill a strategic need in our business portfolio as we seek to provide increasingly comprehensive solutions to our customers. We may also repurchase our shares, pursuant to a two-year $50 million authority granted by our Board of Directors in November 2017.
