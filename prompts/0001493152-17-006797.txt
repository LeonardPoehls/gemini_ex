ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General
 
Command Security Corporation (the “Company,” or “we”) was incorporated in New York in 1980 and principally provides uniformed security officers and aviation security services to commercial, financial, industrial, aviation and governmental customers throughout the United States. We provide our security services to our customers through Command Security, our security division, and our aviation security services through our Aviation Safeguards division.


Command Security provides security services to governmental, quasi-governmental and financial institutions, healthcare facilities, colleges and universities, residential communities, commercial real estate, industrial, distribution, logistics and retail customers. Our security services include providing armed and unarmed uniformed security personnel for access control, loss prevention, mobile patrols, traffic control, security console/system operators and fire safety directors, as well as providing personnel for reception, concierge and front desk/doorman operations. The security services division generated approximately $103.6 million, or 64% of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.
 
Aviation Safeguards provides aviation security and passenger assistance services to approximately 80 domestic and international airlines, airports, airport authorities and the general aviation community at approximately nine international airports. Our aviation security division provides a variety of uniformed services for domestic and international air carriers, including security for airlines, aircraft, passengers and cargo, baggage screening, wheelchair escort services, special escort services and skycap services. The aviation services division generated approximately $58.6 million, or 36% of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.
 
In June 2016, the Company commenced work on the U.S. Postal Service (“USPS”) contract that had been delayed for over 15 months due to legal protests challenging the original award decision. This marks the start of a federal government line of business which eventually could include the Department of Homeland Security/Transportation Security Administration Screening Services Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract award, Departments of Defense, Justice and State.


In 2014, the Company made a 20% minority investment in Ocean Protection Services LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“OPS LLC”), who holds a 30% interest in an entity that specializes in maritime security, risk management and risk analysis. The Company purchased 2,000 Class A Common Units of OPS LLC for a purchase price of $2.125 million and funded the purchase price through borrowings under the Company’s existing line of credit. The excess of the carrying value of the Company’s investment in OPS LLC and the Company’s proportionate share of the net assets of OPS Acquisitions Ltd. (“OPSA”) and OPS LLC is largely attributable to goodwill. Since the Company’s initial investment, there have been no additional capital contributions made or distributions received.
 
In September 2016, the majority owner of OPS LLC consented to a restructuring transaction wherein 70% of its investment in OPSA was transferred to a group comprising former management and owners of OPS LLC and the holder of the debt of OPSA. Also pursuant to this transaction, the majority owner of OPS LLC transferred its 80% interest in OPS LLC to the Company for no consideration resulting in OPS LLC becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.


Operations
 
As a licensed security company, our security services division deploys security officers to protect people and property; prevent the theft of property; and deter, observe, detect and report security threats for our customers. We conduct our security services principally by providing security officers and other personnel who are, depending on the particular customer requirements, uniformed or plain-clothed, armed or unarmed. Based on the customer requirements and/or our internal threat assessment, our security officers patrol in marked vehicles with radio communications; stand duty on the customer premises at stationary posts such as points of access, reception areas or surveillance monitors, and/or conduct foot patrols around the customer perimeter and other high-value areas. Our security officers maintain contact with their headquarters or supervisors via car radio, hand-held radios or cell phones. In addition to the more traditional tasks associated with access control and loss prevention, our security officers respond to and report emergency situations such as fires, natural disasters, work accidents and medical crises to the appropriate authorities. We provide security officer services to many of our customers, 24-hours per day and 365 days per year. Our security officers are deployed to provide facility security, access control, personnel security checks, traffic and parking control and to protect against fire, theft, sabotage and safety hazards. We also provide specialized vehicle patrol and inspection services as well as technical products such as access control, video monitoring and other devices through distribution arrangements. Our aviation services division provides a variety of uniformed personnel for security including aircraft and cargo security, access control, wheelchair and passenger escorts, skycaps and baggage handlers for domestic and international air carriers. Since September 11, 2001, the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration have implemented numerous security measures that affect airline operations, including expanded cargo and baggage screening, and may implement additional measures in the future. Additional measures taken to enhance either passenger or cargo security procedures in the future may increase the airline industry’s demand for third party services provided by us.
 
To better integrate and manage our business, our operations are divided into General Security, Aviation Services and National Accounts. Each of these divisions is managed by a vice president/program manager who is responsible for developing and executing our business plan based on the demand, needs and competition in each of our specific markets. The division vice presidents and program managers are assisted by district managers who are responsible for local implementation of policies and procedures. While each divisional business plan is based on our overall corporate strategy, the primary mission of our divisional vice presidents is to staff, train and deploy their teams to provide the necessary physical security and customer service solutions in a responsive fashion consistent with customer service expectations. They also are expected to manage the growth and profitability of their division’s operations. We have approximately 23 offices and operate directly or through subcontractors throughout the United States, including in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. We frequently establish offices close to our customers and delegate responsibility to our local managers to satisfy customer expectations. Our managers maintain ongoing relationships and contact with our customers in order to promptly and effectively anticipate and respond to the needs of customers and security officers. Our managers play an important role in maintaining service quality and assisting with sales and marketing efforts. Our sales and marketing efforts focus on customers located primarily in urban centers and other concentrated business districts in major metropolitan areas and select suburban areas with a high density of businesses.

We generally render our security services pursuant to a standard form security services agreement that specifies the personnel and/or equipment to be provided by us at one or more designated locations and the applicable payment rates, which typically are hourly rates per person. Our rates vary depending on whether our services are provided during normal business hours, overtime or during holidays, as well as the length of time for which we are being engaged. Our security services incorporate certain management functions, including threat assessments, personnel scheduling, compensation, outfitting, equipment, training and supervision. These security services agreements also provide our customers with flexibility by permitting reductions or expansions of the security force on relatively short notice by our customers. We are responsible for preventing the interruption of security services as a consequence of illness, vacations or resignations of our security officers.
 
To determine whether adequate security requirements have been established prior to commencing service for a customer, we conduct a threat assessment of the customer’s site and prepare recommended changes to existing customer security programs or services. While we prepare site assessments and issue recommendations, the security plan and coverage levels are ultimately determined by our customers.
 
We are increasingly dependent on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations across the country and between our personnel and our customers and suppliers. Based on the level of contracted services, we use sophisticated electronic security and access control equipment, including computerized systems, video surveillance equipment and electronic accountability technology to monitor and log security officer patrols and generate user-friendly reports for customer and internal use.
 
We use technology to support efficiency, accuracy, and dependability in our administrative functions including finance and accounting. In addition, labor and operations management services such as scheduling, reporting, payroll, billing and training management are integrated through a third party vendor software platform.
 
Employee Recruitment and Training
 
We believe that the high quality of our security officers is essential to our ability to offer effective and reliable services to our customers. We encourage the retention of our security officers and seek to control our operating costs through effective management of the hiring process, including extensive candidate screening, training and development. We require all applicants for security officer positions to undergo a detailed pre-employment interview and a background investigation covering such areas as past employment, education, military service and, subject to applicable state laws, criminal and other background searches. Employees are selected based on a number of criteria including physical fitness, maturity, experience, personality, perceived stability and reliability, among others. We frequently conduct medical examinations and substance abuse testing on potential candidates, subject to applicable laws and regulations. Our security officers and other personnel supplied to our customers are employees of our company, even though they may be stationed regularly at our customer’s facilities.
 
We are committed to providing staff that not only meet all state and federal requirements for training, but also our own rigorous standards in specialized areas including: terrorism response, CPR, first-aid, fire safety, crowd and riot control, media interaction, public relations, crisis management and emergency situations. Additionally, we provide our employees with site-specific training to meet the needs of individual industries, facilities and customers.
 
We are an equal opportunity employer and make all employment-related decisions without regard to race, creed, color, national origin, sex, age, disability, marital status or sexual orientation.
 
Significant Customers
 
We rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, the Company had six customers, who represented approximately 52% of the Company’s total revenue in the aggregate. Two of these customers each represented 13% of total revenue. These customers include one domestic and one international airline, the U.S. Postal Service (“USPS”), a transportation company, an online retailer and web services provider and a northeast U.S. based healthcare facility. While the Company’s cost structure is highly variable and largely identifiable to the delivery of services for any specific contract, a loss of business with one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
See “Notes to Financial Statements—Note 11 Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customer.”
 
Competition
 
The contract security officer segment of the security services business is highly competitive, labor intensive and substantially affected by the cost of labor and by the availability of qualified personnel. Our ability to provide the required number of competent, trained personnel in a timely manner is critical to retaining our business, containing payroll costs and avoiding undue insurance exposure. To meet these goals, we strive to successfully manage our human resource needs through manpower planning, quality control and risk management, while focusing on financial management and effective sales and marketing strategies.
 
Although most of our contracts may be terminated by us or by our customers at our or their discretion, we minimize customer attrition by adhering to basic performance standards in meeting essential customer requirements.

We believe that a customer’s selection of a company to provide security services is based primarily on price, quality of services provided, scope of services performed, name recognition, recruiting, training, the extent and quality of security officer supervision and the ability to handle multiple worksites on a nationwide basis. It has become more common for our customers to select security service providers through competitive bid processes intended to procure quality services at lower prices. Some of our competitors may be willing to provide services at lower prices, accept a lower profit margin, or expend more capital in order to obtain or retain business. As we have expanded our operations, we have had to compete more frequently against larger national companies, such as Securitas North America, G4S Secure Solutions (USA) and Allied Universal, all which have substantially greater financial and other resources, personnel and facilities than us. These competitors also offer a range of security and investigative services that are at least as extensive as, and directly competitive with, the services that we offer. In addition, we compete with many regional and local organizations that offer substantially all of the services that we offer to our customers and that may have better knowledge of the local conditions in their regions and increased local visibility, which may provide such companies with a competitive edge. Our management believes that we have been able to successfully compete on the basis of the quality of our services, our professional relationships and our reputation. Particularly with respect to certain of our markets, management believes we enjoy a favorable competitive position because of our emphasis on responsive customer service, supervision and training. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to effectively compete with other companies, particularly those having greater financial and other resources, personnel and facilities. See “Risk Factors—Competition.”
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to a large number of city, county and state firearm, occupational licensing laws and regulations and prevailing wage requirements that apply to many of our employees including security officers and private investigators. In addition, many states have laws requiring training and registration of security officers, regulating the use of badges and uniforms, prescribing the use of identification cards or badges, and imposing minimum bond, surety or insurance standards. As required, we are licensed to provide private security services in each of the states in which we do business. We may incur penalties and fines as the result of our failure to comply with these laws and regulations including licensing irregularities or the misconduct of security officers from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. However, our management believes we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. See “Risk Factors—Regulation.”
Employees
 
Our business is labor intensive and is consequently affected by the availability of qualified personnel and the cost of labor. Although the security services industry is characterized by high turnover, we have not experienced any material difficulty in hiring qualified security officers. In some cases, when labor has been in short supply, we have been required to pay higher wages and/or incur overtime charges. As of March 31, 2017, we had approximately 5,200 total employees including 4,300 full-time employees, the majority of whom are hourly service workers, and approximately 225 of whom serve as managers, administrative employees and executives in our 23 offices nationwide.
 
Approximately 59% of our workforce is not subject to collective bargaining agreements. The remaining 41% of our workforce, including in particular, a number of employees based in our New York City security services office and at our airport offices at John F. Kennedy International and LaGuardia airports are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Three of the agreements, covering approximately 19% of our employees, expired on October 31, 2016, February 28, 2017 and March 31, 2017. We are currently involved in negotiations to renew the expired agreements. One other collective bargaining agreement, covering approximately 2% of our employees, is set to expire in June 2017. The remaining seven agreements, covering approximately 21% of our employees, are set to expire in September 2018 and thereafter.


We have employment agreements with certain of our officers and key employees with varying terms. The agreements generally provide for annual salaries and for salary continuation for a specified number of months under certain circumstances, including a change in control of the Company.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We own the service marks “Command Security Corporation” and “CSC” for security officer, detective, private investigation services and security consulting services.
 
In July 2016, we were granted word mark/service mark protection by the United States Patent and Trademark Office for “CommandTrack” and “CommandTrack-Air,” which encompass tracking of security officers and personnel, as well as location and monitoring services for small vehicles such as carts and wheelchairs.
