ITEM 1. BUSINESS
History
 
Our company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 7, 2007. From incorporation until 2009 we were a distributor of an electronic non-invasive acupuncture pen as an alternative to traditional needles used during acupuncture treatments. We did not generate revenues from sale of the acupuncture pen and, upon further market research, it was determined that pursuing the marketing and sale of this product was not as profitable as previously projected. Therefore, all efforts relating to the distribution and marketing of the acupuncture pen ceased.  In 2009, the Company entered the business of marketing certain energy conversion and waste disposal pyrolysis technology and systems.   This business was discontinued by March 2011.
Previous Business
 
On October 30, 2012, we completed the incorporation and registration of Unwall Technologies Holdings SDN.BHD, a wholly-owned Malaysian subsidiary (“Unwall Technologies”), which commenced operations to offer mobile apps through its former website, www.uwii.org . The Company planned to introduce applications for mobile devices in the first half of 2013 and web applications later in the year. This venture was discontinued May 31, 2013 and the business closed by August 31, 2013. The subsidiary does still exist with no assets or liabilities remaining.

Development began on a web based social lending division. So far, this business has not proceeded beyond initial plans for a joint venture and, as a result the Company has reverted to shell company status.
 
On January 15, 2016, we announced a marketing and distribution agreement with Rich Group concerning the marketing of Eastern alternative medical packages related to Type II Diabetes outside China to non-traditional markets where permitted by applicable law.
 
On July 9, 2015 we changed our corporate name to “3 Shine Technologies Inc.” and, on September 14, 2015, we again changed our corporate name, this time to our present corporate name, “Rorine International Holding Corporation.”  Both of these corporation name changes were accomplished by means of a merger with a wholly owned subsidiary, as permitted by Nevada corporation law.
 
Current Business
 
On the 12 January 2016, Rorine International Holding Corporation Inc entered in a marketing and distribution agreement with RICH Group based in South East Asia. The agreement was negotiated and announced by Rorine’s Chief Financial Officer Mr Tan Sew. According to Mr Tan this agreement took several months to plan and negotiate and “will give Rorine an excellent opportunity to market Eastern alternative medical packages related to Type II Diabetes outside of China to non-traditional markets such as in the West.”
 
The agreement was signed between Rorine International Holding Corporation and RICH Group who had previously acquired Guangzhou Huanai Nutrition and Health Information Co. Ltd and Guangzhou Tongde Hospital. One of RICH Group’s diversified investment holdings has been in alternative medicine & treatment for Type II Diabetes, specifically in China where roughly 10% of the population is susceptible to it. They have a non-invasive treatment program based on the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and modern hyperthermia, elemental balance therapy, psychotherapy, resulting in complete restoration to normal health and diet. They currently have a separate marketing and distribution company specifically for the China market. This new agreement allows them to move outside of China into new and growing markets specifically targeting western patients.
 
According to this agreement, Rorine will setup and prepare a marketing strategy and platform as well as liaise with hospitals, clinics and associations in order to bring this unique product to markets in the West where Diabetes is also on the rise.
 
The agreement is part of a long term strategy initiated by the Board of Directors of Rorine International Holding Corporation, faithfully guided by its Chief Officer Mr Tesheb Casimir. Part of this turn around occurred when the Board decided to appoint Mr Tan Sew as its CFO in late 2015. Mr Tan has been involved in new project finance and development in South East Asia for the past 20 years.
 
We have not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar    proceeding.
