GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS 
 Description of the Company 
 On December 14, 2016, we announced the unveiling of our new name, PGT Innovations, Inc. (PGTI), formerly PGT, Inc. The name change is part of our strategy to bring together under a single identity our three, go-to-market brands serving the luxury, premium and mass custom impact-resistant window and door markets. We believe our products are the most technologically advanced impact-resistant window and door products in the industry, which we pioneered. We believe bringing together our three brands, PGT® Custom Windows & Doors, CGI®, and WinDoor®, under the umbrella of the PGT Innovations, Inc. name has further solidified our position as the leading manufacturer and supplier of residential impact-resistant windows and doors in the United States (the U.S.). 
 Our PGT Custom Windows & Doors impact-resistant products, which are marketed under the WinGuard® brand name, combine heavy-duty aluminum or vinyl frames with laminated glass to provide protection from hurricane-force winds and wind-borne debris by maintaining their structural integrity and substantially reducing the likelihood of penetration by impacting objects. Impact-resistant windows and doors satisfy stringent building codes in hurricane-prone coastal states and provide an attractive alternative to shutters and other active forms of hurricane protection that require installation and removal before and after each storm. Combining the impact resistance of WinGuard with our insulating glass creates energy efficient windows that can significantly reduce cooling and heating costs. We also manufacture non-impact resistant products in both aluminum and vinyl frames. Our current market share in Florida, which is the largest U.S. impact-resistant window and door market, is greater than that of any of our competitors. 
 On September 22, 2014, we completed the acquisition of CGI Windows and Doors Holdings, Inc. (CGI) which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. CGI was established in 1992 and has built a reputation for designing and manufacturing quality impact-resistant products that meet or exceed the stringent Miami-Dade County impact standards. We believe CGI is a leading innovator in product craftsmanship, strength and style, and that its brands are recognized and respected by the architectural community. CGI product lines include the Estate Collection, Sentinel by CGI, Estate Entrances, Commercial Series and Targa by CGI. On July 25, 2016, the Company created CGI Commercial, Inc. (CGIC) for the purpose of acquiring the operations of US Impact Systems, Inc. (USI), an established fabricator of storefront window and door products doing business primarily in the Miami area. CGIC, under the CGI brand, is the entity we use to market and sell our commercial storefront system products. 
 On February 16, 2016, we completed the acquisition of WinDoor, Incorporated (WinDoor), a provider of high-performance, impact-resistant windows and doors for high-end resorts, luxury high-rise condominiums, hotels and custom residential homes. WinDoor is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. At its manufacturing and administrative facilities in Orlando, Florida, WinDoor manufactures high-end, high-quality aluminum and thermally-broken aluminum products, featuring sliding glass doors, terrace doors, and windows. 
 At our manufacturing facilities in North Venice, Orlando, and Miami, Florida, where collectively we have approximately 2,700 employees, we produce fully-customized windows and doors for the luxury, premium and mass-custom markets, and have glass insulating, tempering and laminating facilities, which provide us with a more consistent source of impact-resistant laminated and insulated glass, shorter lead times, and lower costs relative to third-party sourcing. 
 The geographic regions in which we currently conduct business include the Southeastern U.S., Gulf Coast, Coastal mid-Atlantic, the Caribbean, Central America, and Canada. We distribute our products through multiple channels, including approximately 1,300 window distributors, building supply distributors, window replacement dealers and enclosure contractors. This broad distribution network provides us with the flexibility to meet demand as it shifts between the residential new construction and repair and remodeling end markets. 
 History 
 Our subsidiary, PGT Industries, Inc., a Florida Corporation, was founded in 1980 as Vinyl Tech, Inc. The PGT brand was established in 1987, and we introduced our WinGuard branded product line in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew in 1992. CGI

 became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PGT Industries, Inc. on September 22, 2014. WinDoor became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PGT Industries, Inc. on February 16, 2016. CGIC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of CGI on August 31, 2016. 
 PGT Innovations, Inc. is a Delaware corporation. We were formed on December 16, 2003 as PGT, Inc. On June 27, 2006, we became a publicly listed company on the NASDAQ Global Market (NASDAQ) under the symbol PGTI. We changed our name to PGT Innovations, Inc., which we announced on December 14, 2016. Effective on December 28, 2016, the listing of the Companys common stock was transferred to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and our common stock began trading on the NYSE under our existing ticker symbol of PGTI. 
 FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS 
 We operate as one segment, the manufacture and sale of windows and doors. Additional required information is included in Item 8. 
 NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

All our products carry one of our three brand names, and our consumer-oriented products carry an additional, trademarked product name. PGTs products carry the PGT® Custom Windows & Doors brand and carry the trademarked product names of WinGuard, WinGuard Vinyl, EnergyVue, and Eze-Breeze. CGIs products carry the CGI® brand and carry the trademarked product names of Estate Collection, Sentinel by CGI, Estate Entrances, Commercial Series and Targa by CGI. Also, under CGI, CGIC sells the Companys commercial storefront system. WinDoors products carry the WinDoor® brand and carry various product names, including its 3000 and 4000 Series aluminum windows, its 6000, 7000 and 8000 Series aluminum sliding glass doors, and its 9000 Series thermally broken windows and doors. 
PGT Custom Windows & Doors 
 WinGuard. WinGuard is an impact-resistant product line that combines heavy-duty aluminum or vinyl frames with laminated glass to provide protection from hurricane-force winds and wind-borne debris and satisfies increasingly stringent building codes. Our marketing and sales of the WinGuard product line is primarily targeted to hurricane-prone coastal states in the U.S., as well as the Caribbean and Central America. Combining the impact resistance of WinGuard with insulating glass creates energy efficient windows that can significantly reduce cooling and heating costs. Our WinGuard Vinyl line of windows and doors is designed to offer some of the highest design pressures available on impact-resistant windows and doors, in a modern profile, with larger sizes that satisfy the most stringent hurricane codes in the country. It protects against flying debris, intruders, outside noise and UV rays. 
 EnergyVue. EnergyVue is our non-impact vinyl window featuring energy-efficient insulating glass and multi-chambered frames that meet or exceed ENERGY STAR® standards in all climate zones to help consumers save on energy costs. Its new design has a refined modern profile and robust construction and is offered in larger sizes and higher design pressures, multiple frame colors, and a variety of hardware finishes, glass tints, grid styles and patterns. We announced the launch of EnergyVue in the first quarter of 2015. 
 Aluminum. We offer a complete line of fully customizable, non-impact-resistant aluminum frame windows and doors. These products primarily target regions with warmer climates, where aluminum is often preferred due to its ability to withstand higher structural loads. Adding insulating glass creates energy-efficient windows that can significantly reduce cooling and heating costs. 
 Eze-Breeze. Eze-Breeze non-glass vertical and horizontal sliding panels for porch enclosures are vinyl-glazed, aluminum-framed products used for enclosing screened-in porches that provide protection from inclement weather. This line was completed with the addition of a cabana door. 
 CGI 
 Estate Collection. Our Estate Collection of windows and doors is CGIs premium aluminum impact-resistant product line. These windows and doors can be found in high-end homes, resorts and hotels, and in schools and office buildings. Our Estate 
 
- 5 - 
 
 Collection combines protection against hurricane force damage with architectural-grade quality, handcrafted details and modern engineering. These windows and doors protect and insulate against hurricane winds and wind-driven debris, and offer UV protection. Estates aluminum frames are thicker than many of our competitors frames, making it a preferable choice for consumers in coastal areas prone to hurricanes. 
 Sentinel. Sentinel is a complete line of aluminum impact-resistant windows and doors from CGI that provides quality craftsmanship, energy efficiency and durability at a lower price point than our Estate Collection. Sentinel windows and doors are designed and manufactured with the objectives of enhancing home aesthetics, while delivering protection from hurricane winds and wind-borne debris. Sentinel is custom manufactured to exact sizes within our wide range of design parameters, therefore, reducing on-site construction costs. In addition, Sentinels frame depth is designed for both new construction and replacement applications, resulting in faster, less intrusive installations. 
 Targa. Targa is CGIs line of vinyl, energy-efficient, impact-resistant windows designed specifically to exceed the Florida impact codes, which are the most stringent impact standards in the U.S. Targa windows are designed with the objective of enhancing the aesthetics of a home, are relatively low maintenance, with long-term durability, and environmental compatibility. 
 Commercial Storefront System. Our Commercial Storefront window system and entry doors are engineered to provide a flexible yet economical solution for a variety of applications. Our system is designed with the goal of providing easy fabrication and assembly, while also reducing installation time and challenges. 
 WinDoor 
 Aluminum Doors and Windows. WinDoor produces a wide array of high-end, luxury aluminum doors and windows, including impact and non-impact sliding glass doors and terrace doors, fixed picture windows, single hung windows, and horizontal rolling windows. All of WinDoors aluminum windows are available in impact and non-impact versions and meet or exceed ENERGY STAR® standards in all climate zones. 
 Thermally Broken Doors and Windows. WinDoor produces a variety of aluminum thermally broken doors and windows. WinDoors thermally broken products provide the strength of aluminum with the energy ratings usually seen in only vinyl products. All of WinDoors thermally broken products are available in multiple shapes and sizes, have earned high performance ratings on impact and non-impact certifications, and meet or exceed ENERGY STAR® standards in all climate zones. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales strategy primarily focuses on attracting and retaining distributors and dealers with an expectation of consistently providing exceptional customer service, leading product designs and quality, and competitive pricing all using our advanced knowledge of building code requirements and technical expertise. 
 Our marketing strategy is designed to reinforce the quality of our products and focuses on both coastal and inland markets. We support our customers through print and web-based advertising, consumer, dealer, and builder promotions, and selling and collateral materials. We also work with our dealers and distributors to educate architects, building officials, consumers and homebuilders on the advantages of using impact-resistant and energy-efficient products. We market our products based on our expectations of quality, building code compliance, outstanding service, shorter lead times, and on-time delivery using our fleet of trucks and trailers. 
 Our Customers 
 We have a highly diversified base of approximately 1,300 window distributors, building supply distributors, window replacement dealers and enclosure contractors. Our largest customer accounts for approximately 5% of net sales and our top ten customers account for approximately 23% of net sales. Our sales are driven by residential new construction and home repair and remodeling end markets, which represented approximately 39% and 61% of our sales, respectively, during 2017. This compares to 42% and 58%, respectively, in 2016. 
 We do not supply our products directly to homebuilders but believe demand for our products is also a function of our strong relationships with certain national homebuilders.

Materials and Supplier Relationships 
 Our primary manufacturing materials include aluminum and vinyl extrusions, glass, ionoplast, and polyvinyl butyral. Although in many instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements are generally terminable by either party on limited notice. While most of our materials are typically available from other sources, transitioning to alternative sources would require us to complete testing and certifications related to impact-resistance and for the alternative source of supply to create the customized equipment and tooling necessary to provide the materials and components to us. Therefore, our goal is to develop and maintain lasting relationships with our materials suppliers. 
 Aluminum and vinyl extrusions accounted for approximately 39% of our material purchases during 2017. Sheet glass, which is sourced from two major national suppliers, accounted for approximately 11% of our material purchases during 2017. Sheet glass that we purchase comes in various sizes, tints, and thermal properties. From the sheet glass purchased, we produce some of our own laminated glass needs. However, in 2017 and 2016 due to some temporary capacity constraints, we purchased some of our laminated glass needs. This finished laminated glass made up approximately 18% of our material purchases in 2017. Polyvinyl butyral and ionoplast, which are both used as inner layer in laminated glass, accounted for approximately 10% of our material purchases during 2017. 
 On September 22, 2017, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) with Cardinal LG Company (Cardinal) for the sale to Cardinal of certain manufacturing equipment we used in processing glass components for PGT-branded doors for a cash purchase price of $28 million. Contemporaneously with entering into the APA, we entered into a seven-year supply agreement (SA) with Cardinal for Cardinal to supply us with glass components for PGT-branded doors. The Company determined to sell these assets and enter into the SA to allow us to heighten our focus in our core areas of window and door manufacturing and, at the same time, strengthen our supply chain for high-quality door glass from a supplier with whom we have been doing business for many years. 
 Backlog 
 As of December 30, 2017, our backlog was $51.3 million. As of December 31, 2016, our backlog was $40.6 million. Our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers that have not yet shipped, and we expect that a significant portion of our current backlog will be recognized as sales in the first quarter of 2018, due in part to our lead times which range from one to five weeks. WinDoors current lead times are approximately twelve weeks, substantially higher than is typical for this brand. WinDoors lead times have been negatively impacted by having to adjust to changes in leadership, systems and glass suppliers, all of which have caused operating disruptions which have affected its performance. We expect those operating disruptions to be resolved during 2018, with WinDoors lead times returning to a normal level contemporaneously. 
Intellectual Property 
 We own and have registered trademarks in the United States. In addition, we own several patents and patent applications concerning various aspects of window assembly and related processes. We are not aware of any circumstances that would have a material adverse effect on our ability to use our trademarks and patents. If we continue to renew our trademarks when necessary, the trademark protection provided by them is perpetual. 
Manufacturing 
 Our manufacturing facilities are in Florida where we produce customized products. The manufacturing process typically begins in our glass plant where we cut, temper, laminate, and insulate sheet glass to meet specific requirements of our customers orders. 
 Glass is transported to our window and door assembly lines in a make-to-order sequence where it is combined with an aluminum or vinyl frame. These frames are also fabricated to order. We start with a piece of extruded material which is cut and shaped into a frame that fits the customers specifications. Once complete, product is immediately staged for delivery and generally shipped on our trucking fleet within 48 hours of completion. 
 Competition 
 The window and door industry is highly fragmented, and the competitive landscape is based on geographic scope. The competition falls into the following categories. 
 Local and Regional Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors consists of numerous local job shops and small manufacturing facilities that tend to focus on selling products to local or regional dealers and wholesalers. Competitors in this group 
 
- 7 - 
 
 typically lack marketing support and the service levels and quality controls demanded by larger customers, as well as the ability to offer a full complement of products. 
 National Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors tends to focus on selling branded products nationally to dealers and wholesalers and has multiple locations. 
 International Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors consists of non-U.S. companies that have created entities and established manufacturing operations within Florida and have an increasing presence in the South Florida region as suppliers of windows and doors, primarily for high-rise buildings. 
 Active Protection: This group of competitors consists of manufactures that produce shutters and plywood, both of which are used to actively protect openings. Our impact windows and doors represent passive protection, meaning, once installed, no activity is required to protect a home from storm related hazards. 
 The principal methods of competition in the window and door industry are the development of long-term relationships with window and door dealers and distributors, and the retention of customers by delivering a full range of high-quality products in a timely manner, while offering competitive pricing and flexibility in transaction processing. Trade professionals such as contractors, homebuilders, architects and engineers also engage in direct interaction with manufacturers and look to the manufacturer for training and education related to products and codes. We believe our leading position in the U.S. impact-resistant window and door market, and the award-winning designs and quality of our products, position us well to meet the needs of our customers. 
 Environmental Considerations 
 Although our business and facilities are subject to federal, state, and local environmental regulation, environmental regulation does not have a material impact on our operations, and we believe that our facilities are in material compliance with such laws and regulations. 
Employees 
 As of the end of 2017, we employed approximately 2,700 people, none of whom were represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe we have good relations with our employees. 
FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS 
 Our domestic and international net sales for each of the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and January 2, 2016, are as follows (in millions):
