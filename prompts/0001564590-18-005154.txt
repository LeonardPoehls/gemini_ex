Item 1. Business.
Overview
 We are a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing gene therapy products for patients living with serious, life-threatening rare diseases caused by single gene defects.  We believe that gene therapy has powerful potential to treat these diseases through delivery of a functional copy of the gene to affected cells, resulting in production of the normal protein.  We have built a compelling portfolio of product candidates, including AT132 for the treatment of X-Linked Myotubular Myopathy, or XLMTM, AT342 for the treatment of Crigler-Najjar Syndrome, or Crigler-Najjar, AT982 for the treatment of Pompe disease and AT307 for the treatment of the CASQ2 subtype of Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia, or CASQ2-CPVT.  We have initiated Phase 1/2 clinical studies in our AT132 and AT342 programs, and plan to provide interim data from these studies in the second quarter of 2018.  We plan to file an IND for AT307 to treat CASQ2-CPVT in the first quarter of 2018, and are conducting IND-enabling preclinical studies of AT982 for the treatment of Pompe disease, for which we plan to file an IND in mid-2018.  We maintain full global rights to all our product candidates.
 We have developed a proprietary in-house cGMP manufacturing capability that we believe provides us with a core strategic advantage, enabling superior control over development timelines, costs and intellectual property.  Our manufacturing facility is located in South San Francisco in a building that we have improved to support our research, process development and manufacturing capabilities in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements.  We have established a comprehensive platform for production of our adeno-
 1


associated virus vector, or AAV, product candidates and plan continued investment to further optimize our manufacturing capabilities to cost-effectively produce high-quality AAV vectors at both clinical and commercial scale.
 Our vision is to be a global leader in AAV-based genetic medicine for rare diseases.  In pursuit of this goal, we are executing on our core strategic initiatives, which include the advancement of our current product candidates, the continued development of our proprietary in-house manufacturing capabilities, and the expansion of our pipeline.  We have assembled a world-class team with expertise in gene therapy, rare disease drug development and commercialization, and biologics manufacturing.
 Our mission is to bring innovative gene therapy products to patients living with serious, life-threatening rare diseases.  We believe our product candidates have the potential to provide long-lasting benefits from a single administration, changing the lives of patients with these devastating diseases.  Given the available clinical and regulatory pathways, we believe that the rarity and severity of the diseases we target may provide advantages for drug development, including the potential for expedited development and regulatory review, and market exclusivity.
 We focus on the treatment of rare diseases caused by single gene, or monogenic, defects in DNA that we believe can be effectively addressed using gene therapy.  Conventional approaches such as protein therapeutics attempt to replace the deficient protein, but they do not correct the underlying genetic defect causing the disease.  In addition, protein therapeutics often require frequent administration by injection or infusion and often result in sub-optimal safety and efficacy.  We believe gene therapy is an ideal treatment modality for diseases caused by monogenic defects.  Our portfolio of product candidates employs the use of AAV, a small, non-pathogenic virus that is genetically engineered to function as a delivery vehicle, or vector, and is administered to a patient to introduce a healthy copy of a mutated gene to the body.  AAV gene therapy vectors are modified such that they will not cause an infection like a normal virus, but are capable of delivering therapeutic genes into patients’ cells.  Vectors derived from AAV have a well-established safety profile in humans and have been shown to effectively deliver genes to the liver, eye, muscle and brain.  Preclinical and clinical data demonstrate that AAV vectors are capable of providing durable efficacy with a favorable adverse event profile due at least in part to AAV’s low immunogenic potential.  AAV vectors can be described by the serotype, or strain, of the original virus isolate that was used to form the outer shell, or capsid, of the vector.  We selected AAV8 and AAV9 as our in-licensed vector capsid serotypes, based on their biological properties, which we believe will translate into positive clinical effect in our target indications.
 Our business model is to develop and commercialize a broad portfolio of gene therapy product candidates to treat rare diseases.  We use a focused set of criteria to select product candidates that we believe have the best chance of success.  These criteria include:
  
• | serious, life-threatening rare diseases;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | monogenic diseases with well-understood biology;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | disease characteristics well-suited for treatment with AAV gene therapy technology;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | high potential for meaningful clinical benefit;

• | compelling preclinical data;
--+-----------------------------


• | clear measures for evaluation in clinical trials; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | opportunities for expedited development through established regulatory pathways.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have built a portfolio of gene therapy product candidates and we intend to further expand our portfolio over time.  Set forth below is a table summarizing our development programs.

AT132.  XLMTM is characterized by extreme muscle weakness, respiratory failure and early death, with an estimated 50% mortality rate in the first 18 months of life.  The disease is the result of mutations in the MTM1 gene that affect the production of myotubularin, an enzyme required for normal development and function of skeletal muscle.  The incidence of XLMTM is estimated to be one in 50,000 male births.  Currently, only supportive treatment options, such as ventilator use or a feeding tube, are available.  We are developing AT132, an AAV8 vector containing a functional copy of the MTM1 gene, for the treatment of XLMTM.  We believe AT132 may provide patients with significantly improved outcomes based on the ability of AAV8 to treat skeletal muscle.  Preclinical study results in both canine and murine models of the disease demonstrated dramatic improvements in all outcomes, including histology, muscle strength, respiratory function and survival.  Our goal is to achieve these same benefits in XLMTM patients following a single intravenous administration of AT132.
 The clinical development of AT132 was initiated with RECENSUS, a retrospective medical chart review designed to characterize the disease course, natural history and unmet medical need in XLMTM.  In December 2017, Audentes announced the publication of initial data from 112 boys in RECENSUS.  This analysis confirmed and expanded upon the understanding of the significant disease burden of XLMTM on patients, families and the healthcare system.  Audentes is also conducting INCEPTUS, a prospective natural history run-in study.  The primary objectives of INCEPTUS are to characterize the clinical condition of children with XLMTM, identify subjects for potential enrollment in ASPIRO (the Phase 1/2 clinical study of AT132 in XLMTM), and serve as a longitudinal baseline and within-patient control for ASPIRO.  Preliminary data reported from INCEPTUS confirm the significant neuromuscular and respiratory deficits experienced by XLMTM patients, and provide insight into the relevance and sensitivity of assessments used in ASPIRO.
 ASPIRO is a multicenter, multinational, open-label, ascending dose, delayed-treatment control study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of AT132 in approximately 12 XLMTM patients less than five years of age.  We initiated ASPIRO in September 2017 and reported interim data from the first dose cohort of ASPIRO patients in January 2018.  The interim data includes safety and efficacy assessments comprised of three AT132- treated patients dosed at 1x1014 vector genomes (vg) per kilogram (kg), and one delayed-treatment control patient.  As of December 21, 2017, individual patient follow-up ranged from 4 to 12 weeks.
 There has been a total of eight adverse events, or AEs, reported in ASPIRO, four of which were determined to be serious adverse events, or SAEs.  All SAEs occurred in Patient 3, the first of which was a hospitalization one-week post-administration due to pneumonia and was deemed not treatment-related. 
 Patient 3 was also hospitalized at week seven post-administration due to a gastrointestinal infection and three distinct SAEs, related to each other and deemed to be probably treatment-related.  These include myocarditis, 
 3


elevated troponin levels and mildly elevated creatinine kinase levels, each of which have been controlled with treatment.  Patient 3 was clinically stable throughout the hospital admission and has now been discharged from the hospital.
 Of the four non-serious AEs, two have been determined to be probably or possibly treatment-related.  Patient 1 experienced a mild, clinically asymptomatic exacerbation of a pre-existing elevated bilirubin level, which was deemed possibly treatment-related and resolved with treatment.  Patient 2 experienced a clinically asymptomatic elevation in liver enzyme levels toward the end of the protocol-specified prednisolone weaning period, which was deemed to be probably treatment-related and was controlled by extending the duration of steroid coverage.
 The key assessment of neuromuscular function in this first data set from the first dose cohort is the CHOP-INTEND scale, in which a maximal score of 64 reflects the level of neuromuscular function that a healthy baby is expected to approach by 3-6 months of age.  Additional analyses to be reported based on longer term follow-up include the MFM-20 and Bayley-III™ scales of infant and toddler development (fine and gross motor function).  Motor developmental milestones are captured within each of the neuromuscular assessments.
 The key assessment of respiratory function in this first data set from the first dose cohort is a measurement of maximal inspiratory pressure, or MIP, for which values of 80 cmH2O or greater are considered normal in healthy children less than 5 years of age.  Additional analyses to be reported based on longer term follow-up include measurement of maximal expiratory pressure, or MEP, time per day on invasive ventilatory support (tracheostomy) or non-invasive respiratory support (BiPAP), and for those patients who are on 24-hour continuous ventilatory support, an assessment of ability to maintain adequate respiratory function while off a ventilator, termed “respiratory sprinting.”

 Physicians and caregivers have reported progressive qualitative improvements in disease severity in all treated patients.  Ventilator settings (pressure, rate and volume of mechanical ventilation) have been reduced in Patients 1 
 4


and 2.  All treated patients have demonstrated improvements in airway clearance control, including swallowing and coughing, which is critical to preventing aspiration.  By way of example, at baseline Patient 1 required suctioning of the oro-pharyngeal cavity several times per hour, and by week 12 he required no suctioning.  In addition, investigators report anecdotally that all treated patients have increased limb and trunk strength, which is an early indicator of gross motor function improvement, and that the velocity and accuracy of their movements have increased.  Caregivers also report that patients have increased vocalization, improving their ability to communicate.
 AT132 has been granted orphan drug designation in both the United States and European Union, and the FDA has granted AT132 Rare Pediatric Disease and Fast Track designations.
 AT342.  Crigler-Najjar is a rare, congenital autosomal recessive monogenic disease characterized by severely high levels of bilirubin in the blood, which presents a significant risk of irreversible neurological damage and death.  The average life expectancy is reported as being 30 years of age with phototherapy.  Crigler- Najjar is estimated to affect approximately one in 1,000,000 newborns.  Infants with Crigler-Najjar develop severe jaundice shortly after birth resulting in rapid presentation and diagnosis.  Crigler-Najjar is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the UGT1A1 (uridine-diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1) enzyme resulting in an inability to convert unconjugated bilirubin to a water-soluble form that can be excreted from the body.  Clinical diagnosis is confirmed via genetic testing of the UGT1A1 gene.  The current standard of care for Crigler-Najjar is aggressive management of high bilirubin levels with persistent, daily phototherapy, usually for longer than 10 to 12 hours per day using intense fluorescent light focused on the bare skin, while the eyes are shielded.  Phototherapy speeds bilirubin decomposition and excretion and lowers serum bilirubin, but wanes in effectiveness as children age due to thickening of the skin and reduction in surface area to body mass ratio.  Data from our prospective natural history study LUSTRO demonstrate that persistent phototherapy only reduces bilirubin to levels just below those that are considered to be neurotoxic.  In some cases, a liver transplant may be required for survival.
 We are developing AT342, an AAV8 vector containing a functional version of the UGT1A1 gene.  We have conducted a dose ranging study of AT342 in a Crigler-Najjar knockout mouse model.  In this study, a single tail vein injection of AT342 rapidly reduced and normalized bilirubin levels for the duration of the study, an effect that was seen across a range of doses.  Previously reported results demonstrate that administration of AAV8-UGT1A1 in newborn Crigler-Najjar mice significantly and durably reduced bilirubin levels, even at UGT1A1 liver expression levels of just five to eight percent of normal.  We are advancing AT342 with the goal of administering a single dose that results in a robust, durable reduction in serum bilirubin, a reduction in or elimination of lengthy daily phototherapy, and elimination of the need for a liver transplant.  We believe that serum bilirubin levels will be a clinically relevant endpoint and that determination of efficacy of AT342 will be straightforward due to the ease and reliability of measurement.
 The IND for AT342 is active, and we have initiated LUSTRO, a prospective natural history-run-in study designed to characterize the disease course, natural history, bilirubin variability and phototherapy usage of patients with Crigler-Najjar.  In November 2017, we reported interim data from the LUSTRO study, which confirms the significant risks posed by elevated bilirubin levels in Crigler-Najjar patients and the significant burden on patients and their families that must configure their lives to ensure rigorous adherence to phototherapy of more than 10 to 12 hours per day.  In February 2018, we announced the initiation of VALENS, the Phase 1/2 clinical study of AT342, and expect preliminary clinical data from VALENS to be available in the second quarter of 2018.
 AT342 has been granted orphan drug designation in both the United States and the European Union and the FDA has granted AT342 Rare Pediatric Disease and Fast Track designations.
 AT982.  Pompe disease is a serious, progressive genetic disease characterized by severe muscle weakness, respiratory failure leading to ventilator dependence and, in infants, increased cardiac mass and heart failure.  The incidence of Pompe disease is reported to be approximately one in 40,000 births.  The infantile onset form of Pompe disease is often fatal due to cardio-respiratory failure within the first year of life. In the late onset form of Pompe, which typically manifests in the third or fourth decades of life, the disease is progressive and life-limiting with significant ventilator and wheelchair use.  Both forms of Pompe disease are caused by mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme alpha-glucosidase, or GAA, which results in a deficiency of GAA protein and leads to the accumulation of glycogen in an intracellular organelle known as the lysosome.  The only approved treatment for Pompe disease is enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT, which is a chronic treatment delivered in bi-weekly 
 5


intravenous infusions.  Despite the availability of ERT, significant medical need persists, which is primarily due to the immunogenicity of ERT and its inability to penetrate all of the key tissues affected by Pompe disease.  We believe that gene therapy may effectively address these limitations.
 In February 2018, we reported the results from a preclinical construct selection study conducted in a well-established murine model of Pompe disease. The study evaluated both AAV8 and AAV9 capsid serotypes, paired with novel promoter elements.  The study evaluated constructs across a three-log dose range and included a broad battery of biochemical and immunological assays.  Of the six vectors evaluated, an AAV8 vector with a novel hybrid promoter was selected as the clinical development candidate, AT982.  
 AT982 is designed to address the recognized limitations of ERT by using an AAV8 vector capsid (known to effectively penetrate skeletal muscle, the heart and the nervous system) that delivers a GAA expression cassette containing a novel hybrid promoter to drive GAA expression in tissues relevant to Pompe disease.  The expression cassette utilizes the desmin promoter, known to direct gene expression in muscle and the nervous system, and a liver expression enhancer element, incorporated with the goal of inducing immune tolerance to GAA protein.  We believe that the AAV8 vector capsid coupled with the novel hybrid promoter is a differentiated approach that optimizes the potential of AT982 to deliver long term and transformative clinical benefit to Pompe patients following a single administration.
 We are currently conducting our IND-enabling nonclinical studies and expect to submit an IND for AT982 in mid-2018. We plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 study of AT982 in Pompe disease in the fourth quarter of 2018.  Both the FDA and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, have granted orphan drug designation to a prototype version of AT982, which we plan to update to reflect the use of our new hybrid promoter vector for development.
 AT307.  CASQ2-CPVT is a rare monogenic disease that is characterized by life-threatening arrhythmias that may lead to sudden cardiac death.  There are currently only limited treatment options with variable efficacy for patients suffering from CPVT, including beta-blockers and a sodium channel blocker, flecainide.  The autosomal recessive form of the disease is caused by mutations in the calsequestrin 2 gene, or CASQ2 gene, and is characterized by stress-induced heartbeat rhythm changes in an otherwise structurally normal heart.  Literature estimates suggest that CPVT occurs in one in 10,000 people, with approximately 2% to 5% due to mutations in the CASQ2 gene.  This equates to an approximate prevalence of 6,000 affected people in North America, Europe and other addressable markets.  To confirm these numbers, we have recently initiated activities to identify CASQ2-CPVT patients and further characterize the disease burden and unmet medical need for patients living with CPVT.  Despite treatment with anti-arrhythmia therapies, sympathectomy and implantable cardiac defibrillators, a significant portion of the patients remain symptomatic.  We are developing AT307, an AAV8 vector containing a functional version of the CASQ2 gene.  Preclinical data in murine models of the disease demonstrated an ability to prevent ventricular tachycardia through restoration of CASQ2 protein expression.  We are advancing AT307 with the goal of providing a single administration of AT307 that results in a significant reduction in life-threatening arrhythmic events and a major improvement in quality of life.
 We plan to submit an IND for AT307 in the first quarter of 2018, and to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical study in the fourth quarter of 2018.  In this study, we plan to use the efficacy endpoint of an exercise electrocardiogram, which we believe provides a clear means to evaluate therapeutic benefit.  Both the FDA and EMA have granted orphan drug designation to a prototype version of AT307, which we plan to update to reflect the final construct we intend to advance into clinical trials.
 We have a focused, passionate team with collective expertise in gene therapy, rare disease drug development and commercialization, and biologics manufacturing.  Matthew Patterson, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder, is a biotechnology leader with over 20 years of experience at Genzyme Corporation, BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Amicus Therapeutics and our company.

Gene Therapy Background
 Genes are composed of sequences of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, which code for proteins that perform a broad range of physiologic functions within all living organisms. DNA is a large, highly charged molecule that is difficult to transport across a cell membrane and deliver to the nucleus, where it can be transcribed and translated into protein.
 Gene therapy is a therapeutic approach to treating genetic diseases caused by mutations in DNA. For gene therapy to work, an isolated gene sequence or segment of DNA needs to be delivered efficiently to the desired target tissues and cell types. The treatment involves the administration of a functional gene to produce normal protein within a patient’s cells, offering the potential for durable therapeutic benefit. To achieve these goals, scientists have designed and developed a variety of viral vectors to facilitate gene delivery into cells.
 Our Approach
 The AAV gene therapy vectors we utilize have proven capable of transducing a wide range of tissues with generally little or no toxicity and only mild immune response. Functionally, AAV packages a single-stranded linear DNA genome that can be engineered to contain a therapeutic gene in place of all the virus genes. AAV vectors have a well-established safety profile and do not naturally propagate by themselves in the absence of another viral infection, reducing the likelihood of inappropriate viral spread following administration. As a result, AAV vectors are emerging as the preferred delivery vehicle for gene therapy.
 Our vector design strategy includes careful selection of the vector capsid (the outer protein shell) and sophisticated engineering of the vector genome (the therapeutic DNA expression cassette) to target the correct tissues and improve the potential to provide patients with meaningful and durable outcomes. Careful attention to optimizing these vector design elements can reduce immune responses that attenuate the function of AAV vectors, and enable more robust trafficking to the specific tissues we care about for each disease. The vector genome is composed of multiple structural elements, including the gene coding sequence and the promoter, which drives expression of the gene. We use the latest available technology to engineer the vector genome to direct the target cells to make the desired protein at the appropriate level necessary to achieve a therapeutic effect for the longest period possible. We believe the product candidates we have created offer distinct advantages for our indications due to their selectivity for target tissue types and focused expression of the desired protein.
 Our Product Candidate and Target Indication Selection Criteria
 Our business model is to develop and commercialize a broad portfolio of gene therapy product candidates to treat rare diseases. We use a focused set of criteria to select product candidates that we believe have the best chance of success. These criteria include:

• | Serious, life-threatening rare diseases with high unmet medical need. We target rare indications where there are limitations with existing therapeutic options or no such options exist, particularly with an opportunity to bring products with high value to patients and their caregivers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Monogenic diseases with well-understood biology. Gene therapy is particularly effective when applied to replace a single gene producing a single protein, the function of which is well understood.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High potential for meaningful clinical benefit. We focus on diseases with the potential to demonstrate a meaningful therapeutic effect with only moderate levels of expression of the deficient protein.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Well suited for AAV gene therapy. We select target indications and product candidates where we believe AAV technology can be used effectively.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Compelling preclinical data. We look for product candidates that have positive results from preclinical studies in animal models of disease that provide increased confidence in the potential for positive human results.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Clear measures for evaluation in clinical trials. We prioritize diseases that we believe have the potential for straightforward clinical endpoints to demonstrate efficacy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Opportunities for expedited development through established regulatory pathways. We believe our product candidates may be eligible for expedited regulatory review, including Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations.

Our AAV Product Candidates
 AT132 for the Treatment of X-Linked Myotubular Myopathy
 Overview of XLMTM
 XLMTM is a rare, severe, congenital muscle disease with an estimated incidence of one in 50,000 male births. The disease is caused by mutations in the MTM1 gene, which encodes a protein called myotubularin. Myotubularin is an enzyme involved in the development, maturation, maintenance and function of skeletal muscle cells. Mutations in the MTM1 gene result in production of too little or no functional protein. Importantly, we believe that even a modest increase of functional protein may have a significant therapeutic benefit for XLMTM patients.
 Infants with XLMTM are typically born with severe muscle weakness and the majority require chronic mechanical ventilation from birth. Approximately 50% of patients die in the first 18 months of life. There is no approved treatment for XLMTM and disease management is primarily supportive. Of the patients that survive the infantile period, most are severely incapacitated, require ventilator support and do not have a life expectancy beyond early adolescence. Diagnosis of XLMTM is generally based on recognition of clinical symptoms at birth, typically followed by muscle biopsy and confirmation with genetic testing. Like many rare diseases, we believe XLMTM is under diagnosed and that approval of treatment would increase disease awareness, screening and diagnosis.
 AT132 Description
 AT132 is an AAV8 vector that delivers an MTM1 gene expression cassette containing a desmin promoter, which is a regulatory element that drives gene transcription in muscle tissue. The MTM1 cassette is capable of increasing myotubularin expression in targeted tissues. AT132 was designed with these elements because AAV8 is known to effectively penetrate skeletal muscle and the desmin promoter is primarily active in muscle. We believe AT132 has the potential to provide long-term clinical benefit to XLMTM patients through persistent expression of the functional protein following a single intravenous administration.
 Preclinical Proof-of-Concept for AT132
 We have two robust animal models of XLMTM, a murine model consisting of mice engineered to knock out the functional MTM1 gene, or MTM1 KO mice, and a naturally occurring canine model. Both models present with disease symptoms similar to that of humans including severe muscle weakness, respiratory failure and early death. Preclinical studies in these models have used an AT132 construct engineered to include the species-specific MTM1 transgene.

Murine Model
 Through multiple studies in the murine model, symptom onset occurs at approximately two to three weeks of age, and there is rapid progression of the disease leading to death at approximately seven to eight weeks of age. Through multiple studies in this model, treatment with AT132 has been shown to significantly improve disease symptoms when compared to untreated controls. Specifically, the administration of a single intravenous dose of AT132 (2 x 1014 vg/kg, or vector genomes per kilogram) to eight mice at three weeks of age resulted in improved muscle strength, nearly normal growth and long-term survival in MTM1 KO mice. In order to evaluate the potential benefit of treatment of mice at a later stage of disease, the same dose was administered to 11 severely affected MTM1 KO mice at five weeks of age, when 20% of the animals in the treatment group had already died, and a robust effect on survival was again observed. 
Canine Model
 In the naturally occurring canine model, symptom onset occurs at nine to ten weeks of age, and disease progression leads to death at approximately 18 weeks of age. Multiple studies in this model have demonstrated that a single administration of AT132 significantly improves all disease symptoms and survival rates. In two dogs treated in one of the earliest studies, these effects have lasted over five years to date and the dogs continue to thrive.
 The first canine study was designed as a proof-of-concept to determine whether AT132 could improve muscle strength and organ function in comparison to an XLMTM dog treated with a placebo. Administration of a single dose of AT132 (2.0 x 1014 vg/kg) to three dogs at nine weeks of age resulted in maintenance of muscle strength, respiratory function and survival comparable to normal dogs. 
 Most importantly, all treated dogs achieved a statistically significant improvement in survival, which extended far beyond the critical 18-week time point, when all untreated XLMTM dogs could no longer ambulate. All three of the treated dogs survived for the one-year duration of the study. One of these dogs was euthanized for study purposes.  The remaining two dogs have surpassed five years of age and remain indistinguishable from normal dogs.
 The second canine study was designed to compare the effects of three different doses of AT132 delivered by systemic administration versus untreated XLMTM and normal dogs. The three doses, a low dose (3 x 1013 vg/kg), a mid-dose (2 x 1014 vg/kg) and a high dose (5 x 1014 vg/kg), were administered to XLMTM dogs at ten weeks of age and the dogs were evaluated for 45 weeks. Three dogs were treated at each dose.  In the mid and high dose cohorts, the study reported homogeneous biodistribution of the vector in skeletal muscle throughout the body, and robust expression levels of myotubularin. Specifically, the mid dose resulted in a range of 10% to 40% of normal myotubularin levels, and the high dose resulted in approximately 100% of normal myotubularin levels as measured in a wide range of skeletal muscle.
 Clinical Development of AT132
 The clinical development of AT132 was initiated with RECENSUS, a retrospective medical chart review designed to characterize the disease course, natural history and unmet medical need in XLMTM.  In December 2017, we announced the publication of initial data from 112 boys in RECENSUS.  This analysis confirmed and expanded upon the understanding of the significant disease burden of XLMTM on patients, families and the healthcare system.  We are also conducting INCEPTUS, a prospective natural history run-in study.  The primary objectives of INCEPTUS are to characterize the clinical condition of children with XLMTM, identify subjects for potential enrollment in ASPIRO (the Phase 1/2 clinical study of AT132 in XLMTM), and serve as a longitudinal baseline and within-patient control for ASPIRO.  Preliminary data reported from INCEPTUS confirm the significant neuromuscular and respiratory deficits experienced by XLMTM patients, and provide insight into the relevance and sensitivity of assessments used in ASPIRO.
 ASPIRO is a multicenter, multinational, open-label, ascending dose, delayed-treatment control Phase 1/2 clinical study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of AT132 in approximately 12 XLMTM patients less than five years of age.  Primary endpoints include safety (adverse events and certain laboratory measures, including immunological parameters) and efficacy (assessments of neuromuscular and respiratory function). Secondary endpoints include the burden of disease and health related quality-of-life, and muscle tissue histology and 
 10


biomarkers. The primary efficacy analysis is expected to be conducted at 12 months, with interim evaluations expected to be conducted at earlier time points. After the primary 12-month assessment, subjects are expected to be followed for another four years to assess long term safety, durability of effect and developmental progression.
 We initiated ASPIRO in September 2017 and reported interim data from the first dose cohort of ASPIRO patients in January 2018.  The interim data includes safety and efficacy assessments comprised of three AT132- treated patients dosed at 1x1014 vector genomes (vg) per kilogram (kg), and one delayed-treatment control patient.  As of December 21, 2017, individual patient follow-up ranged from 4 to 12 weeks.
 There have been a total of eight adverse events, or AEs, reported in ASPIRO, four of which were determined to be serious adverse events, or SAEs.  All SAEs occurred in Patient 3, the first of which was a hospitalization one-week post-administration due to pneumonia and was deemed not treatment-related.
 Patient 3 was also hospitalized at week seven post-administration due to a gastrointestinal infection and three distinct SAEs, related to each other and deemed to be probably treatment-related.  These include myocarditis, elevated troponin levels and mildly elevated creatinine kinase levels, each of which have been controlled with treatment.  Patient 3 was clinically stable throughout the hospital admission and has now been discharged from the hospital.
 Of the four non-serious AEs, two have been determined to be probably or possibly treatment-related.  Patient 1 experienced a mild, clinically asymptomatic exacerbation of a pre-existing elevated bilirubin level, which was deemed possibly treatment-related and resolved with treatment.  Patient 2 experienced a clinically asymptomatic elevation in liver enzyme levels toward the end of the protocol-specified prednisolone weaning period, which was deemed to be probably treatment-related and was controlled by extending the duration of steroid coverage.
 The key assessment of neuromuscular function in this first data set from the first dose cohort is the CHOP-INTEND scale, in which a maximal score of 64 reflects the level of neuromuscular function that a healthy baby is expected to approach by 3-6 months of age.  Additional analyses to be reported based on longer term follow-up include the MFM-20 and Bayley-III™ scales of infant and toddler development (fine and gross motor function).  Motor developmental milestones are captured within each of the neuromuscular assessments.
 The key assessment of respiratory function in this first data set from the first dose cohort is a measurement of maximal inspiratory pressure, or MIP, for which values of 80 cmH2O or greater are considered normal in healthy children less than 5 years of age.  Additional analyses to be reported based on longer term follow-up include measurement of maximal expiratory pressure, or MEP, time per day on invasive ventilatory support (tracheostomy) or non-invasive respiratory support (BiPAP), and for those patients who are on 24-hour continuous ventilatory support, an assessment of ability to maintain adequate respiratory function while off a ventilator, termed “respiratory sprinting.”

 Physicians and caregivers have reported progressive qualitative improvements in disease severity in all treated patients.  Ventilator settings (pressure, rate and volume of mechanical ventilation) have been reduced in Patients 1 and 2.  All treated patients have demonstrated improvements in airway clearance control, including swallowing and coughing, which is critical to preventing aspiration.  By way of example, at baseline Patient 1 required suctioning of the oro-pharyngeal cavity several times per hour, and by week 12 he required no suctioning.  In addition, investigators report anecdotally that all treated patients have increased limb and trunk strength, which is an early indicator of gross motor function improvement, and that the velocity and accuracy of their movements have increased.  Caregivers also report that patients have increased vocalization, improving their ability to communicate.
 Based on the encouraging preliminary profile of AT132 in the first three treated patients at the 1x1014 vg/kg dose, we plan to enroll an additional three patients at this same dose prior to opening a new dose cohort.  The next update of interim data from ASPIRO is planned in the second quarter of 2018.
 Regulatory Interactions
 AT132 has been granted orphan drug designation in both the United States and the European Union, and the FDA has granted AT132 Rare Pediatric Disease and Fast Track designations.
 AT342 for the Treatment of Crigler-Najjar
 Overview of Crigler-Najjar
 Crigler-Najjar is a rare, congenital autosomal recessive monogenic disease characterized by severely high levels of bilirubin in the blood and risk of irreversible neurological damage and death. Crigler-Najjar is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the UGT1A1 (uridine-diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1) enzyme resulting in an inability to convert unconjugated bilirubin to a water-soluble form that can be excreted from the body. Unconjugated bilirubin can cross the blood brain barrier, and the accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in the central nervous system can lead to irreversible neurological damage and death.
 Infants with Crigler-Najjar develop severe jaundice shortly after birth resulting in rapid presentation and diagnosis. Clinical diagnosis can be confirmed via genetic testing of the UGT1A1 gene. The current standard of care for Crigler-Najjar is aggressive management of high bilirubin levels with persistent, daily phototherapy, usually for longer than 10 to 12 hours per day, for the rest of a patient’s life. Exchange transfusion or plasmapheresis are sometimes required in order to lower bilirubin levels rapidly. Phototherapy becomes less effective as a child ages, beginning around the age of four years. Average life expectancy is reported as being 30 years of age with phototherapy, and there is an ongoing lifelong risk of a catastrophic cerebral event. Crigler-Najjar is estimated to affect approximately one in 1,000,000 newborns.
 Limitations of Current Therapy for Crigler-Najjar
 There are currently no products approved specifically for the treatment of Crigler-Najjar. The current standard of care for Crigler-Najjar is aggressive management of high bilirubin levels, with persistent, daily phototherapy, usually for longer than 10 to 12 hours per day using intense fluorescent light focused on the bare skin, while the eyes 
 12


are shielded. The impact on quality of life is substantial. Phototherapy speeds bilirubin decomposition and excretion, lowering serum bilirubin to levels that are just below those considered to be neurotoxic. As children get older, compliance with phototherapy becomes challenging. As Crigler-Najjar infants and children begin to experience progression of neurological symptoms and increasing risk of a catastrophic cerebral event, a liver transplant is often required for survival. However, limited donor organ availability, the risks associated with the transplant procedure itself and potential for organ rejection limit the utility of a transplant as a treatment modality for Crigler-Najjar.
 AT342 Description
 AT342 consists of an AAV8 vector capsid designed to deliver a functional UGT1A1 gene and increase UGT1A1 protein expression in the liver and other tissues. Importantly, AAV8 has high affinity for liver cells allowing for the efficient introduction of therapeutic genes into liver cells. We believe that AT342 has the potential to provide long-term clinical benefit to Crigler-Najjar patients through persistent expression of the protein following a single administration, resulting in significant reduction in bilirubin levels, reduction or elimination of the need for lengthy daily phototherapy treatment and elimination of the need for a liver transplant.
 Preclinical Proof-of-Concept for AT342
 We conducted a dose ranging study of AT342 in a Crigler-Najjar knockout mouse model.  In this study, a single tail vein injection at doses of 2.5 x 1012 vg/kg and 2.5 x 1013 vg/kg of AT342 rapidly reduced and normalized bilirubin levels for the duration of the study.
 AT342 Reduces Total Bilirubin Levels in a Crigler-Najjar Syndrome Mouse Model
 

In a previously reported preclinical proof-of-concept study using AAV8-UGT1A1 in a murine model of Crigler-Najjar syndrome, a single administration of AAV8-UGT1A1 resulted in a rapid and significant reduction in total bilirubin levels of 12 mice as compared to 11 mice that received only phototherapy. The administration of AAV8-UGT1A1 also proved durable, lasting the entire 17-month duration of the study. Bilirubin levels at 17 months were over 50% lower in AAV8-UGT1A1 treated mice versus control mice that received only phototherapy. Furthermore, bilirubin levels remained below the level at which neurological damage is observed in this model for the duration of the study.
 13


Clinical Development of AT342
 The clinical development plan for AT342 consists of LUSTRO, a clinical assessment and Phase 1/2 run-in study designed to characterize the disease course, natural history, bilirubin variability and phototherapy usage of patients with Crigler-Najjar and VALENS, the Phase 1/2 clinical study of AT342.

• | LUSTRO - Clinical Assessment and Phase 1/2 Run-in Study (Ongoing): LUSTRO is an international, clinical assessment study of approximately five to ten patients greater than or equal to one year of age with Crigler-Najjar. The primary objective of this study is to characterize the disease course, natural history, bilirubin variability and phototherapy usage of patients with Crigler-Najjar, with a specific focus on serum bilirubin levels and time on phototherapy. In addition, the study will assess the burden of disease on Crigler-Najjar subjects and caregivers. The study is also expected to identify patients for potential enrollment in VALENS, the Phase 1/2 study of Crigler-Najjar, and to serve as a within-patient control for VALENS.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In October 2017, we presented a preliminary analysis from three patients enrolled in LUSTRO.  These data confirm that despite persistent daily phototherapy, total bilirubin levels in Crigler Najjar patients are maintained only just below those that are known to be neurotoxic.  These data further confirm the significant burden of disease for patients and caregivers and the ongoing risk of catastrophic cerebral events associated with phototherapy.
  
• | VALENS - Phase 1/2 Study (Planned): The Phase 1/2 study of AT342 is a multicenter, multinational, open-label, ascending dose, delayed-treatment concurrent control study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of AT342 in approximately 12 Crigler-Najjar patients greater than or equal to one year of age. The study is expected to include nine AT342 treated subjects and three delayed-treatment concurrent control subjects. Primary endpoints include safety (adverse events and certain laboratory measures, including immunological parameters) and efficacy (changes in serum bilirubin and number of hours on phototherapy). Secondary endpoints include the proportion of subjects successfully weaned off of phototherapy, and UGT protein expression, DNA and RNA levels from liver biopsy at 24 weeks. Subjects are expected to remain on prescribed phototherapy for 12 weeks following administration of AT342. Subjects with a meaningful decrease in bilirubin at week 12 will be tapered down and weaned off of phototherapy over a five week period, starting in week 13 and ending during week 17. The primary efficacy analyses are expected to be conducted at the 12 and 18 week time points. Subjects are expected to be followed for a minimum of five years to assess long term safety and durability of effect. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In February 2018, we announced that the first patient had been enrolled in VALENS. We plan to report preliminary interim data from VALENS in the second quarter of 2018.

 AT982 for the Treatment of Pompe Disease
 Overview of Pompe Disease
 Pompe disease is a rare, severe, progressive, congenital neuromuscular disease. The overall incidence is estimated to be approximately one in 40,000 births although frequency and disease progression varies with age of onset, ethnicity and geography. The disease is characterized by mutations in the gene that encodes the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase, or GAA. GAA is responsible for degrading glycogen within the intracellular organelle known as the lysosome.  Dysfunction or absence of functional GAA results in toxic accumulation of glycogen in the lysosome. Tissues and cells most affected by the disease are predominantly skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and the nervous system.
 The severity of Pompe disease symptoms and rate of progression is highly variable and correlated with age of symptom onset and the degree of enzyme deficiency. Infantile-onset disease, the most severe form of Pompe disease, accounts for approximately one quarter of all affected patients. Those with infantile-onset disease are 
 14


usually diagnosed in the first few months of life due to the severe presentation associated with total or near- total absence of GAA activity, and confirmatory diagnosis is made through genetic testing. These infants usually present with feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, hypotonia, progressive weakness, respiratory distress, severe enlargement of the tongue and thickening of the heart muscle. If left untreated, these children usually die in the first year of life. Those with late-onset disease typically have enzyme levels at 1% to 40% of normal and usually have symptoms such as reduced mobility and respiratory problems. Late-onset patients experience progressive difficulty walking and respiratory decline, and although life expectancy can vary, it is a life-limiting disease and death generally occurs due to complications from respiratory failure. Newborn-screening programs can successfully identify Pompe disease in the newborn period, but such programs have not yet been widely implemented worldwide.
 Limitations of Current Therapy for Pompe Disease
 The only approved treatment for Pompe disease is enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT. Although ERT is the current standard of care for the disease, it has a number of recognized limitations:

• | Currently approved versions of ERT are administered every two weeks, and in some cases more frequently.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Large doses of ERT have to be delivered systemically in order to achieve potentially therapeutic levels in target tissues, and as a result approximately 90% of patients develop antibodies against the therapy. Such antibody responses may impact both the safety and efficacy of ERT. Currently approved ERT products carry a black box warning related to the risk of life-threatening anaphylaxis, and severe allergic and immune mediated reactions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | While initial studies of ERT demonstrated that treatment improved survival and ventilator-free survival of patients with early-onset disease, long-term follow-up of these patients indicates substantial disease progression. Subsequent analyses of the effectiveness of ERT have identified variations in outcomes, with most infants exhibiting declines in motor and respiratory function and reduced survival despite treatment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ERT is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier and thus cannot reduce the accumulation of glycogen in the nervous system. It is believed that glycogen accumulation is particularly detrimental to the function of the neural cells, and thus the inability of ERT to reach these cells may lead to incomplete treatment of the underlying pathology and account for the failure of ERT to halt disease progression and reverse functional decline.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Chronic therapy with ERT is costly. Experts in health technology assessment have projected the lifetime costs of ERT to be in excess of $7 million for patients with infantile onset Pompe. Due to the requirement of dosing by body weight, the cost for infantile patients increases year-over-year as these patients grow.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AT982 Description
 AT982 is designed to address the recognized limitations of ERT by using an AAV8 vector capsid (known to effectively penetrate skeletal muscle, the heart and the nervous system) that delivers a GAA expression cassette containing a novel hybrid promoter to drive GAA expression in tissues relevant to Pompe disease.  The expression cassette utilizes the desmin promoter, known to direct gene expression in muscle and the nervous system, and a liver expression enhancer element, incorporated with the goal of inducing immune tolerance to GAA protein.  We believe that the AAV8 vector capsid coupled with the novel hybrid promoter is a differentiated approach that optimizes the potential of AT982 to deliver long term and transformative clinical benefit to Pompe patients following a single administration.
 Preclinical Proof-of-Concept for AT982
 In February 2018 we reported the results from a preclinical construct selection study conducted in a well-established murine model of Pompe disease. The study evaluated both AAV8 and AAV9 capsid serotypes, paired with novel promoter elements designed to target GAA expression in a range of tissues, including skeletal and cardiac muscle, the nervous system and the liver.  The study evaluated the six constructs across a three-log dose 
 15


range and included a broad battery of biochemical and immunological assays.  Of the six vectors evaluated, an AAV8 vector with a novel muscle-liver hybrid promoter was selected as the clinical development candidate, AT982.
 In the preclinical construct selection study in the Pompe mouse model, AT982 was confirmed to provide dose-dependent GAA expression and activity in neural tissues, reduced glycogen accumulation and improved muscle pathology, and a favorable immune profile as measured by anti-GAA antibody titer.

Planned Development of AT982
 We are currently conducting IND enabling preclinical studies and plan to submit an IND for AT982 in mid-2018, and to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of AT982 in the fourth quarter of 2018.  In parallel, we are initiating manufacturing activities at our internal facility to develop a robust and scalable process appropriate to support the needs of our planned clinical trials and eventual commercial sales, if approved.
 16


Regulatory Interactions
 Meetings with global regulatory authorities to discuss pre-IND and pre-CTA activities are underway. A scientific advice meeting has been held with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, and we have scheduled a pre-CTA meeting with the Paul Ehrlich Institute, or PEI, and a pre-IND meeting with the FDA. Both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, have granted orphan drug designation to a prototype version of AT982, which we plan to update to reflect the use of our new hybrid promoter vector for development.
AT307 for Treatment of CASQ2-Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia
 Overview of CASQ2-CPVT
 CASQ2-CPVT is a life-threatening, autosomal recessive, inherited cardiac disease caused by mutations in the CASQ2 gene that encodes the protein called calsequestrin 2. The CASQ2 protein plays a key role in the release of calcium within the cardiac muscle cell, which is necessary for normal cardiac contractile function to maintain normal heart rhythm. Literature estimates suggest that CPVT occurs in one in 10,000 people, with approximately 2% to 5% due to mutations in the CASQ2 gene. This equates to an estimated prevalence of 6,000 affected people in North America, Europe and other addressable markets.  To confirm these numbers, we have recently initiated activities to identify CASQ2-CPVT patients and further characterize the disease burden and unmet medical need for patients living with CPVT.
 CPVT is characterized by the sudden occurrence of severe ventricular arrhythmia that can cause dizziness and fainting, and can progress rapidly to cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death. These arrhythmias are triggered during exercise or in response to a sudden stressful occurrence. It is estimated that 30% of people with CASQ2-CPVT will have had a cardiac event by the age of ten, and 79% will have had an event by the age of 40. Untreated, mortality is reported to be in the range of 30% to 50% by the age of 30. In addition, a high proportion of sudden infant death is also thought to be due to severe arrhythmia-related events such as CPVT. Due to the association between exercise, stress and the onset of symptoms, there is a significant impact on the activities of daily living of patients, their families and their caregivers, as any stressful event or activity may trigger an episode, creating considerable anxiety for the patients and their family members. Despite major electrophysiological abnormality, patients with CPVT have a structurally normal heart and a normal baseline electrocardiogram (ECG). However, during a cardiac stress test, such as an exercise test on a treadmill, patients with CPVT display a distinct “polymorphic” ventricular tachycardia on ECG that makes clinical diagnosis straightforward.
 Limitations of Current Therapy for CPVT
 Despite available therapies to treat CPVT, which include beta-blockers and the sodium channel blocker flecainide, it is estimated that 30% to 40% of patients still experience significant cardiac events. Patients unresponsive to available therapies may be candidates for implantation of cardiac defibrillators, though their safety and effectiveness is considerably more limited in young patients. Due to the limitations of existing therapies, there remains a significant unmet medical need for patients with CPVT.
 AT307 Description
 AT307 consists of an AAV8 vector that is designed to deliver a functional CASQ2 gene and to increase CASQ2 protein expression in targeted tissues. We are utilizing AAV8 because it is known to effectively penetrate heart tissue. We believe AT307 has the potential to provide long-term clinical benefit to CASQ2-CPVT patients through persistent expression of the protein following a single administration, resulting in a significant reduction in life-threatening arrhythmic events and other disease symptoms.
 Preclinical Proof-of-Concept for AT307
 Initial preclinical proof-of-concept studies were conducted using an AT307 prototype product candidate in a genetically engineered murine model of CASQ2-CPVT. This mouse manifests stress-induced arrhythmias upon epinephrine administration, as well as cellular and molecular manifestations of the disease. In this model, a single 
 17


administration of the AT307 prototype to nine mice resulted in a significant improvement in CASQ2 protein expression to a level approaching that of normal animals. Cardiomyocytes isolated from animals with a CASQ2 mutation show abnormal electrophysiology, as demonstrated by pre-arrhythmic events such as increased delayed after depolarizations and triggered activity. Cardiomyocytes isolated from the affected mice treated with the AT307 prototype had electrophysiology indistinguishable from that of normal mice.
 Additionally, the efficacy of the AT307 prototype was evaluated in studies in both newborn and adult affected mice. In both studies treatment resulted in significant reductions in ventricular tachycardia versus untreated controls when challenged with epinephrine. The effect of this single treatment lasted for the one-year duration of the studies. 
 More recently, we conducted a dose ranging study with the proposed AT307 clinical construct in the murine model of CASQ2-CPVT.  In our study, a single tail vein injection at doses of 3.0x1013 vg/kg and 3.0x1014 vg/kg of AT307 significantly reduced the characteristic CASQ2 ventricular tachycardia four and twelve weeks after dosing, respectively.


Statistical significance is important and when used herein is denoted by p-values. The p-value is the probability that the reported result was achieved purely by chance (for example, a p-value < 0.001 means that there is a less than 0.1% chance that the observed change was purely due to chance). Generally, a p-value less than 0.05 is considered to be statistically significant.
 Planned Clinical Development of AT307
 We plan to submit an IND for AT307 in the first quarter of 2018, and to initiate a Phase 1/2 study in the fourth quarter of 2018. In this study, we plan to determine the safety of AT307 in patients with CASQ2-CPVT and to use the clear efficacy endpoint of an exercise electrocardiogram as a means to evaluate therapeutic benefit.
Regulatory Interactions
 We have held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA regarding our IND submission, and with the MHRA regarding our planned CTA submission. In addition, both the FDA and EMA have granted orphan drug designation to a prototype version of AT307, which we plan to update to reflect the final construct we intend to advance into clinical trials.

Manufacturing
 It is important to our business to ensure reliable, high quality clinical and commercial supply that is produced cost effectively. For these reasons, we have built and scaled a 38,000 square foot, state-of-the-art cGMP manufacturing plant in South San Francisco that has been designed and commissioned as a multi-product facility intended to support commercial licensure by both the FDA and EMA.  We currently manufacture all of our product candidates in-house, and our AAV process development and manufacturing teams continue to advance the science of AAV manufacturing through the development and implementation of novel production technologies. We view our internal manufacturing capability as a key competitive advantage as it allows for better control over product development timelines, costs and intellectual property, such as trade secrets, novel inventions and proprietary knowledge. Our process development and manufacturing teams are composed of a combination of industry veterans and established key opinion leaders in the field of AAV manufacturing. In addition to our cGMP manufacturing capability, we have established robust in-house process and analytical development operations to help ensure the long-term scalability and quality of our manufacturing operations.
 Our manufacturing strategy focuses on utilizing mammalian cells as the substrate for AAV-based product candidates. Mammalian cells are the natural host for AAV, and so provide a cellular environment most closely mimicking that in which the virus normally replicates. We believe that matching the production host cell to the vector in this way best preserves the quality of the replication complexes responsible for synthesizing viral vector genomes and creating, assembling and filling viral vector capsids with those genomes. Our product candidates are manufactured using transient transfection, in which genetic components for vector production are supplied to cells during each manufacturing run.
 Our current production process utilizes HEK293 cells, which are the most commonly used host cell for AAV vector production. These cells are familiar to regulatory authorities and commercial cell culture media manufacturers, and take up foreign DNA robustly to produce high transient vector titers. Our early clinical stage production platform utilizes serum-free suspension cell culture of HEK293 cells and transient transfection of plasmids to produce AAV vectors in a scalable process. We believe this approach maximizes speed of development, product quality and regulatory compliance. Further, our analytical team utilizes the latest technologies for characterization of biological molecules to enable the creation of strict standards of quality and potency that we believe will differentiate our products from others in the field.
 As large scale gene therapy manufacturing remains a new discipline, we view our investment in the capacity to develop, manufacture and analyze AAV vectors as strategically important, and we expect it to yield intellectual property and know-how that benefits both our internal programs and the broader gene therapy field.
 Intellectual Property
 We have licensed numerous patents and patent applications and possess substantial proprietary know-how and trade secrets relating to our development programs and manufacturing capabilities. We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business by seeking, maintaining and defending our intellectual property, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of gene therapy. Additionally, we intend to rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan disease drug designations, data exclusivity and market exclusivity as well as patent term extensions, where available.
 We are heavily dependent on patented or proprietary technologies that we license from third parties. For additional information regarding these license agreements, see “—License and Collaboration Agreements.” We anticipate that we will require additional licenses to third-party intellectual property rights relating to our development programs in the future, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
 Our in-licensed patents and patent applications are directed to the compositions of matter and methods of use related to various aspects of our product candidates as well as certain aspects of our manufacturing capabilities. As of December 31, 2017, we have one international patent application directed to modified AAV vectors and methods 
 19


of manufacturing the same. If granted, we expect that a U.S. patent claiming priority to this application would expire in 2036. Our in-licensed patent portfolio as it relates to one or more of our product candidates includes:
  
• | three U.S. patents relating to AT132, expiring in 2034, as well as one U.S. patent application, comprising claims directed to recombinant AAV for use in treating XLMTM and AAV constructs containing the MTM gene under control of the desmin promoter and uses thereof;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | one international patent application which, if granted as a U.S. patent, would be projected to expire in 2036, comprising claims directed to recombinant AAV for use in treating Crigler-Najjar and AAV constructs containing a codon-optimized UGT1A1 gene;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | five U.S. patents, expiring between 2022 and 2024, as well as corresponding patents and patent applications internationally, relating to recombinant AAV vectors having an AAV8 capsid utilized in AT132, AT342, and AT982;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | two U.S. patents relating to AT307, expiring in 2032, as well as one U.S. patent application, each with claims directed to methods of treating recessive CPVT by CASQ2 gene therapy; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | one U.S. patent, expiring in 2026, and three U.S. patent applications, as well as corresponding patents and patent applications internationally, relating to recombinant AAV vectors having an AAV9 capsid utilized in AT307.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The term of individual patents may vary based on the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective non- provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of an extended FDA regulatory review period. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date.
 In addition to patents and patent applications that we license, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of our AAV manufacturing capabilities and gene therapy technology are based upon trade secrets and know-how. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, and obtain and maintain ownership of certain technologies, in part, through confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how, including by implementing measures intended to maintain the physical security of our premises and the physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
 Our future commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to our licensed intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will issue with respect to any of the pending patent applications to which we license rights or with respect to any patent applications that we or our licensors may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our licensed patents or any patents that may be issued in the future to us or our licensors will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates and methods of manufacturing the same.
 Moreover, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for certain of our product candidates generally, as well as with respect to certain indications. See the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property.

Material License and Collaboration Agreements
 We have built our portfolio of product candidates in part by engaging in strategic transactions with third parties. We intend to continue to collaborate with additional third parties to expand our pipeline of product candidates, as well as to deepen our existing relationships with our collaborators and licensors. We intend to leverage these relationships to continue to advance the scientific understanding of the indications we target. We have in the past supported investigator-sponsored preclinical studies and clinical trials, and may do so in the future with our current and future collaborators.
 REGENXBIO License Agreement (XLMTM/Pompe)
 In July 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with REGENXBIO Inc. (formerly ReGenX Biosciences, LLC), or REGENXBIO. Under the agreement, REGENXBIO granted us an exclusive worldwide license under certain patent rights to make, have made, use, import, sell and offer for sale licensed products in the treatment of both XLMTM and Pompe disease using both AAV8 and AAV9.
 As consideration for the licensed rights, we paid REGENXBIO an initial fee of $0.3 million and 50,228 shares of our common stock. We also agreed to pay REGENXBIO (i) an annual maintenance fee; (ii) up to $8.85 million in combined milestone fees per licensed product related to XLMTM and up to $8.85 million in combined milestone fees per licensed product related to Pompe disease, a small portion of which may be paid in the form of shares of our common stock; (iii) mid to high single digit royalty percentages on net sales of licensed products and (iv) mid- single digit to low twenties royalty percentages of any sublicense fees we receive from sublicensees for the licensed patent rights.
 We are obligated to achieve certain development milestones, including submission to the FDA and subsequent effectiveness of an IND for each indication within a specified time period, which we may extend for additional time for a specified number of extensions upon the payment of a fee.
 The agreement will expire upon the expiration, lapse, abandonment or invalidation of the last claim of the licensed patent rights to expire, lapse or become abandoned or unenforceable in all countries worldwide. We may terminate the agreement upon prior written notice. REGENXBIO may terminate the agreement immediately if we or our affiliates become insolvent, if we are late by a specified number of days in paying money due under the agreement or if we or our affiliates commence any action against REGENXBIO or its licensors to declare or render any claim of the licensed patent rights invalid or unenforceable. Either party may terminate the agreement for material breach that is not cured within a specified number of days.
 REGENXBIO License Agreement (Crigler-Najjar Syndrome)
 In November 2015, we entered into a second license agreement with REGENXBIO. Under the agreement, REGENXBIO granted us an exclusive worldwide license under certain patent rights to make, have made, use, import, sell and offer for sale licensed products for the treatment of Crigler-Najjar syndrome in humans using AAV8.
 As consideration for the licensed rights, we paid REGENXBIO an upfront fee of $0.2 million and an additional $0.4 million upon our entry into the license and collaboration agreement with the University of Pennsylvania. We will also owe REGENXBIO (i) an annual maintenance fee; (ii) up to $7.6 million in combined development and regulatory milestone fees per licensed product; (iii) mid-single digit to low teens royalty percentages on net sales of licensed products sold by us, our affiliates and sublicensees and (iv) a low twenties percentage of certain sublicense fees we receive from sublicensees for the licensed products and certain fees we receive from the sale or transfer of specified rights related to a licensed product.
 21


Under the agreement, we are obligated to diligently use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, commercialize, market, promote and sell licensed products. We are also obligated to achieve certain development milestones, including submission to the FDA and subsequent effectiveness of an IND application, or acceptance by the European Medicines Agency of an equivalent application, within a specified time period, which we may extend for a specified number of extensions upon the payment of certain fees.
 The agreement will continue on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis and expire upon the later of the expiration, lapse, abandonment or invalidation of the last claim of the licensed patent rights to expire, lapse or become abandoned or unenforceable in such country, or ten years after first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. We may terminate the agreement upon prior written notice. REGENXBIO may terminate the agreement immediately in case of our bankruptcy, or other similar events, if we are late in paying money due under the agreement and do not pay in full within a specified number of days after receiving written notice, or if we or our affiliates commence any action against REGENXBIO or its licensors to declare or render any claim of the licensed patent rights invalid or unenforceable. Either party may terminate the agreement for material breach that is not cured within a specified number of days.
 REGENXBIO License Agreement (CPVT)
 In November 2015, we entered into a third license agreement with REGENXBIO. Under the agreement, REGENXBIO granted us an exclusive worldwide license under certain patent rights to make, have made, use, import, sell and offer for sale licensed products for the treatment of CPVT in humans using AAV9. Within a specified time and upon written notice we may elect to substitute for, or add to, CPVT certain other inherited arrhythmias.
 As consideration for the licensed rights, we paid REGENXBIO an upfront fee of $1.0 million. For each additional indication, we may elect to pursue under the licensed rights, we agreed to pay REGENXBIO a fee of $0.5 million upon such election. We also agreed to pay REGENXBIO (i) an annual maintenance fee for each covered indication; (ii) up to $8.8 million in combined development and regulatory milestone fees for each indication and each licensed product; (iii) up to $45.0 million in combined commercial milestone fees based on various annual aggregate net sales thresholds; (iv) mid-single digit to low teens royalty percentages on net sales of licensed products sold by us, our affiliates and sublicensees and (v) a low twenties percentage of any sublicense fees we receive from sublicensees for the licensed products and certain fees we receive from the sale or transfer of specified rights related to a licensed product.
 Under the agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, commercialize, market, promote and sell licensed products for each indication. We are also obligated to achieve certain development milestones for each indication, including submission to the FDA and subsequent effectiveness of an IND application, or acceptance by the European Medicines Agency of an equivalent application, within a specified time period, which we may extend for additional time and for a specified number of extensions upon the payment of certain fees.
 The agreement will continue on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis and expire upon the later of the expiration, lapse, abandonment or invalidation of the last claim of the licensed patent rights to expire, lapse or become abandoned or unenforceable in such country, or ten years after first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. We may terminate the agreement in its entirety or for each elected disease indication upon prior written notice. REGENXBIO may terminate the agreement immediately in the case of our bankruptcy, or other similar events, if we are late in paying money due under the agreement and do not pay in full within a specified number of days after receiving written notice, or if we or our affiliates commence any action against REGENXBIO or its licensors to declare or render any claim of the licensed patent rights invalid or unenforceable. Either party may terminate the agreement for material breach that is not cured within a specified number of days.

Genethon Collaborative Development Agreement
 In January 2014, we entered into a collaborative development agreement with Genethon, a French not-for-profit organization. Subject to certain limitations on patents that are co-owned or in-licensed by us, Genethon granted us a royalty-free, exclusive, worldwide license under certain background intellectual property rights controlled by Genethon to research, develop, make and commercialize certain products for the treatment of XLMTM. In addition, the collaboration agreement provides that new intellectual property arising from the performance of the development plan will be owned jointly by both parties and Genethon granted us a royalty-free, exclusive, worldwide license to Genethon’s interest in such new intellectual property to research, develop, make and commercialize certain products for the treatment of XLMTM. Genethon also granted us a right of first negotiation to negotiate rights to other internal research programs conducted by Genethon to research, develop, manufacture or commercialize other products for the treatment of XLMTM that are not already included within the scope of this agreement.
 In connection with the entry into the collaborative development agreement, we issued 262,396 shares of our common stock to Genethon, of which 87,465 shares vested immediately, 87,465 shares vested in January 2015 and 87,466 shares vested in January 2016. Genethon also received certain registration rights and information rights, similar to those held by our preferred stockholders.
 The agreement provides Genethon with the exclusive right to manufacture licensed product for preclinical and clinical purposes, subject to Genethon’s ability to supply required quantities in accordance with applicable timelines. Manufacturing costs will be paid by us. Under the agreement, we are obligated to fund Genethon’s research and development activities related to AT132. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we initiated internal manufacturing operations for licensed product during 2016.
 Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will stay in effect until completion of the research program and our license grants will survive any expiration of the agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach of the agreement or for the other party’s bankruptcy. We may terminate the agreement for convenience upon prior written notice. Genethon may terminate the agreement upon raising an objection to continued development on grounds of a safety or efficacy issue and upon prior written notice of such objection.
 ICSM (formerly FSM) License Agreement
 During the second quarter of 2017, we amended and restated our license agreement with Istituti Clinici Scientifici Maugeri S.p.A SB, or ICSM, the successor to Fondazione Salvatore Maugeri, or FSM. The amended and restated agreement is effective as of September 26, 2014, the date of the original license agreement. We had acquired the original license agreement through our acquisition of Cardiogen Sciences, Inc., or Cardiogen, in August 2015.
 As consideration for the original license agreement, Cardiogen issued 425,000 shares of Cardiogen common stock to FSM, the original licensor.  In connection with our acquisition of Cardiogen, the Cardiogen shares held by FSM were cancelled and converted into 51,968 shares of our common stock.
 Under the amended and restated agreement, we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain intellectual property to develop, use and commercialize products.  The intellectual property licensed to us under the amended and restated agreement primarily relates to CPVT.  In addition, any intellectual property which may result from research which is to be conducted by Maugeri and sponsored by Audentes under a separate sponsored research agreement is automatically included within the licenses granted to us under the amended and restated agreement.  The initial focus of that sponsored research is dominant CPVT.  Under the amended and restated agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop at least one (1) product and, after receiving regulatory approval in a given country, commercialize that product in such country.
 We may terminate the amended and restated agreement for convenience upon prior written notice. Either party may terminate the agreement upon prior written notice for the uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party or the other party’s bankruptcy or liquidation.
 23


The amended and restated agreement provides for development milestone payments to ICSM totaling up to 0.6 million Euros and we agreed to pay ICSM a low single-digit royalty based on net sales of licensed products for as long as such product is covered by a valid claim of the licensed patents in the applicable country. In conjunction with the amended and restated agreement, we also entered into a sponsored research agreement with ICSM requiring an upfront payment of 0.4 million Euros and a minimum annual funding commitment for research of 0.3 million Euros per year.  If Audentes terminates the sponsored research agreement, we would have to pay ICSM a termination fee equal to such annual funding commitment.  As indicated above, any intellectual property which may result from research which is to be conducted by Maugeri and sponsored by Audentes under such sponsored research agreement is automatically included within the licenses granted to us under the amended and restated license agreement.  The sponsored research agreement also provides us with a right of first negotiation to sponsor research to be conducted by ICSM with respect to gene therapies for additional cardiac indications.
 University of Pennsylvania License and Collaboration Agreement
 In May 2016, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, or the University of Pennsylvania. Under the agreement, the University of Pennsylvania granted us an exclusive worldwide license under certain patent rights to research, develop, use, sell, offer for sale, have sold, make, have made and import licensed products for the treatment of Crigler-Najjar.
 As consideration for the licensed rights, we paid the University of Pennsylvania an upfront fee of $0.5 million, as well as $4.5 million for certain preclinical development activities. We are obligated to pay the University of Pennsylvania (i) up to an aggregate of $6.0 million for preclinical development activities agreed upon by both parties, subject to adjustment based on the work plan, which amount includes the $4.5 million that had been previously paid, (ii) up to an aggregate of $13.7 million in development, regulatory and net sales milestone payments for the first licensed product; (iii) low to mid-single-digit royalty percentages on tiered annual net sales of the licensed products sold by us, our affiliates or sublicensees and (iv) mid-single-digit to low double-digit percentages of any sublicense fees we receive from third parties for the grant of sublicenses to any licensed patent rights.
 Under the agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, pursue regulatory approval for, market and commercialize at least one licensed product. The University of Pennsylvania will be responsible for conducting preclinical development activities according to a work plan, including all IND- enabling non-clinical studies and research grade manufacturing. We will be responsible for regulatory strategy and operations, clinical development, cGMP manufacture and commercialization of the licensed products.
 The agreement will continue on a country-by-country basis and expire upon the later of the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights that covers the exploitation of such licensed patent rights in such country, or ten years after first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. We may terminate the agreement upon 60 days’ prior written notice. Either party may terminate the agreement for material breach that is not cured within a specified number of days.
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including the gene therapy field, are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We are aware of several companies focused on developing gene therapies in various indications as well as several companies addressing other methods for modifying genes and regulating gene expression. We may also face competition from large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, government agencies and public and private research institutions. The key competitive factors affecting the success of any approved product will include the efficacy, safety profile, method of administration, cost and level of promotional activity.
 For our product candidates, we are aware of the following competing efforts:
  
• | AT132 for XLMTM. Valerion Therapeutics, LLC is studying VAL-0620, a fusion protein consisting of an antibody linked to MTM1. Preclinical evaluation of this approach in the MTM1 murine model demonstrated improvements in both muscle structure and function, as reported in a 2013 publication.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 24


 
This program has not been reported by Valerion Therapeutics, LLC to have progressed to clinical development.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AT342 for Crigler-Najjar. The current standard of care is phototherapy, and upon disease progression, liver transplant. There are currently no products approved specifically for the treatment of Crigler-Najjar. Genethon, a French not-for-profit organization, is developing an AAV-UGT1A1 gene therapy for the treatment of Crigler-Najjar syndrome, and has announced plans to initiate clinical development. Promethera has received orphan drug designation from the FDA and European Commission for the treatment of Crigler-Najjar syndrome for HepaStem, a product that comprises heterologous human adult liver progenitor cells. Promethera previously completed a Phase 1/2 study that enrolled patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome or ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. No further development in Crigler-Najjar syndrome has been announced for HepaStem. Additionally, Alexion and Moderna are collaborating to develop a messenger RNA product candidate for the treatment of Crigler-Najjar, but Alexion has announced delays to the program while Moderna evaluates new formulations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AT982 for Pompe Disease. The current standard of care is ERT with recombinant GAA protein. Genzyme Corporation currently markets MYOZYME and LUMIZYME, which are ERTs for the treatment of Pompe disease. Multiple companies, including Genzyme Corporation, Amicus Therapeutics, Inc., Valerion Therapeutics, LLC and Oxyrane UK Limited are currently reported to be developing next generation ERT to treat Pompe disease. The furthest advanced of these is neoGAA from Genzyme Corporation. In addition, we are aware of three companies researching alternative gene therapy approaches to treating Pompe disease, including Spark Therapeutics, Inc., AVROBIO, Inc., and Actus Therapeutics, Inc. Of these, only Actus Therapeutics, Inc. is actively recruiting for a Phase 1 human clinical trial.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AT307 for CASQ2-CPVT. Patients with CASQ2-CPVT commonly receive nadolol or propranolol as first-line treatment, sometimes with the addition of a calcium channel blocker. Flecainide, a sodium channel blocker, and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, are also used in the treatment of CASQ2-CPVT. Although infrequent, refractory cases may receive a heart transplant. There are no known investigational therapies in development for CASQ2-CPVT.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do, such as larger research and development, clinical, marketing and manufacturing organizations. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any product candidates that we may develop. Competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market, if ever. Additionally, new or advanced technologies developed by our competitors may render our current or future product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing our product candidates against competitors.
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the EU extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Approval Process
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among 
 25


other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, except the section of the FDC Act which governs the approval of New Drug Applications, or NDAs. Biological products, such as our gene therapy products, are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, via a Biologics License Application, or BLA. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
 Biological product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including Good Laboratory Practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity in animals, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA regulations or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions if it believes that the patients are subject to unacceptable risk.
 Clinical trials to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the biologic into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with drug exposure, and to obtain early evidence of a treatment effect if possible. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication, determine optimal dose and regimen, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical effects and confirm efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the drug or biologic. In rare instances, a single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient where there is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease 
 26


with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
 In addition, the manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug.
 After completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing and distribution of the product may begin in the United States. The BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. The submission of most BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2,400,000 for Fiscal Year 2018. Under an approved BLA, the applicant is also subject to an annual program fee, currently exceeding $300,000 for each prescription product.  Beginning in Fiscal Year 2018, this annual program fee replaces the annual product and establishment fees. These fees typically increase annually. A BLA for a drug that has been designated as an orphan drug is not subject to an application fee, unless the BLA includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition.  Additionally, an approved orphan-designated drug is exempt from the annual program fee if the applicant and its affiliates had less than $50 million in gross worldwide revenue during the previous year. We have received orphan drug designation for all of our product candidates, and therefore, we expect to be exempt from these fees. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the Agency’s determination that it is adequately organized and sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals to complete the review of BLAs. Most applications are classified as Standard Review products that are reviewed within ten months of the date the FDA accepts the BLA for filing; applications classified as Priority Review are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA accepts the BLA for filing. A BLA can be classified for Priority Review when the FDA determines the biologic product has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority reviews may be extended by the FDA for three or more additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the BLA submission.
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel biologic products, or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to be reviewed by an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians, statisticians and other experts—for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the BLA should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the biologic is safe, pure, potent and effective in the claimed indication.
 After the FDA evaluates the BLA and completes any clinical and manufacturing site inspections, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the BLA submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application for approval. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing and distribution of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks to patients. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure a product’s safe use, or ETASU. An ETASU can include, but is not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing the product, dispensing the product only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient-specific registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy.
 27


Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved BLA, including changes in indications, product labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs.
 Additional Regulation for Gene Therapy Products
 In addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical trials involving the use of gene therapy. FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the CMC information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. For instance, FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe all surviving subjects who receive treatment using gene therapies in clinical trials for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a minimum 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire. FDA does not require the long-term tracking to be complete prior to its review of the BLA.
 In addition, if a gene therapy trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, a protocol and related documentation must be submitted to, and the study registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA. In addition, many companies and other institutions not subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH convenes the RAC, a federal advisory committee, to discuss selected protocols and informed consent documents that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA notifies the FDA of the RAC’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA website and may be accessed by the public.
 The NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, which includes information on gene therapy trials and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these trials.
 Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval
 The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of biologics that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new biologic product candidate may request that the FDA designate the product for a specific indication for Fast Track status concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND. The FDA must determine if the biologic product candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. Under the Fast Track program and FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a biologic product for a serious or life-threatening illness or condition that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint. A surrogate endpoint is an endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or is a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
 In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A biologic product candidate approved using a surrogate endpoint is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the beneficial effect on a clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct 
 28


required post-approval trials, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing trials, will allow the FDA to withdraw the approved biologic product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for biologic products approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of BLA with Fast Track designation before the application is complete. This is termed “rolling review” and is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the outstanding BLA information and the applicant pays the applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s performance goal for reviewing a BLA does not begin until the last section of the BLA is submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) Designation
 Established under the 21st Century Cures Act, the RMAT designation is an expedited program for the advancement and approval of regenerative medicine therapies that are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious condition and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates the potential to address unmet medical needs for life-threatening diseases or conditions. Similar to Breakthrough Therapy designation, the RMAT allows companies developing regenerative medicine therapies to work earlier, more closely, and frequently with the FDA, and RMAT-designated products may be eligible for priority review and accelerated approval. Regenerative medicine therapies include cell therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products, except for those regulated solely under section 361 of the PHS Act and Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 1271. In a November 2017 draft guidance document, the FDA stated that gene therapies, including genetically modified cells, that lead to a durable modification of cells or tissues, as well as combination products when the biological product component provides the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the combination product, may meet the definition of a regenerative medicine therapy. For product candidates that have received a RMAT designation, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens.
Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to biological products intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the biological product and its potential orphan disease use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product in the approved indication. During the seven-year marketing exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market a biological product containing the same active moiety for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A product can be considered clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biological product for the same disease or condition, or the same biological product for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA user fee.
 29


Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program
 Under the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, FDA may award a priority review voucher to the sponsor of an approved marketing application for a product that treats or prevents a rare pediatric disease.  The voucher entitles the sponsor to priority review of one subsequent marketing application.  
 A voucher may be awarded only for an approved rare pediatric disease product application.  A rare pediatric disease product application is an NDA or BLA for a product that treats or prevents a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years; in general, the disease must affect fewer than 200,000 such individuals in the U.S.; the NDA or BLA must be deemed eligible for priority review; the NDA or BLA must not seek approval for a different adult indication (i.e., for a different disease/condition); the product must not contain an active ingredient that has been previously approved by FDA; and the NDA or BLA must rely on clinical data derived from studies examining a pediatric population such that the approved product can be adequately labeled for the pediatric population.  Before NDA or BLA approval, FDA may designate a product in development as a product for a rare pediatric disease, but such designation is not required to receive a voucher.
 To receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, a sponsor must notify FDA, upon submission of the NDA or BLA, of its intent to request a voucher.  If FDA determines that the NDA or BLA is a rare pediatric disease product application, and if the NDA or BLA is approved, FDA will award the sponsor of the NDA or BLA a voucher upon approval of the NDA or BLA.  FDA may revoke a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher if the product for which it was awarded is not marketed in the U.S. within 365 days of the product’s approval.
 The voucher, which is transferable to another sponsor, may be submitted with a subsequent NDA or BLA and entitles the holder to priority review of the accompanying NDA or BLA.  The sponsor submitting the priority review voucher must notify FDA of its intent to submit the voucher with the NDA or BLA at least 90 days prior to submission of the NDA or BLA and must pay a priority review user fee in addition to any other required user fee ($2,830,579 in fiscal year 2018).  FDA must take action on an NDA or BLA under priority review within six months of receipt of the NDA or BLA.   
 The Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program was reauthorized in the 21st Century Cures Act, allowing a product that is designated as a product for a rare pediatric disease prior to October 1, 2020 to be eligible to receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher upon approval of a qualifying NDA or BLA prior to October 1, 2022.
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biological products, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on the website www.clintrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of a clinical trial are then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of clinical trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of clinical development programs as well as clinical trial design.
Pediatric Information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the biological product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product with orphan product designation except a product with a new active ingredient that is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and directed at a molecular target determined by FDA to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer that is subject to an NDA or BLA submitted on or after August 18, 2020.
 30


Additional Controls for Biologics
 To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend biologics licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases within the United States.
 After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the lot manufacturing history and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before allowing the manufacturer to release the lots for distribution. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of a BLA, biologics manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
 Patent Term Restoration
 After approval, owners of relevant biologic patents may apply for a patent term extension for a patent to include the regulatory review period. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase—the time from an IND application becoming effective to BLA submission—and all of the regulatory review phase—the time from BLA submission to approval, up to a maximum of five years of patent term restoration. The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with appropriate due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years from the date of FDA approval of the BLA.
 For patents that might expire during the BLA review phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug or biologic covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a biologic for which a BLA has not been submitted.
 Biosimilars
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, creates an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical trials, animal trials, and a clinical trial or trials, unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services waives a required element. A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a previously approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. To date a handful of biosimilar products and no interchangeable products have been approved under the BPCIA. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to biosimilar product implementation, which is still being evaluated by the FDA.
 A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure, or BLA approval, of the reference product, and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of 
 31


the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the biosimilar abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) 18 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is no patent challenge, (iii) eighteen months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar’s application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42- month period.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic safety summary reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, biological product manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects a biologic product’s manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with required regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the federal false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, recommending or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti- Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and/or formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
 32


Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below).
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 Federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses.
 HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements on certain types of people and entities relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. 
 33


An increasing number of states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to file periodic reports of expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states; make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities; price gouging; or pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing. In addition, states such as California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts required pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes.  All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 34


Healthcare Reform
 In March 2010, President Obama enacted the ACA, which has begun to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and has also begun to significantly impact the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. The ACA has impacted existing government healthcare programs and resulted in the development of new programs.
 Among the ACA provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs, that began in 2011;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the manufacturer’s subsidy under this program from 50% to 70% of the negotiated price, beginning in 2019;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals beginning in 2014 and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We anticipate that the ACA will result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Additional Regulation
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
 35


European Union and the Rest of the World Government Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a CTA much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and an IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the EU, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
