OVERVIEW, STRATEGIES AND COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
This section reflects our business strategies following the Transaction
Our Business 
Following the Transaction, we became one of the largest gatherers of natural gas, based on wellhead volumes, in the United States, and became the largest producer and marketer of NGLs in the United States. In 2016, we gathered, processed and transported an average of approximately 6.5 trillion Btus per day of natural gas and produced an average of approximately 393,000 barrels per day of NGLs. Our primary operations consist of: 

• | gathering, compressing, treating, processing natural gas and producing and fractionating NGLs; and


• | logistics and marketing, from which we generate revenues primarily by trading, transporting, storing and marketing natural gas and NGLs, fractionating NGLs, and recovering and selling condensate.

The diagram below depicts our organizational structure as of January 1, 2017 following the Transaction. 
We operate in 17 states in the United States. Our gathering systems and processing plants are connected to several interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines. We also operate various NGL pipeline systems, one NGL and one natural gas storage facility. Following the consummation of the Transaction, our gathering systems consisted of approximately 64,000 
2

miles of gathering and transmission pipeline owned or operated by us. We receive natural gas from a diverse group of producers under contracts with varying durations, and we receive fees or commodities from the producers to transport the natural gas from the wellhead to the processing plant. 
Following the consummation of the Transaction, we own or operate 61 natural gas processing plants. We also own an interest in one additional plant through our 40% equity interest in Discovery Producer Services, LLC. At some of these facilities, we fractionate NGLs into individual components (ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline). We receive fees or commodities as payment for our natural gas processing services, depending on the types of contracts we enter into with each supplier. 
We purchase or take custody of substantially all of our natural gas from producers, principally under three types of processing contracts: fee-based contracts; percent-of-proceeds/index contracts; and keep-whole and wellhead purchase arrangements. 
Based on our contracts, we have a long position in NGLs, natural gas and condensate and are sensitive to changes in commodity prices. Our operations of gathering, processing, compressing, transporting and storing natural gas, and the related operations of fractionating, transporting, storing and marketing of NGLs, create commodity price risk due to market fluctuations in commodity prices, primarily with respect to the prices of NGLs, natural gas and crude oil. You should read Item 1A. Risk Factors for risks associated with our business. Our business is dependent upon commodity prices and market demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, which are beyond our control and have been, and may continue to be, volatile. 
Our strategies for managing this commodity exposure and the related earnings and cash flow volatility include the following: 

• | A significant portion of our income is generated from fee-based contracts.


• | We have negotiated terms in our percent-of-proceeds and keep-whole contracts that provide us with downside protection. These terms include volume tiers, pricing floors and provisions that reduce the likelihood that we would be required to operate at an economic loss.


• | We have a hedging program where we enter into derivative financial instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk of weakened natural gas, NGL and condensate prices associated with our gathering, processing and sales activities, thereby stabilizing our cash flows. The commodity derivative instruments used for our hedging program are a combination of direct NGL product, crude oil, and natural gas hedges.

We sell NGLs to a variety of customers ranging from large, multi-national petrochemical and refining companies to small regional retail propane distributors. Substantially all of our NGL sales are made at market-based prices, including approximately 27% of our NGL production which was committed to Phillips 66 and Chevron Phillips Chemical, or CPChem as of December 31, 2016, the primary production commitment of which began a ratable wind down period in December 2014 and expires in January 2019. We anticipate continuing to purchase and sell commodities with Phillips 66 and CPChem in the ordinary course of business.
We sell the residual natural gas (primarily methane) that results from processing natural gas, to marketers and end-users at market-based prices. End-users include large industrial companies, natural gas distribution companies and electric utilities. We market residue gas and NGLs through our wholly-owned marketing company. We also have storage capacity for residue gas of approximately 12 Bcf at our Spindletop natural gas storage facility. 
Our Business Strategy 
Our primary business objectives are to achieve sustained company profitability, a strong balance sheet and profitable growth thereby sustaining our cash distribution per unit. We intend to accomplish these objectives by prudently executing the following business strategies:
Improve Operational Performance. We believe our operating efficiency and reliability enhance our ability to attract new natural gas supplies by enabling us to offer more competitive terms, services and service flexibility to producers. We believe we have a complementary base of assets from which to further extract operating efficiencies, while continuing to provide superior customer service. 
Contract Realignment. Through our contract realignment initiatives, we have grown our fee-based asset base. Under these fee-based arrangements, we receive a fee or fees for one or more of the following services: gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting or storing natural gas and fractionating, storing and transporting NGLs. The revenues we earn are directly related to the volume of natural gas or NGLs that flows through our systems and are not directly dependent on 
3

commodity prices. However, to the extent a sustained decline in commodity prices results in a decline in volumes, our revenues from these arrangements would be reduced. 
Targeted Growth. We intend to use our strategic asset base in the United States and our position as one of the largest gatherers of natural gas, and as the largest producer and marketer of NGLs in the United States, as a platform for future growth. We plan to grow our business by constructing new gathering lines, processing facilities and NGL pipeline infrastructure, and expanding existing infrastructure. 
Pursue strategic third party acquisitions. We pursue economically attractive and strategic acquisition opportunities within the midstream energy industry, both in new and existing lines of business, and geographic areas of operation. 
Our Competitive Strengths 
We believe that we are well positioned to execute our business strategies and achieve one of our primary business objectives of sustaining our cash distribution per unit because of the following competitive strengths:
Strategically Located Gas Gathering and Processing Operations.  Our assets are strategically located in areas with the potential for increasing our volume throughput and cash flow generation. We have operations in some of the largest natural gas producing regions in the United States: Permian Basin, Rocky Mountains, Midcontinent, Gulf Coast, East Texas, South Texas, Central Texas, and Antrim Shale. In addition, we operate one of the largest portfolios of natural gas processing plants in the United States. We provide an integrated package of logistics and marketing services to natural gas producers. We believe our ability to provide all of these services gives us an advantage in competing for new supplies of natural gas because we can provide substantially all services that producers, marketers and others require to move natural gas and NGLs from wellhead to market on a cost-effective basis. Our gathering systems and processing plants are connected to several natural gas pipeline systems. 
Integrated Logistics and Marketing Operations. We have connected our gathering and processing operations with more than 4,600 miles of NGL pipelines. This infrastructure offers our customers a competitive, integrated midstream service. We have strategically located NGL transportation pipelines in the Midcontinent, Rocky Mountains, East Texas, Gulf Coast, South Texas, Central Texas, and Permian Basin which are major NGL producing regions, NGL fractionation facilities in the Gulf Coast and an NGL storage facility in Michigan. Our NGL pipelines connect to various natural gas processing plants and transport the NGLs to large fractionation facilities, a petrochemical plant, a third party underground NGL storage facility and other markets along the Gulf Coast. Our NGL storage facility in Michigan is strategically adjacent to the Sarnia, Canada refinery and petrochemical corridor. We believe the strategic location of our assets coupled with their geographic diversity and our reputation for running our business reliably and effectively, presents us with continuing opportunities to provide competitive services to our customers and attract new natural gas production.
Stable cash flows. Our operations consist of a mix of fee-based and commodity-based services, which together with our commodity hedging program, are intended to generate relatively stable cash flows. Growth in our fee-based earnings will reduce the impact of unhedged margins and allow us to continue to generate relatively stable cash flows. Additionally, while certain of our gathering and processing contracts subject us to commodity price risk, we have mitigated a portion of our currently anticipated commodity price risk associated with the equity volumes from our gathering and processing operations with fixed price commodity swaps, settling through the first quarter of 2018.
Established Relationships with Oil, Natural Gas and Petrochemical Companies. We have long-term relationships with many of our suppliers and customers, and we expect that we will continue to benefit from these relationships. 
Experienced Management Team. Our senior management team and board of directors have extensive experience in the midstream industry. We believe our management team has a proven track record of enhancing value through organic growth and the acquisition, optimization and integration of midstream assets.
Affiliation with DCP Midstream, LLC and its owners. Our relationship with DCP Midstream, LLC and its owners, Phillips 66 and Spectra Energy, should continue to provide us with significant business opportunities. Through our relationship with DCP Midstream, LLC and its owners, we believe our strong commercial relationships throughout the energy industry, including with major producers of natural gas and NGLs in the United States, will help facilitate the implementation of our strategies. 
DCP Midstream, LLC has a significant interest in us through its ownership of an approximately 2% general partner interest, a 36% limited partner interest and all of our incentive distribution rights.

Midstream Natural Gas Industry Overview (Natural Gas Services and Logistics and Marketing)
General
The midstream natural gas industry is the link between exploration and production of natural gas and the delivery of its components to end-use markets, and consists of the gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting, storing and selling of natural gas, and producing, fractionating, transporting, storing and selling NGLs.
Once natural gas is produced from wells, producers then seek to deliver the natural gas and its components to end-use markets. The following diagram illustrates the natural gas gathering, processing, fractionation, storage and transportation process, which ultimately results in natural gas and its components being delivered to end-users.
Natural Gas Gathering
The natural gas gathering process begins with the drilling of wells into gas-bearing rock formations. Once the well is completed, the well is connected to a gathering system. Onshore gathering systems generally consist of a network of small diameter pipelines that collect natural gas from points near producing wells and transport it to larger pipelines for further transmission.
Natural Gas Compression
Gathering systems are generally operated at design pressures that will maximize the total throughput from all connected wells. Since wells produce at progressively lower field pressures as they deplete, it becomes increasingly difficult to deliver the remaining lower pressure production from the well against the prevailing gathering system pressures. Natural gas compression is a mechanical process in which a volume of wellhead gas is compressed to a desired higher pressure, allowing gas to flow into a higher pressure downstream pipeline to be brought to market. Field compression is typically used to lower the pressure of a gathering system or to provide sufficient pressure to deliver gas into a higher pressure downstream pipeline. If field compression is not installed, then the remaining natural gas in the ground will not be produced because it cannot overcome the higher gathering system pressure. In contrast, if field compression is installed, then a well can continue delivering production that otherwise would not be produced.
5

Natural Gas Processing 
The principal component of natural gas is methane, but most natural gas produced at the wellhead also contains varying amounts of NGLs including ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane and natural gasoline. NGLs have economic value and are utilized as a feedstock in the petrochemical and oil refining industries or directly as heating, engine or industrial fuels. Long-haul natural gas pipelines have residue natural gas specifications as to the maximum NGL content of the gas to be shipped. In order to meet quality standards for long-haul pipeline transportation, natural gas collected at the wellhead through a gathering system may need to be processed to separate hydrocarbon liquids from the natural gas that may have higher values as NGLs. NGLs are typically recovered by cooling the natural gas until the NGLs become separated through condensation. Cryogenic recovery methods are processes where this is accomplished at temperatures lower than negative 150°F. These methods provide higher NGL recovery yields. 
In addition to NGLs, natural gas collected at the wellhead through a gathering system may also contain impurities, such as water, sulfur compounds, nitrogen or helium, which must also be removed to meet the quality standards for long-haul pipeline transportation. As a result, gathering systems and natural gas processing plants will typically provide ancillary services prior to processing such as dehydration, treating to remove impurities and condensate separation. Dehydration removes water from the natural gas stream, which can form ice when combined with natural gas and cause corrosion when combined with carbon dioxide or hydrogen sulfide. Natural gas with a carbon dioxide or hydrogen sulfide content higher than permitted by pipeline quality standards requires treatment with chemicals called amines at a separate treatment plant prior to processing. Condensate separation involves the removal of liquefied hydrocarbons from the natural gas stream. Once the condensate has been removed, it may be stabilized for transportation away from the processing plant via truck, rail, or pipeline. 
Natural Gas and NGL Transportation and Storage
After gas collected through a gathering system is processed to meet quality standards required for transportation and NGLs have been extracted from natural gas, the residue natural gas is shipped on long-haul pipelines or injected into storage facilities. The NGLs are typically transported via NGL pipelines or trucks to a fractionator for separation of the NGLs into their individual components. Natural gas and NGLs may be held in storage facilities to meet future seasonal and customer demands. Storage facilities can include marine, pipeline and rail terminals, and underground facilities consisting of salt caverns and aquifers used for storage of natural gas and various liquefied petroleum gas products including propane, mixed butane, and normal butane. Rail, truck and pipeline connections provide varying ways of transporting natural gas and NGLs to and from storage facilities.
Natural Gas Asset Based Trading and Marketing
Natural gas storage and pipeline assets are exposed to certain risks including changes in commodity prices. Commodity price risk related to gas storage and pipeline assets can be managed through commodity derivative hedging programs. The commercial activities related to gas storage and pipeline assets primarily consist of the purchase and sale of natural gas and associated time spreads and basis spreads. A time spread transaction is executed by establishing a long gas position at one point in time and establishing an equal short gas position at a different point in time. Time spread transactions allow a locked in margin supported by the injection, withdrawal, and storage capacity of natural gas storage assets. Basis spread transactions are executed to mitigate the risk of sale and purchase price differentials across a system. A basis spread transaction allows a locked in margin on physical purchases and sales of gas, including injections and withdrawals from storage. Swaps may be used to execute these transactions.
NGL Trading
NGL trading activity includes trading energy related products and services through the use of fixed forward sales and purchases, basis and spread trades, storage opportunities, put/call options, term contracts and spot market trading. These energy trading operations are exposed to market variables and commodity price risk with respect to these products and services, and these operations may enter into physical contracts and financial instruments with the objective of realizing a positive margin from the purchase and sale of commodity-based instruments. 
Wholesale Propane Logistics
Wholesale propane logistics covers the receipt of propane from processing plants, fractionation facilities and crude oil
refineries, the transportation of that propane by pipeline, rail or ship to terminals and storage facilities, the storage of propane
and the delivery of propane to distributors. Propane is extracted from the natural gas stream at processing plants, separated from NGLs at fractionation facilities or separated from crude oil during the refining process. Propane demand is typically highest in 
6

suburban and rural areas where natural gas is not readily available, such as the Northeastern United States. Propane demand is typically highest in the winter heating season months of October through April.
OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS
The following sections reflect our Natural Gas Services, NGL Logistics and Wholesale Propane Logistics business segments prior to the Transaction and are intended to provide operating context for the financial results for the year ended December 31, 2016 provided elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Our operations are organized into three business segments: Natural Gas Services, NGL Logistics and Wholesale Propane Logistics. A map representing the geographic location and type of our assets for each of these segments is set forth below. Additional maps detailing the individual assets can be found on our website at www.dcpmidstream.com. Our website and the information contained on that site, or connected to that site, are not incorporated by reference into this report.

Natural Gas Services Segment
General
Our Natural Gas Services segment consists of a geographically diverse complement of assets and ownership interests that provide a varied array of wellhead to market services for our producer customers. These services include gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting and storing natural gas, and fractionating NGLs. These assets are positioned in certain areas with active drilling programs and opportunities for organic growth. Our Natural Gas Services segment owns or operates assets in seven states in the continental United States: Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Michigan, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming. The assets in these states include our Eagle Ford system, our East Texas system, our DJ Basin system, our 40% limited liability company interest in the Discovery system located offshore and onshore in Southern Louisiana, our Southeast Texas system, our Michigan system, our Southern Oklahoma system, our Wyoming system, and our 75% operating interest in the Piceance system. This geographic diversity helps to mitigate our natural gas supply risk in that we are not tied to one natural 
8

gas resource type or producing area. We believe our current geographic mix of assets will be an important factor for maintaining overall volumes and cash flow for this segment.
During 2016, the volume throughput on our assets was in excess of 2.4 Bcf/d, originating from a diversified mix of customers. Our systems each have significant customer acreage dedications that will continue to provide opportunities for growth as those customers execute their drilling plans over time. Our gathering systems also attract new natural gas volumes through numerous smaller acreage dedications and also by contracting with undedicated producers who are operating in or around our gathering footprint. During 2016, the combined NGL production from our processing facilities was approximately 155,000 Bbls/d and was delivered and sold into various NGL takeaway pipelines or transported by truck. 
Our natural gas systems have the ability to deliver gas into numerous downstream transportation pipelines and markets. Many of our outlets transport gas to premium markets in the eastern United States, further enhancing the competitiveness of our commercial efforts in and around our natural gas gathering systems.

Our Eagle Ford system is a fully integrated midstream business in Fayette, Goliad, Jackson, Jim Wells, Lavaca, Live Oak and Nueces counties in Texas which includes gathering systems, production from 900,000 acres supported by acreage dedications or throughput commitments under long-term predominantly percent-of-proceeds agreements, cryogenic natural gas processing plants and fractionation facilities. 
Our East Texas system located near Carthage, Texas, includes a natural gas processing complex that is connected to its gathering system, as well as third party gathering systems, which gathers, transports, compresses, treats and processes natural gas and NGLs. Our East Texas facility may also fractionate NGLs, which can be marketed at nearby petrochemical facilities. 
Our DJ Basin system consists of three gas processing plants in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, or DJ Basin, in Weld County, Colorado. Our DJ Basin system also connects to DCP Midstream, LLC plants and gathering systems and delivers NGLs to the Wattenberg, Front Range and Texas Express pipelines in our NGL Logistics segment. In the first quarter of 2016, we completed construction on our Grand Parkway gathering system.
We have a 40% interest in Discovery Producer Services LLC, or Discovery, with the remaining 60% owned by Williams Partners L.P. The Discovery system is operated by Williams Partners L.P. and offers a full range of wellhead-to-market services to both onshore and offshore natural gas producers. The assets are primarily located in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and Lafourche Parish, Louisiana. The Keathley Canyon Connector extension, is supported by long-term fee-based agreements with the Lucius and Hadrian South owners, as well as the Heidelberg and Hadrian North owners, for natural gas gathering, transportation and processing services for production from those fields. In addition, the pipeline system is in proximity to other high-potential deepwater Gulf of Mexico discoveries and prospects.

The following systems are included in Other:
•Our Southeast Texas system;
•Our Michigan system;
•The Northern Louisiana system which was sold on July 1, 2016, and included in the 2016 operating data through the period of ownership; 
•Our Southern Oklahoma system;
•Our Wyoming system; and
•Our 75% interest in our Piceance system.
Natural Gas and NGL Markets
The Eagle Ford system has natural gas residue outlets including interstate and intrastate pipelines. The system delivers NGLs to the Gulf Coast petrochemical markets and to Mont Belvieu through our Sand Hills pipeline, owned approximately one-third each by us, DCP Midstream, LLC and Phillips 66, and other third party NGL pipelines. Our Eagle plant has delivery options into the Trunkline and Transco gas pipeline systems. 
The East Texas system delivers gas primarily through its Carthage Hub which delivers residue gas to multiple interstate and intrastate pipelines. Certain of the lighter NGLs, consisting of ethane and propane, are fractionated at the East Texas facility and sold to regional petrochemical purchasers. The remaining NGLs, including butanes and natural gasoline, are purchased by DCP Midstream, LLC and transported to Mont Belvieu for fractionation and sale.
The DJ Basin system delivers to the Conway hub in Bushton, Kansas via our Wattenberg pipeline and to the Mont Belvieu hub in Mont Belvieu, Texas via the Front Range and Texas Express pipelines in our NGL Logistics segment. 
The Discovery assets have access to downstream pipelines and markets. The NGLs are fractionated, then delivered downstream to third-party purchasers consisting of a mix of local petrochemical facilities and wholesale distribution companies as well as pipelines that transport product to the storage and distribution center near Napoleonville, Louisiana or other similar product hubs.
Customers and Contracts
The suppliers of natural gas to our Natural Gas Services segment are a broad cross-section of the natural gas producing community. We actively seek new producing customers of natural gas on all of our systems to increase throughput volume and to offset natural declines in the production from connected wells. We obtain new natural gas supplies in our operating areas by contracting for production from new wells, by connecting new wells drilled on dedicated acreage and by obtaining natural gas that has been directly received or released from other gathering systems. 
Our contracts with our producing customers in our Natural Gas Services segment are a mix of commodity sensitive percent-of-proceeds and percent-of-liquids contracts and non-commodity sensitive fee-based contracts. Our gross margin generated from percent-of-proceeds contracts is directly related to the price of natural gas, NGLs and condensate and our gross margin generated from percent-of-liquids contracts is directly related to the price of NGLs and condensate. Additionally, these contracts may include fee-based components. Generally, the initial term of these purchase agreements is for three to five years or, in some cases, the life of the lease. As we negotiate new agreements and renegotiate existing agreements, this may result in a change in contract mix period over period. The largest percentage of volume at our Southern Oklahoma and Eagle Ford systems are processed under percent-of-proceeds contracts. The producer contracts at our East Texas and Southeast Texas systems are a combination of percent-of-proceeds and fee-based contracts. The majority of the contracts for our Piceance, DJ Basin and Michigan systems are fee-based. The DJ Basin system has in place a long-term fee-based processing agreement with DCP Midstream, LLC which provides us with a fixed demand charge on a portion of the plants' capacities and a throughput fee on all volumes processed. Our Wyoming system has a combination of percent-of-proceeds and fee-based contracts. Discovery has percent-of-liquids, fee-based and keep-whole contracts. 
Discovery’s 100% owned subsidiary, Discovery Gas Transmission, owns the mainline and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, regulated laterals, which generate revenues through a tariff on file with FERC for several types of service: traditional firm transportation service with reservation fees; firm transportation service on a commodity basis with reserve dedication; and interruptible transportation service. In addition, for any of these general services, Discovery Gas 
10

Transmission has the authority to negotiate a specific rate arrangement with an individual shipper and has several of these arrangements currently in effect.
Competition
The natural gas services business is highly competitive in our markets and includes major integrated oil and gas companies, interstate and intrastate pipelines, and companies that gather, compress, treat, process, transport, store and/or market natural gas. Competition is often the greatest in geographic areas experiencing robust drilling by producers and during periods of high commodity prices for crude oil, natural gas and/or NGLs. Competition is also increased in those geographic areas where our commercial contracts with our customers are shorter term and therefore must be renegotiated on a more frequent basis.
11

NGL Logistics Segment 
General
We own and operate assets for our NGL Logistics business in the states of Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Oklahoma and Texas, which are major NGL producing regions.
12

Our NGL pipelines transport NGLs from natural gas processing plants to fractionation facilities, a petrochemical plant and a third party underground NGL storage facility. Our pipelines provide transportation services to customers primarily on a fee basis. Therefore, the results of operations for this business are generally dependent upon the volume of product transported and the level of fees charged to customers. The volumes of NGLs transported on our pipelines are dependent on the level of production of NGLs from processing plants connected to our NGL pipelines. When natural gas prices are high relative to NGL prices, it is less profitable to recover NGLs from natural gas because of the higher value of natural gas compared to the value of NGLs. As a result, we have experienced periods, and will likely experience periods in the future, when higher relative natural gas prices reduce the volume of NGLs produced at plants connected to our NGL pipelines. 
Our NGL fractionation facilities in the DJ Basin, in Colorado, and our partially owned facilities in Mont Belvieu, Texas, separate NGLs received from processing plants into their individual components. The fractionation facilities provide services on a fee basis. Therefore, the results of operations for this business are generally dependent upon the volume of NGLs fractionated and the level of fees charged to customers.
Our NGL storage facility is located in Marysville, Michigan with strategic access to the Marcellus, Utica and Canadian NGLs. Our facility serves regional refining and petrochemical demand, and helps to balance the seasonality of propane distribution in the Midwestern and Northeastern United States and in Sarnia, Canada. We provide services to customers primarily on a fee basis. Therefore, the results of operations for this business are generally dependent upon the volume of product injected, stored and withdrawn, and the level of fees charged to customers.

DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC, or the Southern Hills pipeline, an interstate NGL pipeline in which we owned a 33.33% interest in 2016, and following the Transaction, we now own a 66.67% interest and operate the pipeline, which provides takeaway service from the Midcontinent to fractionation facilities at the Mont Belvieu, Texas market hub. 
Texas Express Pipeline LLC, or the Texas Express pipeline, an intrastate NGL pipeline in which we own a 10% interest, originates near Skellytown in Carson County, Texas, and extends to Enterprise Products Partners L.P.'s, or Enterprise, natural gas liquids fractionation and storage complex at Mont Belvieu, Texas. The pipeline also provides access to other third party facilities in the area. Enterprise is the operator of the pipeline.
The Wattenberg interstate NGL pipeline originates in the DJ Basin in Colorado and terminates near the Conway hub in Bushton, Kansas. The pipeline is connected to plants we acquired from DCP Midstream, LLC in the Transaction and our O'Connor plant in the DJ Basin. 
Front Range Pipeline LLC, or the Front Range pipeline, an interstate NGL pipeline in which we own a 33.33% interest, is a raw NGL mix pipeline that originates in the DJ Basin and extends to Skellytown, Texas. The Front Range pipeline connects to the O'Connor plant, Lucerne 1 plant and the Lucerne 2 plant, plants owned by DCP Midstream, LLC prior to the Transaction, and third party plants in the DJ Basin. Enterprise is the operator of the pipeline.
The Black Lake interstate NGL pipeline originates in northwestern Louisiana and terminates in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Black Lake receives NGLs from gas processing plants in northwestern Louisiana and southeastern Texas, including multiple third party plants, the Sand Hills pipeline and a third party storage facility. Black Lake delivers the NGLs it receives from these sources to fractionation plants in Mont Belvieu, Texas including our partially owned Enterprise and Mont Belvieu 1 fractionators as well as third party pipelines.
Panola Pipeline Company, LLC, or the Panola pipeline, an intrastate NGL pipeline in which we own a 15% interest, is an approximately 180-mile NGL pipeline system extending from points near Carthage, Texas to Mont Belvieu, Texas. Enterprise is the operator of the pipeline.
NGL Fractionation Facilities
We own a 12.5% interest in the Enterprise fractionator operated by Enterprise and a 20% interest in the Mont Belvieu 1 fractionator operated by ONEOK Partners, both located in Mont Belvieu, Texas. 
Our DJ Basin NGL fractionators in Colorado are located on processing plant sites that were owned and operated by DCP Midstream, LLC, prior to the Transaction, which delivers NGLs to the fractionators under a long-term fractionation agreement.
NGL Storage Facility
Our NGL storage facility is located in Marysville, Michigan and includes 11 underground salt caverns with approximately 8 MMBbls of storage capacity and rail, truck and pipeline connections providing an important supply point for refiners, petrochemical plants and wholesale propane distributors in the Sarnia, midwestern and northeastern markets.
Customers and Contracts
Our contracts with our customers in our NGL Logistics segment are primarily fee-based contracts.
In 2016, the Southern Hills, Sand Hills, Texas Express, and Front Range pipelines had long-term, fee-based, ship-or-pay transportation agreements in place with affiliates of DCP Midstream, LLC as well as third party shippers. These NGL pipelines collect fee-based transportation revenue under regulated tariffs.
The Wattenberg pipeline is an open access pipeline with access to numerous gas processing facilities in the DJ Basin. Prior to the Transaction, the Wattenberg pipeline was supported by a long-term dedication and transportation agreement with a subsidiary of DCP Midstream, LLC whereby certain NGL volumes produced at several of DCP Midstream, LLC’s processing facilities were dedicated for transportation on the Wattenberg pipeline. We collect fee-based transportation revenue under our tariff. 
DCP Midstream, LLC has historically been the largest active shipper on the Black Lake pipeline, accounting for approximately 66% of total throughput in 2016. The Black Lake pipeline generates revenue primarily through a FERC-regulated tariff.
DCP Midstream, LLC supplied certain committed NGLs to our DJ Basin NGL fractionators under fee-based agreements.
14

Our Marysville NGL storage facility serves wholesale propane customers, as well as refining and petrochemical customers, under one to three-year term storage agreements. Our revenues for this facility are primarily fee-based.
Competition
The NGL logistics business is highly competitive in our markets and includes interstate and intrastate pipelines, integrated oil and gas companies that produce, fractionate, transport, store and sell NGLs, and underground storage facilities. Competition is often the greatest in geographic areas experiencing robust drilling by producers and strong petrochemical demand and during periods of high NGL prices relative to natural gas. Competition is also increased in those geographic areas where our contracts with our customers are shorter term and therefore must be renegotiated on a more frequent basis.

Wholesale Propane Logistics Segment 
General
We own or operate assets for our wholesale propane logistics business in the states of Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Virginia. Our operations serve the large propane and other liquefied petroleum gas markets in the Northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and upper Midwestern states.
Due to our multiple propane supply sources, annual and long-term propane supply purchase arrangements, storage capabilities, and multiple terminal locations for wholesale propane delivery, we are generally able to provide our propane 
16

distribution customers with reliable, low cost deliveries and greater volumes of propane during periods of tight supply such as the winter months. We may also provide storage services to our customers for propane and other liquefied petroleum gases. We believe these factors generally result in our maintaining favorable relationships with our customers and allowing us to remain a supplier to many of the large distributors in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic United States. As a result, we serve as the baseload provider of propane supply to many of our propane distribution customers.
Pipeline deliveries to the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic markets in the winter season are generally at capacity and competing pipeline-dependent terminals can have supply constraints or outages during peak market conditions. Our system of terminals has excess capacity, which provides us with opportunities to increase our volumes with minimal additional cost.
Our Terminals
Our operations include one owned marine terminal, one owned propane pipeline terminal and six owned propane rail terminals, with a combined capacity of approximately 550 MBbls, and access to several open access pipeline terminals. Our owned marine terminal also has storage capabilities for other liquefied petroleum gases. We own our rail terminals and lease the land on which the terminals are situated under long-term leases, except for the York terminal where we own the land. Each of our rail terminals consist of two to three propane tanks that provide additional capacity for storage, and two high volume racks for loading propane into trucks. 
Propane Supply
Our wholesale propane business has a strategic network of supply arrangements under annual and multi-year agreements with index-based pricing. The remaining supply is purchased on month-to-month terms to match our anticipated sale requirements. Our primary suppliers of propane include a subsidiary of DCP Midstream, LLC, and MarkWest. We may also obtain supply from our NGL storage facility in Marysville, Michigan. 
For our rail terminals, we contract for propane at various major supply points in the United States and Canada, and transport the product to our terminals under long-term rail commitments, which provide fixed transportation costs that are subject to prevailing fuel surcharges. We also purchase propane supply from natural gas fractionation plants and crude oil refineries located in the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast. Through this process, we take custody of the propane and either sell it in the wholesale market or store it at our facilities. 
Based on the carrying value of our inventory, timing of inventory transactions and the volatility of the market value of propane, we have historically and may periodically recognize non-cash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, which occur when the market value of our commodities declines below our carrying value. 
Customers and Contracts
We typically sell propane to propane distributors under annual sales agreements, negotiated each spring, that specify floating price terms that provide us a margin in excess of our floating index-based supply costs under our supply purchase arrangements. In the event that a propane distributor desires to purchase propane from us on a fixed price basis, we may enter into fixed price sales agreements with terms of generally up to one year. We manage this commodity price risk by purchasing and storing propane, entering into physical purchase agreements or entering into offsetting financial derivative instruments with third parties that generally match the quantities of propane subject to these fixed price sales agreements. We believe that our ability to help our clients manage their commodity price exposure by offering propane at a fixed price may lead to improved margins and a larger customer base. We provide storage services for other liquefied petroleum gases on a fee basis under a multi-year agreement. Historically, the majority of the gross margin generated by our wholesale propane business is earned in the heating season months of October through April, which corresponds to the general market demand for propane.
We had two third-party customers in our Wholesale Propane segment that accounted for greater than 10% of our segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.
17

Competition
The wholesale propane business is highly competitive in the mid-Atlantic, upper Midwestern and Northeastern regions of the United States. Our wholesale propane business’ competitors include integrated oil and gas and energy companies, interstate and intrastate pipelines, as well as marketers and other wholesalers. 
Other Segment Information
For additional information on our segments, please see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
We have no revenue attributable to international activities.
REGULATORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The following section reflects our Regulatory and Environmental Matters existing subsequent to the Transaction
Safety and Maintenance Regulation 
We are subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation, or DOT, under the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended, or HLPSA, and comparable state statutes with respect to design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of pipeline facilities. HLPSA applies to interstate and intrastate pipeline facilities and the pipeline transportation of liquid petroleum and petroleum products, including NGLs and condensate, and requires any entity that owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with such regulations, to permit access to and copying of records and to file certain reports and provide information as required by the United States Secretary of Transportation. These regulations include potential fines and penalties for violations. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these HLPSA regulations.
We are also subject to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, or NGPSA, and the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of gas pipeline facilities while the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act establishes mandatory inspections for all United States oil and natural gas transportation pipelines in high-consequence areas within 10 years. DOT, through the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), has developed regulations implementing the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act that requires pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other safety protections in areas where the consequences of potential pipeline accidents pose the greatest risk to people and their property. 
Pipeline safety legislation enacted in 2012, the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011, (the Pipeline Safety and Job Creations Act) reauthorizes funding for federal pipeline safety programs through 2015, increases penalties for safety violations, establishes additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines, and requires studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines, including the expansion of integrity management, use of automatic and remote-controlled shut-off valves, leak detection systems, sufficiency of existing regulation of gathering pipelines, use of excess flow valves, verification of maximum allowable operating pressure, incident notification, and other pipeline-safety related requirements. New rules proposed by DOT’s PHMSA address many areas of this legislation. Extending the integrity management requirements to our gathering lines would impose additional obligations on us and could add material cost to our operations.
The Pipeline Safety and Job Creation Act requires more stringent oversight of pipelines and increased civil penalties for violations of pipeline safety rules. The legislation gives PHMSA civil penalty authority up to $200,000 per day per violation, with a maximum of $2 million for any related series of violations. Any material penalties or fines under these or other statutes, rules, regulations or orders could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.  
We currently estimate we will incur between $16 million and $20 million between 2017 and 2021 to implement integrity management program testing along certain segments of our natural gas transmission and NGL pipelines. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with the NGPSA and the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 and the Pipeline Safety and Job Creation Act.
States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety but may assume responsibility for enforcing intrastate pipeline regulations at least as stringent as the federal standards. In practice, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. We do not anticipate any significant problems in complying with applicable state laws and regulations in those states in which we or the entities in which we own an interest operate. Our natural gas transmission and 
18

regulated gathering pipelines have ongoing inspection and compliance programs designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety and pollution control requirements.
In addition, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers, both generally and within the pipeline industry. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We and the entities in which we own an interest are also subject to OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA Risk Management Program regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. The OSHA regulations apply to any process which involves a chemical at or above specified thresholds, or any process which involves flammable liquid or gas, pressurized tanks, caverns and wells in excess of 10,000 pounds at various locations. Flammable liquids stored in atmospheric tanks below their normal boiling point without the benefit of chilling or refrigeration are exempt from these standards. The EPA regulations have similar applicability thresholds. We have an internal program of inspection designed to monitor and enforce compliance with worker safety requirements. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.
Propane Regulation
National Fire Protection Association Codes No. 54 and No. 58, which establish rules and procedures governing the safe handling of propane, or comparable regulations, have been adopted as the industry standard in all of the states in which we operate. In some states these laws are administered by state agencies, and in others they are administered on a municipal level. With respect to the transportation of propane by truck, we are subject to regulations promulgated under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act. These regulations cover the transportation of hazardous materials and are administered by the DOT. The transportation of propane by rail is regulated by the Federal Railroad Administration. We conduct ongoing training programs to help ensure that our operations are in compliance with applicable regulations. We maintain various permits that are necessary to operate our facilities, some of which may be material to our propane operations. We believe that the procedures currently in effect at all of our facilities for the handling, storage and distribution of propane are consistent with industry standards and are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations.
FERC and State Regulation of Operations 
FERC regulation of interstate natural gas pipelines, the marketing and sale of natural gas in interstate commerce and the transportation of NGLs in interstate commerce may affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our products and services. Regulation of gathering systems and intrastate transportation of natural gas and NGLs by state agencies may also affect our business.
Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Regulation
Our Cimarron River, Discovery, and Dauphin Island Gathering Partners systems, or portions thereof, are some of our natural gas pipeline assets that are subject to regulation by FERC, under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, as amended, or NGA. Natural gas companies subject to the NGA may only charge rates that have been determined to be just and reasonable. In addition, FERC authority over natural gas companies that provide natural gas pipeline transportation services in interstate commerce includes:

• | certification and construction of new facilities;


• | abandonment of services and facilities;


• | maintenance of accounts and records;


• | acquisition and disposition of facilities;


• | initiation and discontinuation of transportation services;


• | terms and conditions of transportation services and service contracts with customers;


• | depreciation and amortization policies;


• | conduct and relationship with certain affiliates; and


• | various other matters.

19

Generally, the maximum filed recourse rates for an interstate natural gas pipeline's transportation services are based on the pipeline's cost of service including recovery of and a return on the pipeline’s actual prudent investment cost. Key determinants in the ratemaking process are costs of providing service, including an income tax allowance, allowed rate of return and volume throughput and contractual capacity commitment assumptions. The allocation of costs to various pipeline services and the manner in which rates are designed also can impact a pipeline's profitability. The maximum applicable recourse rates and terms and conditions for service are set forth in each pipeline’s FERC-approved gas tariff. FERC-regulated natural gas pipelines are permitted to discount their firm and interruptible rates without further FERC authorization down to the minimum rate or variable cost of performing service, provided they do not “unduly discriminate.”
Tariff changes can only be implemented upon approval by FERC. Two primary methods are available for changing the rates, terms and conditions of service of an interstate natural gas pipeline. Under the first method, the pipeline voluntarily seeks a tariff change by making a tariff filing with FERC justifying the proposed tariff change and providing notice, generally 30 days, to the appropriate parties. If FERC determines, as required by the NGA, that a proposed change is just and reasonable, FERC will accept the proposed change and the pipeline will implement such change in its tariff. However, if FERC determines that a proposed change may not be just and reasonable as required by NGA, then FERC may suspend such change for up to five months beyond the date on which the change would otherwise go into effect and set the matter for an administrative hearing. Subsequent to any suspension period ordered by FERC, the proposed change may be placed into effect by the company, pending final FERC approval. In most cases, a proposed rate increase is placed into effect before a final FERC determination on such rate increase, and the proposed increase is collected subject to refund (plus interest). Under the second method, FERC may, on its own motion or based on a complaint, initiate a proceeding to compel the company to change or justify its rates, terms and/or conditions of service. If FERC determines that the existing rates, terms and/or conditions of service are unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, then any rate reduction or change that it orders generally will be effective prospectively from the date of the FERC order requiring this change.
The natural gas industry historically has been heavily regulated; therefore, there is no assurance that a more stringent regulatory approach will not be pursued by FERC and Congress, especially in light of potential market power abuse by marketing companies engaged in interstate commerce. In the Energy Policy Act of 2005, or EPACT 2005, Congress amended the NGA and Federal Power Act to add anti-fraud and anti-manipulation requirements. EPACT 2005 prohibits the use of any “manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance” in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas, electric energy or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. FERC adopted market manipulation and market behavior rules to implement the authority granted under EPACT 2005. These rules, which prohibit fraud and manipulation in wholesale energy markets, are subject to broad interpretation. Given FERC's broad mandate granted in EPACT 2005, if energy prices are high, or exhibit what FERC deems to be "unusual" trading patterns, FERC may investigate energy markets to determine if behavior unduly impacted or "manipulated" energy prices.
In addition, EPACT 2005 gave FERC increased penalty authority for violations of the NGA and FERC's rules and regulations thereunder. FERC may issue civil penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation, and violators may be subject to criminal penalties of up to $1 million per violation and five years in prison. FERC may also order disgorgement of profits obtained in violation of FERC rules. FERC relies on its enforcement authority in issuing a number of natural gas enforcement actions. Failure to comply with the NGA and FERC's rules and regulations thereunder could result in the imposition of civil penalties and disgorgement of profits.
Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline Regulation
Intrastate natural gas pipeline operations are not generally subject to rate regulation by FERC, but they are subject to regulation by various agencies in the respective states where they are located. While the regulatory regime varies from state to state, state agencies typically require intrastate gas pipelines to provide service that is not unduly discriminatory and to file and/or seek approval of their rates with the agencies and permit shippers to challenge existing rates or proposed rate increases. For example, our Guadalupe system is an intrastate pipeline regulated as a gas utility by the Railroad Commission of Texas. To the extent that an intrastate pipeline system transports natural gas in interstate commerce, the rates and terms and conditions of such interstate transportation service are subject to FERC rules and regulations under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act, or NGPA. Certain of our systems are subject to FERC jurisdiction under Section 311 of the NGPA for their interstate transportation services. Section 311 regulates, among other things, the provision of transportation services by an intrastate natural gas pipeline on behalf of a local distribution company or an interstate natural gas pipeline. Under Section 311, rates charged for transportation must be fair and equitable, and amounts collected in excess of fair and equitable rates are subject to refund with interest. Rates for service pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA are generally subject to review and approval by FERC at least once every five years. Additionally, the terms and conditions of service set forth in the intrastate pipeline’s Statement of Operating Conditions are subject to FERC approval. Non-compliance with FERC's rules and regulations established under Section 311 of the NGPA, including failure to observe the service limitations applicable to transportation services provided under Section 311, failure to comply with the rates approved by FERC for Section 311 service, and failure to 
20

comply with the terms and conditions of service established in the pipeline’s FERC-approved Statement of Operating Conditions could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties. Among other matters, EPACT 2005 also amended the NGPA to give FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the NGPA up to $1 million for any one violation and violators may be subject to criminal penalties of up to $1 million per violation and five years in prison. 
Gathering Pipeline Regulation
Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of FERC under the NGA. We believe that our natural gas gathering facilities meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to FERC jurisdiction. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services continues to be a current issue in various FERC proceedings with respect to facilities that interconnect gathering and processing plants with nearby interstate pipelines, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by FERC and the courts. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental, and, in many circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation.
Our purchasing, gathering and intrastate transportation operations are subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which they operate. The ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply. These statutes have the effect of restricting our right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to purchase or transport natural gas.
Natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at both the state and federal levels where FERC has recognized a jurisdictional exemption for the gathering activities of interstate pipeline transmission companies and a number of such companies have transferred gathering facilities to unregulated affiliates. Many of the producing states have adopted some form of complaint-based regulation that generally allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to natural gas gathering access and rate discrimination. Our gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on our operations, but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.
Sales of Natural Gas
The price at which we buy and sell natural gas currently is not subject to federal regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation. However, with regard to our interstate purchases and sales of natural gas, and any related hedging activities that we undertake, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC and/or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC. Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, in additional to civil and criminal penalties, we could be subject to related third party damage claims by, among others, market participants, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.
Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of pipeline transportation. As noted above, the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry, most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies that remain subject to FERC jurisdiction. These initiatives also may affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas under certain circumstances. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these regulatory changes to our natural gas marketing operations.
Interstate NGL Pipeline Regulation
Certain of our pipelines, including Sand Hills and Southern Hills, are common carriers that provide interstate NGL transportation services subject to FERC regulation. FERC regulates interstate common carriers under its Oil Pipeline Regulations, the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, as amended, or ICA, and the Elkins Act of 1903, as amended. FERC requires that common carriers file tariffs containing all the rates, charges and other terms for services provided by such pipelines. The ICA requires that tariffs apply to the interstate movement of NGLs, as is the case with the Sand Hills, Southern Hills, Black Lake, Wattenberg and Front Range pipelines. Pursuant to the ICA, rates must be just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, and can be challenged at FERC either by protest when they are initially filed or increased or by complaint at any time they remain on file with FERC.
21

In October 1992, Congress passed EPACT, which among other things, required FERC to issue rules establishing a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for pipelines regulated by FERC pursuant to the ICA. FERC responded to this mandate by issuing several orders, including Order No. 561 that enables petroleum pipelines to charge rates up to their ceiling levels, which are adjusted annually based on an inflation index. Specifically, the indexing methodology requires a pipeline to adjust the ceiling level for its rates annually by the inflation index established by the FERC. FERC reviews the indexing methodology every five years, and in 2015, the indexing methodology for the five years beginning July 1, 2016 was changed to be the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods plus 1.23 percent. The previous five-year period utilized the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods plus 2.65 percent. Pipelines may charge up to the calculated ceiling level for their transportation rates, and typically adjust their rates July 1 annually, when the new inflation index and ceiling levels are calculated. Rate increases made pursuant to the indexing methodology are subject to protest, but such protests must show that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs from the previous year. If the indexing methodology results in a reduced ceiling level that is lower than a pipeline’s filed rate, the pipeline is required to reduce its rate to comply with the lower ceiling unless doing so would reduce a rate “grandfathered” under EPACT (see below) below the grandfathered level. A pipeline must, as a general rule, utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates. FERC, however, retained cost-of-service ratemaking, market-based rates, and settlement as alternatives to the indexing approach, which alternatives may be used in certain specified circumstances. Because of the change in indexing methodology effective July 1, 2016 and the trends in the producer price index, the ceiling levels calculated for our interstate NGL pipelines may be subject to decrease, which occurred in 2016 and resulted in the decrease in the tariff rates for many such pipelines.
EPACT deemed petroleum pipeline rates in effect for the 365-day period ending on the date of enactment of EPACT that had not been subject to complaint, protest or investigation during that 365-day period to be just and reasonable under the ICA. Generally, complaints against such “grandfathered” rates may only be pursued if the complainant can show that a substantial change has occurred since the enactment of EPACT in either the economic circumstances of the petroleum pipeline, or in the nature of the services provided, that were a basis for the rate. EPACT places no such limit on challenges to a provision of a petroleum pipeline tariff as unduly discriminatory or preferential.
On October 20, 2016, FERC issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which presented significant changes to the indexing mechanism and reporting requirements of common carriers subject to FERC’s jurisdiction under the ICA. The proposed changes to the indexing methodology, would prohibit an increase in a common carrier’s ceiling level and rates if a complaint was filed and the return as reported by the common carrier in two previous annual reports exceeded a predetermined threshold. Additionally, the FERC proposed multiple changes to its annual reporting requirements. We cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding, but the proposal, if implemented, could adversely impact future rate increases of our common carriers and place additional administration and reporting burdens on our business. 
Intrastate NGL Pipeline Regulation
NGL and other common carrier petroleum pipelines that provide intrastate transportation services are subject to regulation by various agencies in the respective states where they are located. While the regulatory regime varies from state to state, state agencies typically require intrastate petroleum pipelines to file tariffs and their rates with the agencies and permit shippers to challenge existing rates or proposed rate increases. For example, certain of our pipelines have tariffs filed with the Railroad Commission of Texas for their intrastate NGL transportation services.
Environmental Matters 
General
Our operation of pipelines, plants and other facilities for gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting, fractionating, storing or selling natural gas, NGLs and other products is subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the emission or discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.
As an owner or operator of these facilities, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:

• | requiring the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities and imposing obligations in those permits that reduce or limit impacts to the environment;


• | restricting the way we can handle or dispose of our wastes;

22


• | limiting or prohibiting construction or operational activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas inhabited by threatened and endangered species;


• | requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations; and


• | enjoining, or compelling changes to, the operations of facilities deemed not to be in compliance with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil, or potentially criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining or affecting future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict liability or joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances, or in some cases hydrocarbons, have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for property damage or personal injury allegedly caused by the release of substances or other waste products into the environment.
The trend in environmental regulations is to expand them, placing more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations, participate as applicable in the public process to ensure such new requirements are well founded and reasonable or to revise them if they are not, and to manage the costs of such compliance. We also actively participate in industry groups that help formulate recommendations for addressing existing or future regulations.
We do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. Below is a discussion of the more significant environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business. 
Impact of Air Quality Standards and Climate Change
A number of states have adopted or considered programs to reduce “greenhouse gases,” or GHGs, which can include methane, and, depending on the particular program or jurisdiction, we could be required to purchase and surrender allowances, either for GHG emissions resulting from our operations (e.g., compressor units) or from downstream combustion of fuels (e.g., oil or natural gas) that we process, or we may otherwise be required by regulation to take steps to reduce emissions of GHGs. Also, the EPA has declared that GHGs “endanger” public health and welfare, and is regulating GHG emissions from mobile sources such as cars and trucks. The EPA's 2010 action on the GHG vehicle emission rule triggered regulation of carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions from stationary sources under certain Clean Air Act programs at both the federal and state levels, particularly the Prevention of Significant Deterioration program and Title V permitting. These requirements for stationary sources took effect on January 2, 2011; however, in June 2014 the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision upholding these rules and struck down the EPA’s greenhouse gas permitting rules to the extent they impose a requirement to obtain a federal air permit based solely on emissions of greenhouse gases, but major sources of other air pollutants, such as volatile organic compounds or nitrogen oxides, could still be required to implement process or technology controls and obtain permits regarding emissions of greenhouse gases. The EPA proposed a rule in 2016 to comply with the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling by limiting the requirement to obtain permits addressing emissions of greenhouse gases to large sources of other air pollutants, such as volatile organic compounds or nitrogen oxides, which also emit 100,000 tons per year or more of CO2 equivalent (or modifications of these sources that result in an emissions increase of 75,000 tons per year or more of CO2). The EPA has also published various rules relating to the mandatory reporting of GHG emissions, including mandatory reporting requirements of GHGs from petroleum and natural gas systems. In October 2015, the EPA amended and expanded greenhouse gas reporting requirements to all segments of the oil and gas sector starting with the 2016 reporting year. In June 2016, the EPA published final new source performance standards for methane (a greenhouse gas) from new and modified oil and gas sector sources. These regulations expand upon the 2012 EPA rulemaking for oil and gas equipment-specific emissions controls, for example, regulating well head production emissions with leak detection and repair requirements, pneumatic controllers and pumps requirements, compressor requirements, and instituting leak detection and repair requirements for natural gas compressor and booster stations. In October 2015, the EPA finalized a reduction of the ambient ozone standard from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion under the Clean Air Act. The EPA also finalized in October 2016 Control Techniques Guidelines for emissions of volatile organic compounds from oil and gas sector sources to be implemented or utilized by states in ozone nonattainment areas, with an expected co-benefit of reduced methane emissions. The permitting, regulatory compliance and reporting programs, taken as a whole, increase the costs and complexity of oil and gas operations with potential to adversely affect the cost of doing business for our customers resulting in reduced demand for our gas processing and

transportation services, and which may also require us to incur certain capital and operating expenditures in the future to meet regulatory requirements or for air pollution control equipment, for example, in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions associated with our facilities and operations.
Hazardous Substances and Waste
Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, or solid or hazardous wastes, including petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and may impose strict liability or joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of areas at a facility where hazardous substances, or in some cases hydrocarbons, may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, or CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible parties the costs the agency incurs. Despite the “petroleum exclusion” of CERCLA Section 101(14), which encompasses natural gas, we may nonetheless handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment.
We also generate solid wastes, including hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Certain petroleum and natural gas production wastes are excluded from RCRA’s hazardous waste regulations. However, it is possible that these wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during our operations, may in the future be designated by the EPA as hazardous wastes and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses.
We currently own or lease properties where petroleum hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, petroleum hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under the other locations where these petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, certain of these properties may have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of petroleum hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control. These properties and wastes disposed or released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, or separate state laws that address hydrocarbon releases. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate releases of hydrocarbon materials, or previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), or to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. We are not currently aware of any facts, events or conditions relating to the application of such requirements that could reasonably have a material impact on our operations or financial condition.
Water
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also referred to as the Clean Water Act, or CWA, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. Pursuant to the CWA and analogous state laws, permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters. The CWA also requires implementation of spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as "SPCC plans," in connection with on-site storage of threshold quantities of oil or certain other materials. The CWA imposes substantial potential civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance. State laws for the control of water pollution also provide varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities. In addition, some states maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater. The EPA has promulgated regulations that require us to have permits in order to discharge certain storm water. The EPA has entered into agreements with certain states in which we operate whereby the permits are issued and administered by the respective states. These permits may require us to monitor and sample the storm water discharges. We believe that compliance with existing permits and compliance with foreseeable new permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, which is part of the Clean Water Act, addresses prevention, containment and cleanup, and liability associated with oil pollution. OPA applies to vessels, offshore platforms, and onshore facilities, including natural gas gathering and processing facilities, terminals, pipelines, and transfer facilities. OPA subjects owners of such facilities to strict liability for containment and removal costs, natural resource damages, and certain other consequences of oil spills into jurisdictional waters. Any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants from our operations could result in government penalties and civil liability. We are not currently aware of any facts, events or conditions relating to the application of such requirements that could reasonably have a material impact on our operations or financial condition.
Anti-Terrorism Measures
The federal Department of Homeland Security regulates the security of chemical and industrial facilities pursuant to regulations known as the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards. These regulations apply to oil and gas facilities, among others, that are deemed to present “high levels of security risk.” Pursuant to these regulations, certain of our facilities are required to comply with certain regulatory provisions, including requirements regarding inspections, audits, recordkeeping, and protection of chemical-terrorism vulnerability information.
