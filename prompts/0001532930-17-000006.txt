Item 1. | Business

We are a diversified oilfield services company that provides a wide range of wellsite services and equipment to U.S. land-based exploration and production (“E&P”) customers operating in unconventional resource plays. We offer services and equipment that are strategic to our customers’ oil and natural gas operations. Our services include drilling, hydraulic fracturing and oilfield rentals. Our operations are geographically diversified across many of the most active oil and natural gas plays in the onshore United States, including the Anadarko and Permian Basins and the Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Marcellus, Niobrara and Utica Shales.
Information About Us
We make available free of charge on our website at www.77nrg.com our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Patterson-UTI Merger Agreement
On December 12, 2016, SSE entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Pyramid Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Patterson-UTI (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Patterson-UTI will acquire SSE in exchange for newly issued shares of Patterson-UTI common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Patterson-UTI Common Stock”). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will be merged with and into SSE, with SSE continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Patterson-UTI (the “Merger”). The transaction is subject to approvals from each company’s stockholders, regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2017. However, SSE cannot predict with certainty when, or if, the pending merger will be completed because completion of the transaction is subject to conditions beyond the control of the Company. 
In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, certain affiliates of Axar Capital Management, LLC, BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC and Mudrick Capital Management, L.P. entered into voting and support agreements with Patterson-UTI, pursuant to which each such stockholder agreed to vote all of its shares of SSE common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and against, among other things, alternative transactions. As of February 9, 2017, those stockholders held and are entitled to vote in the aggregate approximately 59% of the issued and outstanding shares of SSE common stock entitled to vote at the SSE special meeting. In the event that SSE’s board of directors changes its recommendation that SSE stockholders adopt the merger agreement, such stockholders, taken together, will be required to vote shares that, in the aggregate, represent 39.99% of the issued and outstanding shares of SSE common stock on such proposal, with each such stockholder being able to vote the balance of its shares of SSE common stock on such proposal in such stockholder’s sole discretion.
For further information about the merger, see Note 2 “Patterson-UTI Merger Agreement” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.
Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11 Proceedings
On June 7, 2016, SSE and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for relief (the “Bankruptcy Petitions”) under Chapter 11 of the United States Code (“Chapter 11” or the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”), case number 16-11409. The Debtors continued to operate their business as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The subsidiary Debtors in these Chapter 11 cases were Seventy Seven Operating LLC (“SSO”), Seventy Seven Land Company LLC, Seventy Seven Finance Inc. (“SSF”), Performance Technologies, L.L.C., PTL Prop Solutions, L.L.C., Western Wisconsin Sand Company, LLC, Nomac Drilling, L.L.C., SSE Leasing LLC, Keystone Rock & Excavation, L.L.C. and Great Plains Oilfield Rental, L.L.C., which represent all subsidiaries of the Company. On July 14, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order (the “Confirmation Order”) confirming the Joint Pre-packaged Plan of Reorganization (as amended and supplemented, the “Plan”) of the Debtors. On 
1

August 1, 2016 (the “Effective Date”), the Plan became effective pursuant to its terms and the Debtors emerged from their Chapter 11 cases. For further information about the reorganization, see Note 3 “Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11 Proceedings and Related Events” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.
Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company adopted fresh-start accounting and became a new entity for financial reporting purposes. As a result of the application of fresh-start accounting and the effects of the implementation of the Plan, the Company’s consolidated financial statements on or after August 1, 2016 are not comparable with the financial statements prior to the Effective Date. The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contained herein relates to the five months ended December 31, 2016 (the “2016 Successor Period”), the seven months ended July 31, 2016 (the “2016 Predecessor Period”) and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. For additional information about the application of fresh-start accounting, see Note 4 “Fresh-Start Accounting” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.
Spin-Off
On June 30, 2014, we separated from CHK in a series of transactions, which we refer to as the “spin-off.” Prior to the spin-off, we were an Oklahoma limited liability company operating under the name “Chesapeake Oilfield Operating, L.L.C.” (“COO”) and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of CHK. As part of the spin-off, we converted to an Oklahoma corporation operating under the name “Seventy Seven Energy Inc.” All of the equity in our Company was distributed pro rata to CHK’s shareholders and we became an independent, publicly traded company. Please read “—The Spin-Off” for further discussion of the transactions in which SSE became an independent public company and the agreements we entered into with CHK in connection with the spin-off.
Our Operating Segments 
We conduct our business through three operating segments: Drilling, Hydraulic Fracturing and Oilfield Rentals. For financial information pertaining to our operating segments, please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 20 “Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Items 7 and 8, respectively, of this report.
Drilling 
Our drilling segment is operated through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Nomac Drilling, L.L.C., and provides land-based drilling services.
Drilling rig fleet. Our all-electric rig fleet, one of the largest in the industry, is categorized into two operational “Tiers.” All of our rigs are equipped with top drives. Our AC powered Tier 1 and DC powered Tier 2 rigs are predominantly equipped with 1,600 horsepower mud pumps. Approximately 79% of our rigs are multi-well pad capable, equipped with skidding or walking systems. 
As of December 31, 2016, our marketed rig fleet of 91 all-electric rigs consisted of 40 Tier 1 rigs, including 28 proprietary PeakeRigs™, and 51 Tier 2 rigs. Our PeakeRigs™ are designed for long lateral drilling of multiple wells from a single location, which makes them well-suited for unconventional resource development.
Drilling customers and contracts. Our customers, as operators of the wells that we service, engage us and pay our fees. These contracts provide for drilling services on a well-by-well basis or for a term of a certain number of days or a certain number of wells. As of December 31, 2016, all of our drilling contracts were daywork contracts. A daywork contract generally provides for a basic rate per day when drilling (the day rate for our providing a rig and crew) and for lower rates when the rig is moving, or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other certain conditions beyond our control. In addition, daywork contracts may provide for a lump-sum fee for the mobilization and demobilization of the rig, which in most cases approximates our incurred costs. Many of our drilling contracts are also subject to termination by the customer. Under certain of these contracts, we have agreed to allow customers to pay the termination cost over the life of the contract in lieu of a lump sum, and we refer to a rig in this circumstance as “idle but contracted” or “IBC.” IBC payments are structured to preserve our anticipated operating margins for the affected rigs through the end of the contract terms. 
2

Hydraulic Fracturing 
Our hydraulic fracturing segment is operated through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Performance Technologies, L.L.C. (“PTL”), and provides high-pressure hydraulic fracturing (or frac) services and other well stimulation services.
Hydraulic fracturing services. As of December 31, 2016, we own 13 hydraulic fracturing fleets with an aggregate of approximately 500,000 horsepower, and six of these fleets are contracted in the Anadarko Basin and the Eagle Ford Shale. Our equipment currently has an average age of approximately four and one-half years.
Hydraulic fracturing process. The fracturing process consists of pumping a fracturing fluid into a well at sufficient pressure to fracture the formation. The fracturing fluid is mainly water, which is mixed with specialty additives. Materials known as proppants, primarily sand or sand coated with resin, are suspended in the fracturing fluid and are pumped into the fracture to prop it open. The fracturing fluid is designed to “break,” or lose viscosity, and be forced out of the formation by its pressure, leaving the proppants suspended in the fractures. 
Companies offering fracturing services typically own and operate fleets of mobile, high-pressure pumping systems and other heavy equipment. We refer to these pumping systems, each of which consists of a high-pressure reciprocating pump, diesel engine, transmission and various hoses, valves, tanks and other supporting equipment, all typically mounted to a flat-bed trailer, as “fracturing units.” The group of fracturing units, other equipment and vehicles necessary to perform a typical fracturing job is referred to as a “fleet.” Each fleet typically consists of eight to 20 fracturing units; two or more blenders (one used as a backup), which blend the proppant and chemicals into the fracturing fluid; sand bins, which are large containers used to store sand on location; various vehicles used to transport sand, chemicals, gels and other materials; and various service trucks and a monitoring van equipped with monitoring equipment and computers that control the fracturing process. The personnel assigned to each fleet are commonly referred to as a “crew.” 
An important element of fracturing services is determining the proper fracturing fluid, proppants and injection program to maximize recovery from a given well. We employ field engineering personnel to provide technical evaluation and job design recommendations for customers as an integral element of our fracturing service. Technological developments in the industry over the past several years have focused on proppant density control, liquid gel concentrate capabilities, computer design and monitoring of jobs and cleanup properties for fracturing fluids. 
We purchase the fracturing fluid additives used in our hydraulic fracturing activities from third-party suppliers. The suppliers are responsible for storage, handling and compatibility of the chemicals used in the fracturing fluid. In addition to performing internal vendor environmental and operational quality control at the well site, we also require our suppliers to adhere to strict environmental and quality standards and to maintain minimum inventory levels at regional hubs, thus ensuring adequate supply for our hydraulic fracturing operations. 
Hydraulic fracturing customers and contracts. We contract with our customers pursuant to master services agreements that specify payment terms, audit rights and insurance requirements and allocate certain operational risks through indemnity and similar provisions. We supplement these agreements for each engagement with a bid proposal, subject to customer acceptance, containing terms such as the estimated number of fracturing stages to be performed, pricing, quantities of products required, and horsepower and pressure ratings of the hydraulic fracturing fleets to be used. We are generally compensated based on the number of fracturing stages we complete, and we recognize revenue upon the completion of each fracturing stage. We typically complete one or more fracturing stages per day during the course of a job. A stage is considered complete when the customer requests that pumping discontinue for that stage. Invoices typically include service charges that are determined by hydraulic horsepower requirements and achieved rate of barrels per minute along with product charges for sand, chemicals and other products actually consumed during the course of providing our services. 
Oilfield Rentals 
Our oilfield rentals segment is operated through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Great Plains Oilfield Rental, L.L.C., and provides premium rental tools and specialized services for land-based drilling, completion and workover activities. We offer an extensive line of rental tools, including a full line of tubular products specifically designed for horizontal drilling and completion, with high-torque, premium-connection drill pipe, drill collars and tubing. Additionally, we offer surface rental equipment including blowout preventers, frac tanks, mud tanks and environmental containment that encompass all phases of the hydrocarbon extraction and production process. Our air drilling equipment and services enable extraction in select basins where certain segments of formations preclude the use of drilling fluid, permitting operators to drill through problematic zones without the risk of fluid absorption and damage to the wellbore. We also provide frac-support services, including rental and rig-
3

up/rig-down of wellhead pressure control equipment (“frac stacks”), delivery of on-site frac water through a water transfer operation using innovative lay-flat pipe, and monitoring and controlling of production returns. As of December 31, 2016, we offered oilfield rental services in the Mid-Continent region, Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Marcellus, Niobrara and Utica Shales. We price our rentals and services based on the type of equipment being rented and the services being performed. Substantially all rental revenue we earn is based upon a charge for the actual period of time the rental is provided to our customer on a market-based, fixed per-day or per-hour fee.
Former Oilfield Trucking 
Our former oilfield trucking segment provided drilling rig relocation and logistics services as well as fluid handling services. During the second quarter of 2015, we sold Hodges Trucking Company, L.L.C., which provided drilling rig relocation and logistics services (please read Note 8 “Sale of Hodges Trucking Company, L.L.C.” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein), and we also sold our water hauling assets. As part of the spin-off, we sold our crude hauling assets to a third party. 
Customers and Competition 
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we are dependent on CHK for the majority of our revenues. Our customers pay us market-based rates for the services we provide. To the extent that competitive conditions increase and prices for the services and products we provide decrease, the prices we are able to charge our customers for such products and services may decrease.
We are a party to a master services agreement (the “Master Services Agreement”) with CHK, pursuant to which we provide drilling and other services and supply materials and equipment to CHK. The Master Services Agreement contains general terms and provisions, specifies payment terms, audit rights and insurance requirements and allocates certain operational risks through indemnity and similar provisions. The agreement will remain in effect until we or CHK provide 30 days written notice of termination. The specific terms of each drilling services request are typically provided pursuant to drilling contracts on a well-by-well basis or for a term of a certain number of days or wells. The specific terms of each request for other services are typically set forth in a field ticket or purchase or work order. We believe that our drilling contracts, field tickets or purchase or work orders with CHK are substantially similar to those in prevailing industry contracts, specifically as they relate to pricing, liabilities and payment terms.
In connection with the spin-off, we supplemented the Master Service Agreement with certain new services agreements, including new drilling contracts and a services agreement for hydraulic fracturing services, among others. Please read “—The Spin-Off—Agreements Between Us and CHK” for further discussion of the new services agreements.
Competitors in each of our operating segments include: 

• | Drilling - Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., Trinidad Drilling Ltd., Nabors Industries Ltd., Pioneer Energy Services Corp., and Precision Drilling Corporation.


• | Hydraulic Fracturing - Halliburton Company, Schlumberger Limited, Baker Hughes Incorporated, Superior Energy Services, Inc., Weatherford International plc, RPC, Inc., Keane Group, FTS International, Inc., and C&J Energy Services, Inc.


• | Oilfield Rentals - Key Energy Services, Inc., RPC, Inc., Oil States International, Inc., Baker Oil Tools, Weatherford International plc, Basic Energy Services, Inc., Superior Energy Services, Inc., Quail Tools (owned by Parker Drilling Company), and Knight Oil Tools.

We also compete in each of our operating segments against a significant number of other companies with national, regional, or local operations.
Suppliers 
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts and components that are made by other manufacturers and suppliers for our use. We are not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies or materials. 
4

For our drilling rigs, we generally purchase individual components from reputable original equipment manufacturers and then assemble and commission the rigs ourselves at an internal facility, which we believe results in cost savings and higher quality.
We have purchased the majority of our hydraulic fracturing units from United Engines and FTS International. We purchase the raw materials we use in our hydraulic fracturing operations, such as sand, chemicals and diesel fuel, from a variety of suppliers throughout the U.S. 
To date, we have generally been able to obtain on a timely basis the equipment, parts and supplies necessary to support our operations. Where we currently source materials from one supplier, we believe that we will be able to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of interruption of supply. However, given the limited number of suppliers of certain of our raw materials, we may not always be able to make alternative arrangements should one of our suppliers fail to deliver or timely deliver our materials. 
Employees
At every level of our operations, our employees are critical to our success and committed to operational excellence. Our senior management team has extensive experience building, acquiring and managing oilfield services and other assets. Their focus is on optimizing our business and expanding operations. On an operations level, our supervisory and field personnel are empowered with the training, tools and confidence required to succeed in their jobs. As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 1,700 people, none of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our relationships with our employees to be good. 
Risk Management and Insurance 
The oilfield services business involves a variety of operating risks, including the risk of fire, explosions, blow-outs, pipe failure, abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures or discharges of toxic gases. If any of these should occur, we could incur legal defense costs and suffer substantial losses due to injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations.
We are covered under insurance policies that we believe are customary in the industry with customary deductibles or self-insured retentions. However, there are no assurances that this insurance will be adequate to cover all losses or exposure to liability. We carry $100.0 million in excess liability umbrella policies over our general liability, automobile liability, non-owned aviation liability and employer’s liability policies, as well as a $10.0 million contractor’s pollution liability policy. We provide workers’ compensation insurance coverage to employees in all states in which we operate. While we believe these policies are customary in the industry, they do not provide complete coverage against all operating risks. In addition, our insurance does not cover penalties or fines that may be assessed by a governmental authority. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The insurance coverage that we maintain may not be sufficient to cover every claim made against us and may not be available for purchase in the future on terms we consider commercially reasonable, or at all. Also, in the past, insurance rates have been subject to wide fluctuation, and changes in coverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost or higher deductibles and self-insured retentions. 
Our master services agreements include certain indemnification provisions for losses resulting from operations. Generally, we take responsibility for our own people and property while our customers take responsibility for their own people, property and liabilities related to the well and subsurface operations, regardless of either party’s negligence or fault. For example, our Master Services Agreement with CHK provides that CHK assumes liability for (a) damage to the hole, including the cost to re-drill; (b) damages or claims arising from loss of control of a well or a blowout; (c) damage to the reservoir, geological formation or underground strata; (d) damages arising from the use of radioactive tools or any contamination resulting therefrom; (e) damages arising from pollution or contamination (other than surface spills attributable to our negligence); (f) liability arising from damage to, or escape of any substance from, any pipeline, vessel or storage or production facility; and (g) allegations of subsurface trespass.
In general, any material limitations on contractual indemnity obligations arise only by applicable state law or public policy. Many states place limitations on contractual indemnity agreements, particularly agreements that indemnify a party against the consequences of its own negligence. Furthermore, certain states, including Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico and Wyoming, have enacted statutes generally referred to as “oilfield anti-indemnity acts” expressly prohibiting certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to oilfield services agreements. Such oilfield anti-indemnity acts may restrict or void a 
5

party’s indemnification of us. Please read “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Industry and Our Business” in Item 1A of this report.
Safety and Maintenance 
Our business involves the operation of heavy and powerful equipment which can result in serious injuries to our employees and third parties and substantial damage to property and the environment. We have comprehensive health, safety and environmental (“HSE”) and training programs designed to reduce accidents in the workplace and improve the efficiency of our operations. In addition, our largest customers place great emphasis on HSE and the quality management programs of their contractors. We believe that these factors will gain further importance in the future. We have directed substantial resources toward employee HSE and quality management training programs as well as our employee review process and have benefited from steadily decreasing incident frequencies. 
Regulation of Operations 
We operate under the jurisdiction of a number of federal, state and local regulatory bodies that regulate worker safety, the handling of hazardous materials, the transportation of explosives, the protection of the environment and safe driving procedures. Regulations concerning equipment certification create an ongoing need for regular maintenance that is incorporated into our daily operating procedures. Please read “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Industry and Our Business” in Item 1A of this report. 
Among the services we provide and assets we utilize, we operate as a motor carrier and therefore are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation and by various state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations and regulatory safety, financial reporting and certain mergers, consolidations and acquisitions. 
Interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the U.S. Department of Transportation. To a large degree, intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to safety regulations that mirror federal regulations. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations, while the Department of Transportation mandates drug testing of drivers. 
From time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, such as proposals to increase federal, state, or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted. 
Environmental Matters 
Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to the release, emission or discharge of materials into the environment, the generation, storage, transportation, handling and disposal of materials (including solid and hazardous wastes) or the safety of employees, or otherwise relating to preservation or protection of human health and safety, pollution prevention or remediation, natural resources, wildlife or the environment. Federal environmental, health and safety requirements that govern our operations include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), the Clean Air Act (the “CAA”), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and the regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws. 
Some of these laws, including CERCLA and analogous state laws, may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered responsible for releases of a hazardous substance or other pollutant into the environment. These persons may include the current or former owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and persons that generated, disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at the site. 
Other federal and state laws, in particular RCRA, regulate hazardous wastes and non-hazardous solid wastes. In the course of our operations, we generate petroleum hydrocarbon wastes and other maintenance wastes. Some of our wastes are not currently classified as hazardous wastes, but may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes and may thus become subject to more rigorous and costly compliance and disposal requirements. 
6

We own or lease a number of properties that have been used as service yards in support of oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that we considered to be standard in the industry at the time, repair and maintenance activities on rigs and equipment stored in these service yards may have resulted in the disposal or release of hydrocarbons, wastes, or hazardous substances, including Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (“NORM”) at or from these yards or at or from other locations where these wastes have been taken for treatment, storage or disposal. In addition, we own or lease properties that in the past were used by third parties whose operations were not under our control. These properties and any hydrocarbons or other materials handled thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA or analogous state laws. Under these types of laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously released hazardous substances, wastes or property contamination, or to pay for such cleanup activity. 
Further, our operations are subject to the federal CAA and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including our non-road mobile engines, and impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Compliance with increasingly stringent air emissions regulations may result in increased costs as we continue to grow. Beyond that, federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal CAA and associated state laws and regulations. 
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as “the Clean Water Act”) and resulting regulations, which are primarily implemented through a system of permits, govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the United States. Violation of the Clean Water Act requirements may result in a fine as well as an order to stop facility construction or operation or to stop hauling wastewaters to third party facilities. In addition, the Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the United States. 
The SDWA and comparable local and state provisions restrict the disposal, treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development. Subsurface emplacement of fluids (including disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery) is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that, in some cases, includes the state oil and gas regulatory authority or the state’s environmental authority. These regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities. 
We seek to manage environmental liability risks through provisions in our contracts with our customers that allocate risks relating to surface activities associated with the fracturing process to us and risks relating to “down-hole” liabilities to our customers. Our contracts generally require our customers to indemnify us against pollution and environmental damages originating below the surface of the ground or arising out of water disposal, or otherwise caused by the customer, other contractors or other third parties. In turn, our contracts generally require us to indemnify our customers for pollution and environmental damages originating at or above the surface caused solely by us. We seek to maintain consistent risk-allocation and indemnification provisions in our customer agreements to the greatest extent possible. Some of our contracts, however, may contain less explicit indemnification provisions, which would typically provide that each party will indemnify the other against liabilities to third parties resulting from the indemnifying party’s actions, except to the extent such liability results from the indemnified party’s gross negligence, willful misconduct or intentional act. 
We have made and will continue to make expenditures to comply with health, safety and environmental regulations and requirements. These are necessary business costs in the oilfield services industry. Although we are not fully insured against all environmental, health and safety risks, and our insurance does not cover any penalties or fines that may be issued by a governmental authority, we maintain insurance coverage which we believe is customary in the industry. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, such as stricter and more comprehensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, as well as claims for damages to property or persons, resulting from company operations, could result in substantial costs and liabilities, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, to us. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations. We believe that the cost of maintaining compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations, but new or more stringent regulations could increase the cost of doing business and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, causing us to incur significant costs and liabilities, including for third-party claims for damage to property and natural resources or personal injury. Please read “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Industry and Our Business” in Item 1A of this report. 
Hydraulic Fracturing. Vast quantities of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas deposits exist in deep shale unconventional formations. It is customary in our industry to recover these resources from these deep formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing, combined with horizontal drilling. 
7

Hydraulic fracturing techniques have been used by the industry since 1947, and currently, more than 90% of all oil and natural gas wells drilled in the U.S. employ hydraulic fracturing. We strive to conduct our fracturing operations in accordance with best practices, industry standards, and all regulatory requirements. For example, we monitor rate and pressure to ensure that the services are performed as planned. We also perform fracturing for wells that have been constructed with multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed to protect freshwater aquifers.
Legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal, state and local levels have been initiated that may impose additional requirements on our oilfield services, including hydraulic fracturing. In a few instances these have included bans on hydraulic fracturing. To date, these initiatives have not materially affected our operations, but they could spur further action towards federal, state, or local legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business of such additional federal, state, or local legislation or regulations affecting hydraulic fracturing. In addition, there is a growing trend among states to require us to provide information about the chemicals and products we maintain on location and use during hydraulic fracturing activities. Many of these laws and regulations require that we disclose information about these chemicals and products. In certain cases, these chemicals and products are manufactured and/or imported by third parties and we therefore must rely upon such third parties for such information. The consequences of any inaccurate disclosure, failure to disclose, or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operational results. See “Risk Factors - Changes in laws or government regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our costs of doing business, limit the areas in which our customers can operate and reduce oil and natural gas production by our customers, which could adversely impact our business” in Item 1A of this report.
Greenhouse Gas Regulations. In June 2013, President Obama unveiled a Presidential climate action plan designed to reduce emissions in the U.S. of methane, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (“GHG”). In furtherance of that plan, the Obama Administration launched a number of initiatives, including the development of standards restricting GHG emissions from light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles and of a Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions from the oil and gas industry. The former Administration’s goal was to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by 40-45% by 2025 as compared to 2012 levels. Accordingly, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) adopted and implemented a comprehensive suite of regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”). For instance, in May 2016, the EPA issued final new source performance standards governing methane emissions, imposing more stringent controls on methane and volatile organic compounds emissions at new and modified oil and natural gas production, processing, storage, and transmission facilities. The EPA has also announced that it intends to impose methane emission standards for existing sources and has issued information collection requests to companies with production, gathering and boosting, gas processing, storage, and transmission facilities. Similarly, the Bureau of Land Management issued final rules in November 2016 relating to the venting, flaring and leaking of natural gas by oil and natural gas producers who operate on federal and Indian lands. Furthermore, various state and local governments are considering enacting new legislation and promulgating new regulations governing or restricting GHG emissions from stationary sources such as our equipment and operations or promoting the use of renewable energy. Finally, in April 2016, the United States signed the Paris Agreement, which requires member countries to review and “represent a progression” in their nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years. See “Risk Factors - Our operations may incur substantial liabilities to comply with climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives.” in Item 1A of this report.
Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11 Proceedings and Related Events
On May 12, 2016, the Company and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a Second Amended and Restated Restructuring Support Agreement (the “Restructuring Support Agreement”) with (i) certain noteholders of the 6.625% senior unsecured notes due 2019 of SSO and SSF (the “2019 Notes”), (ii) certain lenders under the Company’s Incremental Term Supplement (Tranche A) loan (the “Incremental Term Loan”), (iii) certain lenders under the Company’s $400.0 million Term Loan Credit Agreement dated June 25, 2014 (the “Term Loan”), and (iv) certain noteholders of the 6.50% senior unsecured notes due 2022 of the Company (the “2022 Notes”). 

On June 7, 2016, the Debtors filed the Bankruptcy Petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. The filings of the Bankruptcy Petitions constituted an event of default with respect to the 2019 Notes, the 2022 Notes, the Term Loan and the Incremental Term Loan (collectively, the “Outstanding Debt”) and constituted an event of default under our $275.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Pre-Petition Credit Facility”). See Note 11 “Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein. Pursuant to Chapter 11, the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions automatically stayed most actions against the Debtors, including actions to collect indebtedness incurred prior to the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions or to exercise control over the Debtor’s property. Accordingly, although the Bankruptcy Petitions triggered defaults under the Outstanding Debt, creditors were generally stayed from taking action as a result of these defaults. These defaults were 
8

deemed waived or cured upon the Effective Date of the Plan. The Debtors also filed the Plan and a related solicitation and disclosure statement on June 7, 2016.
On July 14, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Confirmation Order. The Debtors satisfied the remaining conditions to effectiveness contemplated under the Plan and emerged from Chapter 11 on August 1, 2016.
The Plan contemplated that we continue our day-to-day operations substantially as previously conducted and that all of our commercial and operational contracts remained in effect in accordance with their terms preserving the rights of all parties. The significant elements of the Plan included:

• | payment in full of all trade creditors and other general unsecured creditors in the ordinary course of business;


• | the exchange of the full $650.0 million of the 2019 Notes into 96.75% of new common stock issued in the reorganization (the “New Common Stock”);


• | the exchange of the full $450.0 million of the 2022 Notes for 3.25% of the New Common Stock as well as

warrants exercisable for 15% of the New Common Stock at predetermined equity values;

• | the issuance to our existing common stockholders of two series of warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 20% of the New Common Stock at predetermined equity values;


• | the maintenance of our $400.0 million existing secured Term Loan while the lenders holding Term Loans (i) received (a) payment of an amount equal to 2% of the Term Loans; and (b) as further security for the Term Loans, second-priority liens and security interests in the collateral securing the company’s New ABL Credit Facility (as defined herein), which collateral, together with the existing collateral securing the Term Loans and Tranche A Incremental Term Loans, is governed by an inter-creditor agreement among the applicable secured parties; and (ii) continued to hold Term Loans under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, as amended to reflect, among other modifications, the reduction of the maturity date of the Term Loans by one year and an affirmative covenant by the Company to use commercially reasonably efforts to maintain credit ratings for the Term Loans; and


• | the payment of a consent fee equal to 2% of the Incremental Term Loan plus $15.0 million of the outstanding Incremental Term Loan balance, together with the maintenance of the remaining $84.0 million balance of the Incremental Term Loan on identical terms, except for the suspension of any prepayment premium for a period of 18 months.

The Plan effectuated, among other things, a substantial reduction in our debt, including $1.1 billion in the aggregate of the face amount of the 2019 Notes and 2022 Notes.
In accordance with the Plan, on the Effective Date, we issued an aggregate of 22,000,000 shares of New Common Stock to the holders of the 2019 and 2022 Notes. 
In accordance with the Plan, on the Effective Date, we entered into a warrant agreement with Computershare Inc. and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as the warrant agent, (the “Warrant Agreement”) and issued three series of warrants to holders of 2022 Notes and to our existing common stockholders as follows:

• | We issued Series A Warrants (“Series A Warrants”), which are exercisable until August 1, 2021, to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,882,353 shares of New Common Stock, at an exercise price of $23.82 per share, to holders of the 2022 Notes.


• | We issued Series B Warrants (“Series B Warrants”), which are exercisable until August 1, 2021, to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,875,817 shares of New Common Stock, at an exercise price of $69.08 per share, to our existing common stockholders.


• | We issued Series C Warrants (“Series C Warrants,” and, together with the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants, the “Warrants”), which are exercisable until August 1, 2023, to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,195,352 shares of New Common Stock at an exercise price of $86.93 per share, to our existing common stockholders.

All unexercised Warrants will expire and the rights of the holders of such warrants (the “Warrant Holders”) to purchase shares of New Common Stock will terminate on the first to occur of (i) the close of business on their respective expiration dates or (ii) the date of completion of (A) any Affiliated Asset Sale (as defined in the Warrant Agreement), or (B) a Change of Control (as defined in the Warrant Agreement). Following the Effective Date, there were 3,882,353 Series A Warrants, 2,875,817 Series B Warrants and 3,195,352 Series C Warrants outstanding.
In the event of a merger or consolidation where (i) the acquirer is not an affiliate of the Company and (ii) all of the equity held by equity holders of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto is extinguished or replaced by equity in a different entity (except in cases where the equity holders of the Company represent more than 50% of the total equity of such 
9

surviving entity) (a “Non-Affiliate Combination”), holders of Warrants shall be solely entitled to receive the consideration per Warrant that is payable per share of common stock of the Company, less the applicable exercise price of the Warrant, paid in the same form and in the same proportion as is payable to holders of common stock. If the consideration is any form other than cash, the holders of the Warrants shall have ten business days prior to the consummation of the Non-Affiliate Combination to exercise their respective Warrants, and any Warrants not exercised will terminate.
In accordance with the Plan, on September 20, 2016, the Company adopted the Seventy Seven Energy Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan”). For additional information, see Note 14 “Share-Based Compensation” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.
Successor Issuer
Pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), the Series B Warrants and Series C Warrants were deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and the Company was deemed to be the successor registrant to the Company in its state before the Effective Date. Such registration expired on September 6, 2016, and we filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A to effect the registration of the Series B Warrants and Series C Warrants under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. As a result, the Company remained subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act following the Effective Date.
Trading of New Common Stock
The New Common Stock is not traded on a national securities exchange. However, since August 17, 2016, SSE’s common stock has traded on the OTC Market Group Inc.’s Grey market (the “OTC Grey”) under the symbol “SVNT.” See Item 5 of this report. The Company can provide no assurance that the New Common Stock will trade on a nationally recognized market or an over-the-counter market, whether broker-dealers will provide public quotes of the reorganized Company’s common stock on an over-the-counter market, whether the trading volume on an over-the-counter market of the Company’s common stock will be sufficient to provide for an efficient trading market, or whether quotes for the Company’s common stock may be blocked by the OTC Markets Group in the future. 
Registration Rights Agreement
On the Effective Date, by operation of the Plan, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with certain funds affiliated with and/or managed by each of BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC, Axar Capital Management, LLC and Mudrick Capital Management, L.P. (each a “Registration Rights Holder,” and collectively, the “Registration Rights Holders”).
The Registration Rights Agreement provides certain demand registration rights to the Registration Rights Holders at any time following the six-month anniversary of the Effective Date. The Company will not be required to effect more than (i) four demand registrations delivered by each Registration Rights Holder, or (ii) one demand registration delivered by any holder in any 180-day period.
If, following the six-month anniversary of the Effective date, the Company qualifies for the use of Form S-3, the Registration Rights Holders may require the Company, subject to restrictions set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement, to file a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 covering the resale of such holder’s registrable securities.
In addition, if the Company proposes to register shares of its New Common Stock in certain circumstances, the Registration Rights Holders will have certain “piggyback” registration rights, subject to restrictions set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement, to include their shares of New Common Stock in the registration statement.
Senior Secured Debtor-In-Possession Credit Agreement; New ABL Credit Facility
On June 8, 2016, in connection with the filings of the Bankruptcy Petitions, the Company, with certain of our subsidiaries as borrowers, entered into a senior secured debtor-in-possession credit facility (the “DIP Facility”) with total commitments of $100.0 million. For additional discussion related to the DIP Facility, see Note 11 “Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.
On the Effective Date, by operation of the Plan, the DIP Facility was amended and restated, and the outstanding obligations pursuant thereto were converted to obligations under a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million (the “New ABL Credit Facility”).
10

New Directors
On the Effective Date, in accordance with the Plan and pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement that we entered into with certain stockholders on the Effective Date, Jerry Winchester and Edward J. DiPaolo, who were existing directors of the Company, and Andrew Axelrod, Victor Danh, Steven Hinchman, David King and Doug Wall became members of the Board until the first annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders to be held in 2017, and their respective successors are duly elected and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. 
Conversion to Delaware Corporation
Effective July 22, 2016, in accordance with the Plan and with the laws of the State of Delaware and the State of Oklahoma, we converted our form of organization from an Oklahoma corporation (the “Oklahoma Predecessor Corporation”) to a Delaware limited liability company and, immediately thereafter, to a Delaware corporation (the “Delaware Successor Corporation”). As a result of the conversions, the equity holders of the Oklahoma Predecessor Corporation became the equity holders of the Delaware Successor Corporation. The name of the Company remained “Seventy Seven Energy Inc.”
For purposes of Delaware law, the Delaware Successor Corporation is deemed to be the same entity as the Company before the conversions, and its existence is deemed to have commenced on the date of original incorporation of the Company. Furthermore, under Delaware law, the rights, assets, operations, liabilities and obligations that comprised the going business of the Company before the conversions remain the rights, assets, operations, liabilities and obligations of the Company after the conversions.
The Spin-Off
The transactions in which SSE became an independent, publicly traded company, including the cash distribution to CHK referenced below, are referred to collectively as the “spin-off”. Prior to the spin-off, we conducted our business as COO. As part of the spin-off, we completed the following transactions, among others:

• | the entrance into our Pre-Petition Credit Facility and Term Loan. We used the proceeds from borrowings under these new facilities to repay in full and terminate our existing $500.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Old Credit Facility”);


• | the issuance of our 2022 Notes. We used the net proceeds of approximately $493.8 million to make a cash distribution of approximately $391.0 million to CHK, to repay a portion of outstanding indebtedness under the Pre-Petition Credit Facility, and for general corporate purposes.


• | we distributed our compression unit manufacturing and geosteering businesses to CHK. Please read “Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this report for further discussion of the financial impact of these businesses to our historical financial results.


• | we sold our crude hauling assets to a third party and used a portion of the net proceeds received to make a $30.9 million cash distribution to CHK.


• | CHK transferred to us buildings and real estate used in our business, including property and equipment, at cost of approximately $212.5 million and accumulated depreciation of $22.2 million as of the spin-off date. Prior to the spin-off, we leased these buildings and real estate from CHK pursuant to a facilities lease agreement and incurred lease expense of $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In connection with the spin-off, the facilities lease agreement was terminated.


• | COO transferred all of its existing assets, operations and liabilities, including our 2019 Notes, to SSO. SSO is an Oklahoma limited liability company, our direct wholly-owned subsidiary and the direct owner of all our operating subsidiaries.


• | COO was renamed SSE and converted from a limited liability company to a corporation.

Agreements Between Us and CHK
In connection with the spin-off, we supplemented the Master Services Agreement with the new agreements described below.
New Services Agreements
Under the new services agreement governing our provision of hydraulic fracturing services for CHK (the “New Services Agreement”), CHK is required to utilize the lesser of (i) seven, five and three of our hydraulic fracturing crews in years one, two and three of the agreement, respectively, or (ii) fifty percent (50%) of the total number of all hydraulic fracturing crews working for CHK in all its operating regions during the respective year. CHK is also required to utilize our hydraulic fracturing services for a minimum number of stages as set forth in the agreement. CHK is entitled to terminate the agreement in certain situations, including in the event we fail to materially comply with the overall quality of service provided by similar service providers. Additionally, CHK’s requirement to utilize our services may be suspended under certain circumstances, such as when we are unable to timely accept and supply services ordered by CHK or as a result of a force majeure event. Our hydraulic fracturing backlog under the New Services Agreement as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $44.9 million.
In connection with the spin-off, we entered into rig-specific daywork drilling contracts with CHK for the provision of drilling services having terms similar to those we currently use for other customers (the “Drilling Contracts”). The Drilling Contracts had a commencement date of July 1, 2014 and terms ranging from three months to three years. CHK has the right to terminate a drilling contract in certain circumstances. Our drilling backlog under the Drilling Contracts as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $142.5 million and our early contract termination value related to the Drilling Contracts was $79.9 million. For additional information about our contractual backlog please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Backlog” in Item 7 of this report. 
Master Separation Agreement
The master separation agreement entered into between us and CHK governs the separation of our businesses from CHK, the distribution of our shares to CHK shareholders and other matters related to CHK’s relationship with us, including cross-indemnities between us and CHK. In general, CHK agreed to indemnify us for any liabilities relating the CHK’s business and we agreed to indemnify CHK for any liabilities relating to our business.
Tax Sharing Agreement
In connection with the spin-off, we and CHK entered into a tax sharing agreement that governs our respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, the preparation and filing of tax returns, the control of audits and other tax proceedings and certain other matters regarding taxes. References in this summary description of the tax sharing agreement to the terms “tax” or “taxes” mean taxes as well as any interest, penalties, additions to tax or additional amounts in respect of such taxes.
Under the tax sharing agreement, we generally are liable for and will indemnify CHK against all taxes attributable to our business and will be allocated all tax benefits attributable to such business. CHK generally is liable for and will indemnify us against all taxes attributable to its other businesses and will be allocated all tax benefits attributable to such businesses.
Finally, the tax sharing agreement will require that neither we nor any of our affiliates take or fail to take any action after the effective date of the tax sharing agreement that (i) would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with or cause to be untrue any material statement, covenant or representation in any representation letters, tax opinions or Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) private letter ruling obtained by CHK or (ii) would be inconsistent with the spin-off generally qualifying as a tax-free transaction described under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code.
Moreover, CHK generally will be liable for and indemnify us for any taxes arising from the spin-off or certain related transactions that are imposed on us, CHK or its other subsidiaries. However, we would be liable for and indemnify CHK for any such taxes to the extent they result from certain actions or failures to act by us that occur after the effective date of the tax sharing agreement.
Employee Matters Agreement
In connection with the spin-off, we and CHK entered into an employee matters agreement, which provides that each of CHK and SSE has responsibility for its own employees and compensation plans. The agreement also contains provisions 
12

concerning benefit protection for both SSE and CHK employees, treatment of holders of CHK stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units, and cooperation between us and CHK in the sharing of employee information and maintenance of confidentiality.
Transition Services Agreement
Prior to the spin-off, we had an administrative services agreement (the “Administrative Services Agreement”) with CHK pursuant to which CHK allocated certain expenses to us. Under the Administrative Services Agreement, in return for the general and administrative services provided by CHK, we reimbursed CHK on a monthly basis for the overhead expenses incurred by CHK on our behalf in accordance with its allocation policy, which included actual out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the provision of any of the services under the agreement, including the wages and benefits of CHK employees who performed services on our behalf. In connection with the spin-off, we terminated the Administrative Services Agreement and entered into a transition services agreement (the “Transition Services Agreement”). These charges from CHK were $8.3 million and $18.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and we terminated the Transition Services Agreement during the second quarter of 2015.
