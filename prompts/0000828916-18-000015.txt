ITEM 1. Business
General Development of Business.    Weingarten Realty Investors is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) organized under the Texas Business Organizations Code. We, and our predecessor entity, began the ownership of shopping centers and other commercial real estate in 1948. Our primary business is leasing space to tenants in the shopping centers we own or lease. We also provide property management services for which we charge fees to either joint ventures where we are partners or other outside owners.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Item 7 and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, for information on certain recent developments of the Company. 
Financial Information about Segments.    We are in the business of owning, managing and developing retail shopping centers. As each of our centers has similar characteristics and amenities, our operations have been aggregated into one reportable segment. See the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding reportable segments.
Narrative Description of Business.    At December 31, 2017, we owned or operated under long-term leases, either directly or through our interest in real estate joint ventures or partnerships, a total of 204 properties, which are located in 17 states spanning the country from coast to coast. The portfolio of properties contains approximately 41.3 million square feet of gross leasable area that is either owned by us or others. 
We also owned interests in 25 parcels of land held for development that totaled approximately 18.0 million square feet.
At December 31, 2017, we employed 281 full-time persons; our principal executive offices are located at 2600 Citadel Plaza Drive, Houston, Texas 77008; and our phone number is (713) 866-6000. We also have 10 regional offices located in various parts of the United States (“U.S.”).
Investment and Operating Strategy.    Our goal is to remain a leader in owning and operating top-tier neighborhood and community shopping centers in certain markets of the U.S. We expect to achieve this goal by:

• | raising net asset value and cash flows through quality acquisitions, redevelopments and new developments;


• | strategic focus on core operating fundamentals through our decentralized operating platform built on local expertise in leasing and property management;

1


• | disciplined growth from strategic acquisitions and new developments;


• | disposition of assets that no longer meet our ownership criteria, in which proceeds may be recycled by repaying debt, purchasing new assets or reinvesting in currently owned assets or for other corporate purposes; and


• | commitment to maintaining a conservatively leveraged balance sheet, strong liquidity, a well-staggered debt maturity schedule and strong credit agency ratings.

We may either purchase, develop or lease income-producing properties in the future, and may also participate with other entities in property ownership through partnerships, joint ventures or similar types of co-ownership. 
We may invest in mortgages; however, we have traditionally invested in first mortgages to real estate joint ventures or partnerships in which we own an equity interest or to obtain control over a real estate asset that we desire to own. We may also invest in securities of other issuers for the purpose, among others, of exercising control over such entities, subject to the gross income and asset tests necessary for REIT qualification.
In acquiring and developing properties, we attempt to accumulate enough properties in a geographic area to allow for the establishment of a regional office, which enables us to obtain in-depth knowledge of the market from a leasing perspective and to have easy access to the property and our tenants from a management viewpoint.
We expect to continue our focus on the future growth of the portfolio in neighborhood and community shopping centers in markets where we currently operate throughout the U.S. Our markets of interest reflect high income and job growth, as well as high barriers-to-entry. Our attention is also focused on high quality, supermarket-anchored and necessity-based centers, which may include mixed-use properties containing this type of retail component.
Diversification from both a geographic and tenancy perspective is a critical component of our operating strategy. Our largest markets are located in California, Florida and Texas, which represent 11.2%, 18.0% and 28.4%, respectively, of our total properties' gross leasable area. With respect to tenant diversification, our two largest tenants, The Kroger Co. and TJX Companies, Inc., accounted for 2.8% and 2.3%, respectively, of our total base minimum rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. No other tenant accounted for more than 1.9% of our total base minimum rental revenues. Our anchor tenants are supermarkets, value-oriented apparel/discount stores and other retailers or service providers who generally sell basic necessity-type goods and services. We believe the stability of our anchor tenants, combined with convenient locations, attractive and well-maintained properties, high quality retailers and a strong tenant mix, should ensure the long-term success of our merchants and the viability of our portfolio.
Strategically, we strive to finance our growth and working capital needs in a conservative manner, including managing our debt maturities. Our senior debt credit ratings were BBB with a projected stable outlook from Standard & Poors and Baa1 with a projected stable outlook from Moody’s Investor Services as of December 31, 2017. We intend to maintain a conservative approach to managing our balance sheet, which, in turn, should give us many options for raising debt or equity capital when needed. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, our ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred dividends as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), not based on funds from operations attributable to common shareholders, was 4.74 to 1 and 4.05 to 1, respectively. Our debt to total assets before depreciation ratio was 38.6% and 42.0% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
We have a $200 million share repurchase plan under which we may repurchase common shares of beneficial interest ("common shares") from time-to-time in open-market or privately negotiated purchases based on management's evaluation of market conditions and other factors. 
Our policies with respect to the investment and operating strategies discussed above are periodically reviewed by our Board of Trust Managers and may be modified without a vote of our shareholders.
Location of Properties.    Our properties are located in 17 states, principally in the South, West Coast and Southeast Coast of the U.S. As of December 31, 2017, we have 204 properties that were owned or operated under long-term leases, either directly or through our interest in real estate joint ventures or partnerships. Total revenues generated by our centers located in Houston and its surrounding areas was 19.6% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, and an additional 9.2% of total revenue was generated in 2017 from centers that are located in other parts of Texas. An additional 17.5% and 16.7%, respectively, of total revenue was generated in 2017 in Florida and California. As of December 31, 2017, we also had 25 parcels of land held for development, six of which were located in Houston and its surrounding areas and 11 of which were located in other parts of Texas. Because of our investments in Texas, including Houston and its surrounding areas, Florida and California, these economies could affect our business and operations more so than in other geographic areas.

Competition.    We compete with numerous other developers and real estate companies (both public and private), financial institutions and other investors engaged in the development, acquisition and operation of shopping centers in our trade areas. This results in competition for the acquisition of both existing income-producing properties and prime development sites.
We also compete for tenants to occupy the space that is developed, acquired and managed by our competitors. The principal competitive factors in attracting tenants in our market areas are location, price, anchor tenants and maintenance of properties. We believe our key competitive advantages include the favorable locations of our properties, the strong demographics surrounding our centers, knowledge of markets and customer bases, our ability to provide a retailer with multiple locations with quality anchor tenants and the practice of continuous maintenance and renovation of our properties.
Qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust.    As of December 31, 2017, we met the qualification requirements of a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. As a result, we will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we meet certain requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, with the exception of our taxable REIT subsidiary.
