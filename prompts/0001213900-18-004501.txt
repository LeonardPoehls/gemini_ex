ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction
 
Rebel Group, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Florida on September 13, 2011. Effective April 16, 2013, the Company changed its name from “First Social Networx Corp.” to “Moxian Group Holdings, Inc.” with “MOXG” as its trading symbol. Also, effective April 16, 2013, the Company increased the number of shares that it is authorized to issue to a total of 600,000,000 shares, including 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.0001 per share. In addition, effective April 16, 2013, the Company effected a 20-for-1 forward stock split of its Common Stock, without changing the par value or the number of authorized shares of the Common Stock (the “Forward Split”).
 
On April 25, 2013, pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement, the Company completed a reverse acquisition of Moxian BVI and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Moxian HK, Moxian Shenzhen and Moxian Malaysia (the “Share Exchange Transaction”). The Company acquired the operating business of Moxian BVI and its subsidiaries and the Company ceased being a shell company as such term is defined under Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. After the incorporation of the business of Moxian BVI, the Company changed its business to developing a social network platform that sought to integrate social media and business into one single platform.
 
On February 17, 2014, the Company incorporated a new wholly-owned subsidiary, Moxian Intellectual Property Limited, under the laws of Samoa (“Moxian IP”). On February 19, 2014, Moxian HK and Moxian Shenzhen entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement with Moxian IP, where Moxian HK and Moxian Shenzhen assigned and transferred all of the intellectual property rights that they respectively owned in connection with the Moxian business (the “IP Rights”) to Moxian IP in consideration of $1,000,000. As a result, the Company then owned and controlled such IP Rights through Moxian IP.
 
On February 19, 2014, the shareholders then holding a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company approved and authorized the Company to enter into a License and Acquisition Agreement (the “License and Acquisition Agreement”) with MOXC, pursuant to which the Company sold 100% of the equity interests of Moxian BVI together with its subsidiaries to Moxian CN Group Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MOXC (“Moxian CN Samoa”) for $1,000,000. The License and Acquisition Agreement closed on February 21, 2014. As a result, Moxian BVI, together with its subsidiaries, Moxian HK, Moxian Shenzhen, and Moxian Malaysia, became the subsidiaries of MOXC.

Under the License and Acquisition Agreement, the Company also agreed to grant MOXC the exclusive right to use the Company’s then held IP Rights in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, and other countries and regions where the Company conduct business (the “Licensed Territory”) as well as the exclusive right to solicit, promote, distribute and sell Moxian products and services in the Licensed Territory for five years (the “License”). In exchange for such License, MOXC agreed to pay to the Company: (i) $1,000,000 as a license maintenance royalty each year commencing on the first anniversary of the date of the License and Acquisition Agreement and (ii) 3% of the gross profit resulting from distribution and sale of our products and services on behalf of the Company as an earned royalty. In addition, MOXC had the right to acquire the new IP Rights that are developed by the Company and sub-license such rights to a third party. MOXC was also under the obligation to develop the social media market of our products and services in the Licensed Territory. This agreement was subsequently terminated as noted later in the documents.
 
The Company sought to acquire a new business in the technology area and as a result, on July 23, 2014, the Company changed its name from “Moxian Group Holdings, Inc.” to “Inception Technology Group, Inc.” Also, effective July 23, 2014, the Company effected a 1-for-5 reverse split of its issued and outstanding Common Stock. However, no acquisition of a technology business was closed or consummated.
 
On December 5, 2014, the Company amended the Articles of Incorporation to change its corporate name from “Inception Technology Group, Inc.” to “Rebel Group, Inc.” and effectuated a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of its Common Stock, without changing the par value or the number of authorized shares of the Common Stock (the “Reverse Split”).
 
The business plan of the Company was originally to utilize a social network platform that integrated social media and business into one single platform to promote businesses of merchants and assist the targeted clients to find consumers online and bring them into real-world stores. Immediately after the completion of the Share Exchange Transaction and the Equity Transfer Transaction, as such terms are defined below, the Company discontinued its social media business and changed its business to producing dynamic Mixed Martial Arts (“MMA”) fighting events and promoting MMA fighting in China and Singapore.
 
Rebel Holdings Limited (Rebel FC), which utilizes the trade name of Rebel Fighting Championship, was incorporated on October 28, 2014 in the British Virgin Islands and engages in the business of hosting and promoting MMA events.
 
Pure Heart was incorporated under the laws of Singapore on August 24, 2000 under the name “Soo Kee Coffeeshop Pte. Ltd.” Effective November 27, 2002, it changed its name to “Asia Pacific Export International Pte Ltd.” It later changed its name from “Asia Pacific Export International Pte Ltd.” to “Pure Heart Entertainment Pte Ltd.” on June 7, 2013. As of October 30, 2014, it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Rebel FC. Pure Heart is an operating subsidiary of Rebel FC and is dedicated to hosting and promoting MMA events.
 
SCA Capital Limited, a British Virgin Islands company, was incorporated on January 7, 2011 and holds the intellectual property rights relating to the Rebel FC business. On October 28, 2014, SCA Capital became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rebel FC.

Share Exchange Transaction
 
On January 30, 2015, REBL, Rebel FC and the sole stockholder of Rebel FC who owned 100% of Rebel FC (the “Rebel FC Stockholder”) entered into and consummated transactions pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement,” such transaction referred to as the “Share Exchange Transaction”), whereby the Company issued to the Rebel FC Stockholder 20,700,000 shares of its Common Stock, par value $.0001 per share, in exchange for 100% of the equity interests of Rebel FC held by the Rebel FC Stockholder. The shares of our Common Stock received by the Rebel FC Stockholder in the Share Exchange Transaction then constituted approximately 90% of our issued and outstanding Common Stock. As a result of the Share Exchange Transaction, Rebel FC, together with its subsidiaries, Pure Heart and SCA Capital, became REBL’s wholly-owned subsidiaries.
 
The Share Exchange Agreement contained representations and warranties by us, Rebel FC and the Rebel FC Stockholder which are customary for transactions of this type such as, with respect to the Company: organization, good standing and qualification to do business; capitalization; subsidiaries; authorization and validity of the transaction and transaction documents; consents being obtained or not required to consummate the transaction; no conflict or violation of Articles of Incorporation; with respect to Rebel FC: authorization; capitalization; and title to Rebel FC’s ordinary shares being exchanged, and with respect to Rebel FC Stockholder: authorization; no conflict or violation of law; investment purpose; reliance on exemption on the Company’s Common Stock to be exchanged; and transfer or resale pursuant to the Securities Act.
 
Our acquisition of Rebel FC and its subsidiaries pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement was accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization effected by a share exchange. Rebel FC was considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes.
 
Equity Transfer Transaction
 
The Transaction
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of the Share Exchange Transaction, the Company entered into an Equity Transfer Agreement (the “Equity Transfer Agreement,” such transaction, the “Equity Transfer Transaction”) with MOXC, to sell, transfer, and convey 50,000 ordinary shares of Moxian IP, constituting 100% equity interests of Moxian IP for $6,782,000 (the “Moxian IP Transfer Price”). The Moxian IP Transfer Price for Moxian IP is based on an appraisal report, dated November 15, 2014, prepared by Grant Sherman Appraisal Limited, an independent appraiser.

Termination of the License and Acquisition Agreement
 
As set forth above, on February 19, 2014, the Company and MOXC entered into a License and Acquisition Agreement, where the Company granted to MOXC the exclusive right to use the intellectual property rights owned by Moxian IP and in consideration of such license, MOXC agreed to pay (i) $1,000,000 as license maintenance royalty each year commencing on the first anniversary of the date of the License Agreement; and (ii) 3% of the gross profits resulting from the distribution and sale of the products and services on behalf of the Company as an earned royalty. Pursuant to the License and Acquisition Agreement, the Company also agreed to sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver all of the equity interests of Moxian Group Limited, a corporation incorporated under the laws of British Virgin Islands to Moxian CN SAMOA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MOXC, for the consideration of $1,000,000 (such transaction, the “Sale of Moxian BVI,” and the purchase price, the “Moxian BVI Transfer Price”). Immediately prior to the execution of the Equity Transfer Agreement, the Moxian BVI Transfer Price was not paid and no license maintenance royalty or earned royalty under the License and Acquisition Agreement had accrued.
 
Therefore, under the Equity Transfer Agreement, the Company and MOXC agreed to terminate the License and Acquisition Agreement so that the liabilities of MOXC and the rights of the Company thereunder, other than the Moxian BVI Transfer Price, were terminated.
 
Pursuant to the Equity Transfer Agreement, MOXC agreed to repay the Moxian IP Transfer Price and the Moxian BVI Transfer Price in the aggregate of $7,782,000 in the form of a convertible promissory note (the “Note”) issued by MOXC. The maturity date for the Note was October 30, 2015 with 1% interest per annum, and all sums due under this Note could be converted at the conversion price of $1.00 per share (“Conversion Price”) at the option of MOXC, if the volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of MOXC’s common stock for a period of thirty (30) trading days immediately prior to the date of conversion was higher than the Conversion Price. Under the Note, MOXC had a right of first refusal to purchase the shares issuable upon conversion at the price of 80% of the VWAP for 30 trading days immediately prior to the date of the proposed repurchase by MOXC.
 
On August 14, 2015, due to the VWAP of the MOXC Common Stock for 30 trading day prior to August 14, 2015 was higher than $1.00, which triggered the clause of conversion under the MOXC Note, MOXC notified us that it elected to convert the amount of $3,891,000 under the MOXC Note into 3,891,000 shares of the MOXC Common Stock at the conversion price of $1.00 (the “August Conversion”). As a result of the August Conversion, the remainder amount of the MOXC Note was $3,891,000.
 
On September 30, 2015, MOXC notified us that it elected to convert the remainder of the MOXC Note, of $3,891,000 into 3,891,000 shares of the MOXC Common Stock (the “September Conversion”). After the August Conversion and the September Conversion, consequently, all of the MOXC Note was converted in to the total of 7,782,000 shares of the MOXC Common Stock with no amount of the MOXC Note outstanding.  On May 24, 2016, MOXC’s Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split of MOXC’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock, at a ratio of 1-for-2 (the “MOXC Reverse Stock Split”). The MOXC Reverse Stock Split was effective on June 20, 2016, and pursuant to the MOXC Reverse Stock Split, the Company’s shares in MOXC were reduced from 7,782,000 shares to 3,891,000 shares.

Plan and Completion of Disposition
 
On January 30, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved and submitted for approval of the Company’s shareholders with a majority of voting rights, a Plan of Disposition (“Plan of Disposition”). Under the Plan of Disposition, the Company proposed to distribute the proceeds resulting from the Equity Transfer Transaction and Sale of Moxian BVI, within one year from the date of the Equity Transfer Transaction, to the shareholders as of January 29, 2015, on a pro-rata basis except for Rebel FC Stockholder, who agreed to waive such proceeds. On January 30, 2015, the Company’s shareholders with a majority of voting rights approved the Plan of Disposition. No additional vote of the Company’s shareholders was required or sought in connection with the Plan of Disposition, and the Company’s record shareholders had no appraisal rights in connection with the proposed transactions under the Plan of Disposition.  The Plan of Disposition was not completed within the planned one year period, and was delayed due to MOXC’s then proposed underwritten offering and exchange listing. On May 24, 2016, due to the MOXC Reverse Stock Split, effective on June 20, 2016, the Company’s shares in MOXC were reduced from 7,782,000 shares to 3,891,000 shares. The Company is in the process of preparing and approving a revised Plan of Disposition, which takes into account that the Company currently holds 3,891,000 shares of MOXC which are currently valued at $11,634,090 and pursuant to which the Company plans to distribute, as a dividend, the 3,891,000 MOXC shares to the Company’s shareholders as of January 29, 2015, on a pro-rata basis, that would have been entitled to share in the proceeds of the sale of the MOXC shares by the Company under the original Plan of Disposition, if the Company had consummated such sale. The common stock of MOXC is currently quoted on the Nasdaq under the symbol MOXC at a price of $3.70 per share as of April 13, 2018.
 
On January 30, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Rebel FC pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement. The acquisition was accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization effected by a Share Exchange Transaction. Rebel FC was considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes.
 
Also on January 30, 2015, we transferred 100% equity interests of Moxian IP to MOXC pursuant to the Equity Transfer Agreement. As a result of the Equity Transfer Transaction, Moxian IP ceased to be our subsidiary, and the Company changed its business from licensing intellectual property rights relating to a social network to organizing and promoting MMA fighting events in Asia.
 
Recent Developments
 
On October 1, 2017, the Company and Pure Heart Entertainment Pte Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and a company incorporated under the laws of Singapore (“Pure Heart”) entered into a Share Transfer Agreement (the “Share Transfer”) with Naixin Qi, an individual (the “Shareholder”), the sole shareholder of Qingdao Quanyao Sports Consulting Co.

Overview of Our Business
 
The Company, through its subsidiaries, organizes promotes and hosts MMA events featuring top level athletic talent and delivering top quality events centered around Chinese fighters and fans. With assistance from contracted production crews, the Company produces and distributes, through the internet and social media, and sells the rights to distribute to television stations, videos of its MMA events.
 
The Company seeks to promote MMA in China through hosting top quality matches, live TV broadcast and inspiring reality series that attract talented fighters from all over the world. MMA is unarmed combat involving the use of a combination of techniques from different disciplines of martial arts, including, without limitation, grappling, submission holds, kicking and striking. The styles of martial arts range from Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Judo, Karate, Boxing, Muay Thai, Wrestling, Jeet Kune Do, Taekwondo, Sanshou and various other forms of martial arts. Unlike boxing, where athletes can only strike with their fists and only above the belt, the fighters in MMA can use punches, kicks, elbows, knee strikes, takedowns and submissions to win a contest.
 
Production of the Company’s MMA events usually involves obtaining sponsorships, signing up fighters, securing event venues, setting up event venues, marketing its events and producing event videos. The Company’s events are broadcast through top sporting entertainment stations, while also focusing on utilizing online platforms for internet streaming in order to reach audiences. There are also pre-event shows at its live events, which include music performances and fighters’ interviews and documentaries. .
 
In addition to television broadcasting, the Company plans to attract pay-per-view (“PPV”) audiences. The Company believes that the PPV model can be deployed in China in 2019 with support from selected service providers to enable paid online streaming of the Company’s MMA events. Currently the Company is still in negotiation with service providers for PPV.

Our Events
 
The Company hosts live events in which highly skilled fighters from different martial arts backgrounds compete at different weight classes. We also integrate the introduction of background information and stories of the athletes into the broadcasting of fighting events.
 
The Company selects fighters with a distinguished career for a planned event. After a careful selection process, we market our MMA events by posting on social media or broadcasting through TV channels, social media platforms, video journals and interviews of the fighters.
 
The Company has successfully hosted six events to date.
 
The Company successfully held two events in 2017. On August 12, 2017, an event titled Battle Royal: Quest for Glory was held at Kerry Hotel in Pudong, Shanghai together with Quanyao. On September 2, 2017, the Company held another event titled China vs. The World at Shenzhen Stadium in Shenzhen together with Quanyao. Shenzhen event was broadcast live on Qingdao TV and several major social media platforms. For the two events in year 2017, Quanyao paid Pure Heart USD$200,000 per event for royalty and management fee in accordance with 2017 Cooperation Agreement.
 
The Company plans to hold eight events in 2018 with two in Shanghai, two in Guangzhou, two in Shenzhen, and two in Beijing. The first event in 2018 will be held on April 29, 2018 at the Kerry Hotel in Shanghai. Events in 2018 will be broadcast live by Guangdong Sports TV, and other satellite TV stations and social media platforms where negotiations are ongoing. However, there can be no assurance that such events will occur, or even if they do occur there can be no guarantee that such events will be successful or profitable.
 
Rules of MMA
 
There is no official or non-official organization or association governing the MMA industry. However, different promoters have agreed that their MMA fighting events would abide by the Unified Rules of MMA, adopted by all state athletic commissions in the United States as well as many other promoting organizations under various jurisdictions worldwide.
 
One of the basic rules of MMA is that fighters shall not fight against another fighter of a different weight class. Another rule is that fights should be held in a ring or in a fenced area. Such ring or fenced area has to meet specific requirements.
 
The Company’s events follow the Unified Rules of MMA.

Fighters
 
An important element to a successful MMA event is to identify and retain suitable fighters. Prior to organizing our events, we reach out to managers of fighters in the MMA industry in search of suitable fighters for our upcoming events. We then negotiates and enters into our standard contracts with fighters. Fighters, in addition to combatting in our events, are also required to participate in our press conferences, interviews and documentaries and, from time to time, to appear on our sponsors’ commercials. In order to attract fans and media from both international and local markets, we specifically select fighters with distinguished careers, memorable personalities, and exciting fighting styles.
Development Plan

The Company plans to hold eight events in China in 2018. The Company plans to broadcast an episodic reality show aimed towards mainstream Chinese TV, which it hopes to launch in 2018. However there can be no assurance that such events will occur, or even if they do occur there can be no guarantee that such events will be successful or profitable.
Planned Activities
 
REBEL Reality Show
 
We plan to unveil in 2018 a new addition to our televised content by expanding the REBEL brand beyond the traditional sports market and into mainstream television through a 12 episode reality TV series, which we hope to air across major Chinese networks. We hope that this show will serve to cross over to mainstream fans by linking stars built over the course of a season of reality TV to REBEL live events, effectively introducing a much larger audience to our core product. We hope that the show will also serve the purpose of continuing the brand narrative, increasing awareness for live events, educating the average viewer on the dynamics and intrigue of Mixed Martial Arts, and serving as a platform to market company merchandise to a wide audience.
Revenues
 
Currently, the Company’s revenues come from the following sources:
 
9

 

Ticket Sales
 
The Company hosts live MMA fighting events in stadiums and sells tickets to audiences that attend the live events. Tickets are priced at different levels, ranging from $26 to $273, based on seating locations and availability of complimentary services, such as complimentary drinks and food, free t-shirts, etc. In addition to ticket sales, we also sell merchandise, such as gloves, T-shirt, to our audience at the live events.
 
On August 12, 2017, the Company held an event at titled Battle Royal: Quest for Glory at Kerry Hotel in Pudong, Shanghai together with Quanyao. On September 2, 2017, the Company held another event titled China vs. the World at Shenzhen Stadium in Shenzhen together with Quanyao. For the two events in year 2017, Quanyao paid Pure Heart USD$200,000 per event for royalty and management fee in accordance with 2017 Cooperation Agreement.
 
Central to the success of the Company’s live events is our ability to sell tickets in the most efficient and effective method possible. Due to the nature of the international combat sports market and the events production market in general, we rely on a variety of ticketing agents to assist us in distributing tickets through their extensive personal databases. These agents will vary depending on the chosen event venue and other pre-event stipulations. Through the combination of reliable agents and our own streamlined marketing systems we believe it will be possible to maintain a successful online ticket distribution presence for each live event in China.
 
The Company plans to hold eight events in 2018 in China and plans to charge between RMB 180 to 1,880 (US $26 to US $273) for tickets to these planned events, with the final price to be determined based on the location of the event. The first event in 2018 will be held on April 29, 2018 at the Kerry Hotel in Shanghai. However, there can be no assurance that such events will occur, or even if they do occur there can be no guarantee that such events will be successful or profitable.
 
Sponsorship
 
Sponsorship to our events is in forms of cash, provision of event venues, equipment and marketing campaign services. Our business model is to obtain sponsorships that are sufficient to cover the costs of hosting an event prior to incurring substantial costs for organizing an event. In consideration of the provided sponsorship, our sponsors have exposure in our promotional campaigns in connection with our events, including printing sponsors’ names and logos on banners and posters at our events, offering sponsors’ products to the audience at our events, allowing sponsors’ advertisements on our pre-event shows, on our social media pages as well as our website and allowing fighters to feature in sponsors’ commercials. We work with the sponsors to customize the promotional methods to achieve the sponsors’ marketing goals. For each event, we target to obtain at least 10 sponsors. We are also seeking to obtain sponsors for our planned reality show.
 
TV Distribution
 
Rebel FC has staff and personnel with the ability to create and produce its live events and sell the rights to broadcast its events to television stations in Singapore and China. We intend to distribute our event programs internationally through television distribution agents for a more stable stream of income. In addition to the broadcast of our live shows and other aired pre-fight footage, we will also look to secure broadcasting rights for other viable related programming such as the Rebel FC Reality TV Show that we hope will appeal to a larger fan base and can be used to integrate new fans into our live product.

Pay-Per-View
 
Pay-per-view (“PPV”) is a type of pay television and online service by which a subscriber can purchase events to view via private telecast or online. The PPV model is a model whereby we can broadcast live events on cooperating television stations. Audiences can pay to watch the live events on their televisions, laptops or handphones instead of going to a stadium. In China or South East Asia, PPV is relatively new and still in development, but we believe the success of PPV model in the U.S. can be achieved in Asia as well. Rebel FC plans to implement the PPV model for its live MMA events in 2019. We plan to charge $5 to $10 for each PPV event that the audience watches through PPV in China.
 
MMA Event Expenses
 
The promotion and organization of MMA events require various types of expenses, a majority of which consist of production, marketing promotion and payments to fighters. Another significant cost is venue rental fee. Other expenses and costs incurred in connection with our events include equipment rentals, and staff compensation.
Audience
 
A majority of the audiences that attended our events were male, with ages ranging from 18 to 35. Thus, this group is our targeted audience. We also have targeted marketing and sales for our events to college graduates who had watched sports television programs in the past 12 months and/or had participated in sports-oriented activities in the past 12 months. The secondary target would consist of males between 35- 45 years old and females between 18-34 years old. The gender mix would be 70% male and 30% female.
 
We believe that our targeted audience appeals to a wide array of advertising and sponsorship verticals (automotive, food and beverage, sports products, consumer electronics, consumer products), therefore enabling advertisers and sponsors to establish brand awareness and loyalty through our events.
 
Marketing Strategy
 
Marketing is essential to the Company’s operations and business. Brand awareness and engagement of our fans and general audience are key considerations in our marketing strategy. We utilize marketing and PR activities to reach out to our target audience and the mass media, including open workouts, road shows, weigh-ins and press-conferences. We also advertise our events on billboards, banners, television ads, bus stop advertisements and online advertisements. The Company also has a marketing and public relations department, which is dedicated to contacting television media and other news agencies, hosting press conferences and ensuring sufficient publicity of our events in social media and other traditional media.
 
11

 

With a focus on customer awareness and creative branding, the Company seeks to use social media to develop intensive marketing campaigns designed to attract both seasoned and new fans of combat sports. Rebel FC’s marketing strategy aims to drive traffic and audience growth through working with social media, public relations firms, strategic partnerships with television stations and sponsors, and advertising agencies. For instance, we held press conferences for MMA fans and the media to attend at all our events. We also work with gyms and fighting associations to promote our brand to their members and attract members to attend our events.
 
We believe that Rebel FC is distinguished from other MMA promotion companies in a way that we promote our events and fighters with vivid life stories of fighters, which highlight their passion for MMA. We believe that the behind-the-scene stories may attract audiences by showing how fighters grow their strength and brevity for the sports. Prior to a live event, we arrange face-to-face interactive sessions between fighters and audiences who are fans and supporters of these fighters. We believe this promotional method may allow us to communicate with the audiences and attract their attention to Rebel FC and eventually stimulate their desire to watch our events live or on other available media. During the events, we also broadcast the stories of athletes to provide deeper understanding of our audience about the fighters’ lives.
 
Although Mixed Martial Arts is still a growing industry, we believe our brand differentiates itself from other international combat sports organizations by combining entertainment and narrative to create an experience that we believe goes beyond the traditional sports experience. Using local athletes on dynamic televised live events until the public is acquainted with their personality, style, and back-story, we expect our fighters to become recognizable, not only inside the ring, but also outside it, serving as brand ambassadors for Rebel FC, our sponsors, and presenting a positive image of mixed martial arts to our fan-base and mainstream audiences.
 
Market Opportunities
 
According to IBIS World’s Martial Arts Studios market research report in November 2017, the total market size is $4 billion for mixed martial arts revenue worldwide. The industry is expected to continue growing over the next five years. (http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/martial-arts-studios.html). A robust economic recovery is expected to endow consumers with higher disposable income levels, enabling them to spend more money on martial arts instruction, particularly costly private lessons. Rising popularity of mixed martial arts will continue to drive demand for the industry.
 
There are regular MMA events hosted in the Asia Pacific region by established fight promoters. Despite being a relatively new promoter, the Company sees the opportunity for the growth of MMA in the Asian sports market, especially the untapped market in China. China has been reported to be a potentially significant market for the MMA industry (http://www.businessinsider.com/mixed-martial-arts-is-becoming-popular-in-rural-china-and-ufc-is-looking-to-capitalize-2014-8).
 
12

 

By 2020, the China’s sports industry market is expected to be worth RMB three trillion (USD434.4 billion), and around RMB five trillion by 2025 – as the Central Government throws its weight behind sport as a mainstay of both society and of the Chinese economy (http://www.atimes.com/article/chinas-vast-mma-potential-prompts-drawing-battle-lines/).
 
According to the Mailman Group in China, MMA has the largest number of references on Chinese social media, outnumbering other traditional sports, such as basket balls and footballs.
 
In addition, with the growing use of PPV in China, online video streaming sites such as Baidu and Tencent have millions of users using their App for streaming of shows. The Company is currently working with streaming platforms to market our shows, making our events available to a large population in China (http://www.boxinginsider.com/headlines/chinese-pay-per-view-could-open-up-new-vistas-with-pacquiao-bout/”).
 
Competition
 
The main players in the MMA industry include: i) Ultimate Fighting Championship (“UFC”), which has its focus on the U.S. market, ii) ONE Fighting Championship (“OFC”), which is based in Singapore and targets the Asia market and iii) Kunlun Fight, a fighting club located in China which broadcasts its events over the Chinese television channels. Despite the fact that our competitors are well established and have more funds available for marketing and producing their events than us, and are more reputable among the audiences in MMA, we are concentrating on the untapped combat sports market of China where we believe we have the resource and experience to penetrate the market and grow our business there. We seek to engage high quality producers to produce quality videos of our events. These produced videos are to be broadcasted on the internet and be shared on the social media. We believe this will allow us to expand our market shares in existing social media mediums. During the fights, we have our audience to engage with our commentators through social media. This interactive method has been used by other sports media and is assisting brands to gain a traction and proven growth record of new likes and awareness.
Employees
 
We maintain a specialized and experienced team consisting of 25 full time members based in China who are capable of leading temporary out-sourced personnel on a per event basis. We also have contract personnel for our television and live event productions.
