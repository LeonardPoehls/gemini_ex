Item 1. Business
Business Overview
We are a Delaware limited liability company. As of December 31, 2016, we operated and franchised 540 travel center, standalone convenience store and standalone restaurant locations. Our customers include trucking fleets and their drivers, independent truck drivers, highway and local motorists and casual diners. We also collect rents, royalties and other fees from our tenants and franchisees. 
As of December 31, 2016, our business included 255 travel centers in 43 states in the United States, or U.S., primarily along the U.S. interstate highway system, and the province of Ontario, Canada. Our travel centers included 178 operated under the "TravelCenters of America" and "TA" brand names, or the TA brand, and 77 operated under the "Petro Stopping Centers" and "Petro" brand names, or the Petro brand. Of our 255 travel centers at December 31, 2016, we owned 29, we leased 199, we operated two for a joint venture in which we own a noncontrolling interest and 25 were owned or leased from others by our franchisees. We operated 225 of our travel centers and franchisees operated 30 travel centers, including five we leased to franchisees. Our travel centers offer a broad range of products and services, including diesel fuel and gasoline, as well as nonfuel products and services such as truck repair and maintenance services, full service restaurants, quick service restaurants, or QSRs, and various customer amenities. We report this portion of our business as our travel center segment.
As of December 31, 2016, our business included 233 convenience stores in 11 states in the U.S. We operate our convenience stores primarily under the "Minit Mart" brand name, or the Minit Mart brand. Of these 233 convenience stores at December 31, 2016, we owned 198, we leased 32 and we operated three for a joint venture in which we own a noncontrolling interest. Our convenience stores offer gasoline as well as a variety of nonfuel products and services, including coffee, groceries, some fresh foods, and, in many stores, a QSR and/or car washes. We report this portion of our business as our convenience store segment.
As of December 31, 2016, our business included 52 standalone restaurants in 15 states in the U.S. operated primarily under the "Quaker Steak & Lube" brand name, or the QSL brand. Of our 52 standalone restaurants at December 31, 2016, we owned five, we leased seven, we operated one for a joint venture in which we own a noncontrolling interest and 39 were owned or leased from others by our franchisees. We report this portion of our business within corporate and other in our segment information.
We manage our business on the basis of two reportable segments, travel centers and convenience stores. See Note 15 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about our reportable segments. We have a single travel center located in a foreign country, Canada, that we do not consider material to our operations.
As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 14,420 people on a full time basis and 9,891 people on a part time basis at our travel centers, convenience stores and standalone restaurants and we employed an additional 893 people in field management, corporate and other roles to support our locations. Thirty-three of our employees at two travel centers are represented by unions.

Our Growth Strategy
Since 2011, a significant component of our growth strategy has been to acquire and develop additional locations. We currently intend to continue our efforts to selectively acquire and develop properties and businesses and to otherwise grow our business. See Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about our acquisitions.

• | During the period 2011 through 2016, we acquired and developed 318 travel centers, convenience stores and standalone restaurants and have invested an aggregate of $855.0 million to develop, purchase and improve these locations.


• | As of December 31, 2016, we had entered agreements to acquire a travel center and the businesses of six standalone restaurants from two of our franchisees for an aggregate purchase price of $19.1 million. To the date of this Annual Report, we completed the purchase of the six standalone restaurants and we expect to complete the remaining travel center acquisition in the first half of 2017, but this purchase is subject to conditions and may not occur, may be delayed or the terms may change.


• | During 2017, to the date of this Annual Report, we entered an agreement to acquire a travel center for a purchase price of $4.2 million. We expect to complete this acquisition in the first half of 2017, but this purchase is subject to conditions and may not occur, may be delayed or the terms may change.

As of December 31, 2016, we had in progress the construction of a travel center on previously undeveloped land we own which we expect to be completed during the first quarter of 2017. During 2016, we completed the construction of two travel centers on parcels of previously undeveloped land we owned and a travel center on owned property that previously included only a convenience store and truck repair facility. We may decide to build additional travel centers or other facilities in the future on other parcels of undeveloped land we own. We occasionally consider purchasing properties for future development and we expect to continue to do so in the future. 
We believe that in addition to growing our business through our acquisitions and development plans, we have opportunities to increase revenues and profits through continued investment in our existing properties, including continuing the renovations and stabilization of operations at locations we have acquired recently or may acquire in the future. Recent investments and improvements have included projects such as parking lot expansions, construction of additional truck repair bays, installation of car washes, restaurant remodeling, the installation of additional QSR offerings, installation of biodiesel blending equipment, installation of diesel exhaust fluid, or DEF, dispensers and the expansion of our Reserve-It!® parking, RoadSquad®, RoadSquad Connect®, RoadSquad OnSite® and TA Commercial Tire Network™ offerings. 
Typical improvements we make at acquired travel centers include adding truck repair facilities and nationally branded QSRs, paving parking lots, rebranding gasoline offerings, replacing outdated fuel dispensers, installing DEF dispensing systems, changing signage, installing point of sale and other information technology, or IT, systems and general building and cosmetic upgrades. The cost of capital improvements to recently purchased travel centers and the development of new travel centers are often substantial and require a long period of time to plan, design, permit and complete; and, after being completed, the improved, or new, travel centers require a period of time to become part of our customers' supply networks and produce stabilized financial results. We estimate that the travel centers we acquire generally will reach financial stabilization approximately three years after completion of improvements or development, but actual results can vary widely from this estimate due to many factors, some of which are outside our control, and there can be no assurance that acquired locations will operate profitably. 
Typical improvements we make at acquired convenience stores include rebranding to the Minit Mart brand, adding QSRs, rebranding gasoline offerings and correction of deferred maintenance. In 2016, we acquired the Quaker Steak & Lube restaurant brand and business and are in the process of improving those operations. Improvements to our convenience store and standalone restaurants require a period of time to plan, design, permit and complete, often followed by a period of time for integration into our operations. We estimate that the convenience stores and standalone restaurants that we have acquired will generally reach financial stabilization approximately one year after acquisition, but the actual results can vary widely from the estimate due to many factors, some of which are outside our control, and there can be no assurance that acquired locations will operate profitably.

Our Travel Center and Convenience Store Locations
Travel Centers
Our typical travel center includes:

• | over 25 acres of land with parking for approximately 200 tractor trailers and 100 cars;


• | a full service restaurant and one or more QSRs that we operate as a franchisee under various brands;


• | a truck repair facility and parts store;


• | multiple diesel and gasoline fueling points, including DEF at the diesel lanes; and


• | a travel store, game room, lounge and other amenities for professional truck drivers and motorists.

Substantially all of our travel centers are full service sites located on or near an interstate highway exit and offer fuel and nonfuel products and services 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.
Our travel center locations offer a broad range of products and services designed to appeal to our customers, including:

• | Fuel. We sell diesel fuel at separate truck fueling lanes and gasoline and diesel fuel at motorist fuel islands. As of December 31, 2016, we offered branded gasoline at 238 of our 255 locations and unbranded gasoline at six of our travel centers operated by our franchisees.


• | Diesel Exhaust Fluid. DEF is an additive that is required by most truck engines manufactured after 2010. As of December 31, 2016, we offered DEF from dispensers on the diesel fueling island at all of our travel centers.


• | Full Service Restaurants and QSRs. Most of our travel centers have both full service restaurants and QSRs that offer customers a wide variety of nationally recognized branded food choices. The substantial majority of our full service restaurants within travel centers are operated under our Iron Skillet® and Country Pride® brands and offer menu table service and buffets. We also operate approximately 35 different brands of QSRs, including Arby's®, Burger King®, Dunkin' Donuts®, Pizza Hut®, Popeye's Chicken & Biscuits®, Starbuck's Coffee®, Subway® and Taco Bell®. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 200 of our travel centers included a full service restaurant, approximately 160 of our travel centers offered at least one QSR and there were a total of approximately 430 QSRs in our 255 travel centers.


• | Truck Service. Most of our travel centers have truck repair and maintenance facilities. Our 243 truck repair and maintenance facilities typically have between two and eight service bays and are staffed by mechanics and service technicians employed by us or our franchisees. These shops generally operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year and offer extensive maintenance and emergency repair and road services, ranging from basic services such as oil changes, wheel alignments and tire repair to specialty services such as diagnostics and repair of air conditioning, brakes and electrical systems and diesel filter cleaning. Our repair and maintenance services are generally covered by our warranty. Most of our truck repair and maintenance facilities provide some warranty work on Daimler Trucks North America, or Daimler, brand trucks through our participation in the Freightliner ServicePoint® and Western Star ServicePoint® programs, as described under the heading "Operations - Daimler Agreement" below.

RoadSquad® is a roadside truck service program that operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week and as of December 31, 2016, included a fleet of approximately 600 heavy duty emergency vehicles at our sites. Our service trucks are positioned at our travel centers and centrally dispatched to assist customers with repairs when they are unable to bring their trucks to our travel centers due to a break down. 
RoadSquad Connect® is our centralized call center to dispatch both our RoadSquad® vehicles and third party roadside service providers, and is designed to extend the geographic reach of RoadSquad®. RoadSquad Connect® includes service providers in 50 U.S. states and one Canadian province with a total of approximately 1,800 locations as of December 31, 2016. 
RoadSquad OnSite® offers truck and trailer repair services at customer facilities and included a fleet of approximately 90 trucks as of December 31, 2016. RoadSquad OnSite® offers various services such as pre-trip truck inspections, U.S. Department of Transportation required inspections, tire repair and replacement, marker light operation checks, brake inspections, truck refurbishings and complete lubrication services.

TA Commercial Tire Network™ is a commercial tire program that began in late 2016 through which we sell a variety of branded tires at our truck repair and maintenance facilities, on customers' lots, distribution centers, through direct sales and under tire manufacturers' national fleet account programs. We believe that the TA Commercial Tire Network™ will position us to successfully respond to customers' demands for tire brands and delivery/install services at competitive pricing. 

• | Travel Stores. Our travel stores located at a travel center have a selection of over 4,700 items, including packaged food and snack items, beverages, non-prescription drug and beauty supplies, batteries, automobile accessories, and music and video products. Each travel store also has a "to go" bar offering fresh brewed coffee, hot dogs, prepared sandwiches and other prepared foods. The travel stores in our travel centers also sell items specifically designed for the truck driver's "on the road" lifestyle, including laundry supplies, clothing, truck accessories and a variety of electronics. In 2015, we began to use Minit Mart branding at the travel stores in our travel centers; as of December 31, 2016, 47 of these include Minit Mart signage and branding elements, 22 of which were completed during 2016.


• | Parking. Our travel centers offer the Reserve-It!® parking program, which allows drivers to reserve for a fee a parking space in advance of arriving at a travel center.


• | Additional Driver Services. We believe that trucking fleets can improve the retention and recruitment of truck drivers by directing them to visit large, high quality, full service travel centers with plentiful overnight parking. We offer commercial trucker and other customer loyalty programs, the principal program being the UltraOne® Club, that are similar to the frequent shopper programs offered by other retailers. Drivers receive points for diesel fuel purchases and for spending on selected nonfuel products and services. These points may be redeemed for discounts on nonfuel products and services at our travel centers. In addition, we publish a magazine called RoadKing® which includes articles and advertising of interest to professional truck drivers. Some of our travel centers offer casino gaming. We strive to provide a consistently high level of service and amenities to professional truck drivers at all of our travel centers, making our travel centers an attractive choice for trucking fleets. Most of our travel centers provide truck drivers the amenities listed below:


• | specialized business services, including an information center where drivers can send and receive faxes, overnight mail and other communications;


• | a banking desk where drivers can cash checks and receive funds transfers from fleet operators;


• | wi-fi internet access;


• | a laundry area with washers and dryers;


• | private showers;


• | free exercise facilities; and


• | areas designated for truck drivers only, including a theater or big screen television room with a video player and comfortable seating.

Convenience Stores
Our typical convenience store includes:

• | approximately 10 fueling positions;


• | approximately 3,700 square feet of interior space;


• | at least one QSR offering; and


• | various nonfuel offerings such as coffee, groceries and fresh foods.

The majority of our convenience stores are open 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.
10

Our convenience store locations offer a broad range of products and services designed to appeal to our customers, including:

• | Fuel. We sell branded gasoline and unbranded diesel fuel at our convenience stores. As of December 31, 2016, we offered branded gasoline at all of our 233 convenience stores and offered unbranded diesel fuel at approximately 32 of our convenience stores.


• | Nonfuel Offerings. Our convenience stores generally have a selection of over 3,100 items, including packaged food and snack items, beverages, beer and wine, tobacco products, non-prescription drug and beauty supplies, batteries, and automobile accessories. Each convenience store also has a "to go" bar offering fresh brewed coffee, fountain drinks, hot dogs, prepared sandwiches and other prepared foods. As of December 31, 2016, 83 of our convenience stores also offered car washes.


• | QSRs. Many of our convenience stores have a nationally recognized branded QSR. We operate 26 different brands of QSRs at our convenience stores, including O'Deli's Subs®, Godfather's Pizza®, Hunt Brothers Pizza®, Subway® and Dunkin' Donuts®. As of December 31, 2016, 105 of our convenience stores offered at least one QSR and there were a total of 187 QSRs in our 233 convenience stores.

Operations
Our travel centers and convenience stores offer similar products and services, and utilize some of the same suppliers, as discussed further below.
Fuel. We sell fuel to our customers at prices that we establish daily or are indexed to market prices and reset daily. For the year ended December 31, 2016, diesel fuel and gasoline revenue represented approximately 74% and 26%, respectively, of our total fuel revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 79% of our diesel fuel was sold at discounts to posted prices to trucking fleet customers. We have numerous sources for our diesel fuel and gasoline supply, including nearly all of the large oil companies operating in the U.S. We purchase diesel fuel from various suppliers at rates that fluctuate with market prices and generally are reset daily. By establishing diesel fuel supply relationships with several alternate suppliers for most locations, we believe we are able to effectively create competition for our purchases among various diesel fuel suppliers. We also believe that purchasing arrangements with multiple diesel fuel suppliers may help us avoid product outages during times of diesel fuel supply disruptions. At some locations, however, there are few suppliers for diesel fuel in that market and we may have only one viable supplier. Generally we have single sources of supply for gasoline at each of our locations. We offer biodiesel at a number of our travel centers and have a limited number of suppliers for this product at those sites. 
A large majority of truck drivers use a payment method known as truck "fuel cards," which allows truck drivers to purchase fuel and other goods and services, and permits trucking companies to track fuel and other purchases made by their drivers throughout the United States. Most of our trucking customers transact business with us by use of fuel cards, most of which are issued by third party fuel card companies. The fuel card industry has only two significant participants, FleetCor Technologies, Inc., the parent of Comdata Inc., and its subsidiaries, or FleetCor, and WEX Inc., and its subsidiaries, or WEX. We believe almost all trucking companies use only one fuel card provider and have become increasingly dependent upon the data, reports and other services provided by their respective sole fuel card provider to manage their fleets and simplify their data processing.
Generally our fuel purchases are delivered directly from suppliers' terminals to our locations. We generally do not contract to purchase substantial quantities of fuel to hold as inventory. We generally have three days of diesel fuel and gasoline inventory at our travel centers, and five days of diesel fuel and gasoline inventory at our convenience stores. We believe our exposure to market price increases for diesel fuel and gasoline is partially mitigated by the significant amount of our diesel fuel and gasoline sales that are sold under arrangements that include pricing formulae that reset daily and are indexed to market prices and by us generally not purchasing fuel for delivery other than on the date of purchase. We historically have not engaged in any fixed or hedged price fuel contracts.
11

Nonfuel Products. We have many sources for the large variety of nonfuel products that we sell. We have developed supply relationships with several suppliers of certain nonfuel products, including Daimler for truck parts, Bridgestone Corporation, Continental AG, Cooper Tire and Rubber Company, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, Michelin North America, Inc., Pirelli & C. SpA and Yokohama Tire Corporation for truck tires, McLane Company, Inc. for travel and convenience store and tobacco products, U.S. Foods for restaurant food products and ExxonMobil Oil Corporation and Equilon Enterprises LLC doing business as Shell Oil Products U.S., or Shell, for lubricants. We maintain two distribution centers to distribute certain nonfuel and nonperishable products to our locations using a combination of contract carriers and our fleet of trucks and trailers. We believe these distribution centers allow us to purchase, maintain and transport inventory and supplies at lower costs.
Daimler Agreement. We are party to an agreement with Daimler that extends to July 2019. Daimler is a leading manufacturer of large trucks in North America under the Freightliner and Western Star brand names. Except for locations in Texas, our TA and Petro truck repair and maintenance facilities are, or are expected to be, authorized providers of repair work and specified warranty repairs to Daimler's customers. This is accomplished through the Freightliner ServicePoint® program at TA locations and through the Freightliner and/or Western Star ServicePoint® programs at our Petro locations. Our TA and Petro truck maintenance and repair facilities are also part of Freightliner's 24 hour customer assistance database for emergency and roadside repair referrals and we have access generally to Daimler's parts distribution, service and technical information systems.
Competition
Travel Centers
Fuel and nonfuel products and services can be obtained by trucking companies and truck drivers from a variety of sources, including national and regional full service travel centers and pumper only truck stops, some of which are owned or franchised by large chains and some of which are independently owned and operated, and some large service stations. In addition, some trucking companies operate their own terminals to provide fuel and services to their own trucking fleets and drivers. Some of our competitors may have more resources than we do and vertically integrated fuel and other businesses which may provide them competitive advantages. For all of these reasons and others, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully.
We believe that although the travel center and truck stop industry is highly fragmented, with approximately 6,400 travel centers and truck stops in the U.S., the largest trucking fleets tend to purchase the majority of their fuel from us and our two largest competitors. We believe that large trucking fleets and long haul trucking fleets tend to purchase the large majority of their fuel at the approximately 1,900 travel centers and truck stops that are located at or near interstate highway exits. Based on the number of locations, TA, Pilot Travel Centers LLC, or Pilot, and Love's Travel Stops and Country Stores, Inc., or Love's, are the three largest companies focused principally on the travel center industry. We believe that, during 2016, both of our principal competitors, Pilot and Love's, have added more travel centers to their networks than we have to our network, and in some cases competition from new sites added by Pilot and Love's has negatively impacted our unit results. Nevertheless, we believe we are able to compete successfully in part because many of our travel centers were originally developed years ago when prime real estate locations along the interstate highway system were more readily available than they are today, which we believe would make it difficult to fully replicate our travel center business. 
We compete with other travel center and truck stop chains based primarily on diesel fuel prices and the quality, variety and pricing of our nonfuel products, services and amenities. Our truck repair and maintenance facilities compete with other providers of truck repair and maintenance facilities, including some at Pilot and Love's locations. These two competitors have increased their respective numbers of truck repair and maintenance facilities over the past few years; however, they do not currently offer as large a network of repair and maintenance facilities as we do and generally do not offer the breadth of services that we offer. For truck maintenance and repair services, we also compete with regional full service travel center and smaller truck stop chains, full service independently owned and operated travel centers and truck stops, fleet maintenance terminals, independent garages, truck and commercial tire dealerships, truck quick lube facilities and other parts and service centers. We also compete with other full service restaurants, QSRs, mass merchandisers, electronics stores, drugstores, gasoline stations and convenience stores. Some truck fleets own their own fuel, repair and maintenance facilities; however, we believe the long term trend has been toward a reduction in these facilities in favor of obtaining fuel, repair and maintenance services from third parties like us. We believe that we are able to compete successfully because we offer consistent, high quality products and services, and our nationwide travel centers provide an advantage to large trucking fleets, particularly long haul trucking fleets, by enabling them to (i) take advantage of efficiencies afforded by the wide array of products and services our travel centers provide for their equipment and their drivers and (ii) reduce the number of their suppliers by routing their trucks through our travel centers nationwide.
12

An additional source of competition in the future could result from commercialization of state owned interstate highway rest areas. Some state governments have historically requested that the federal government allow these rest areas to offer fuel and nonfuel products and services similar to that offered at a travel center and certain congressional leaders have historically supported such legislation. If commercialized, these rest areas may increase the number of locations competing with us and these rest areas may have significant competitive advantages over existing travel centers, including ours, because they are generally located on restricted (i.e., toll) roads and have dedicated ingress and egress.
Convenience Stores
The convenience store industry is highly competitive with ease of entry and constant changes in the number and types of retailers offering products and services similar to those we offer. Fuel, food, including prepared foods, and nonfood items similar or identical to those sold by us are generally available from various competitors in the communities we serve, including other convenience store chains, independent convenience store operators, supermarkets, drug stores, discount clubs, motor fuel service stations, discount retail chains or independent stores, fast food operations, gasoline stations and other retail stores. We believe our stores compete principally with local grocery stores, restaurants, larger gasoline stations offering a more limited selection of grocery and food items for sale and other convenience stores. As of December 31, 2016, the U.S. convenience store industry consisted of approximately 154,000 convenience stores. Based on the number of our locations, including the convenience store operations within our travel centers, we believe we currently are one of the 25 largest convenience store operators in the convenience store industry. 
Our Leases with HPT
We have five leases with Hospitality Properties Trust, or HPT, four leases for an aggregate of 158 properties, which we refer to collectively as the TA Leases, and a fifth lease for 40 travel center properties, which we refer to as the Petro Lease. We refer to the four TA Leases and the Petro Lease collectively as the HPT Leases. One of our subsidiaries is a tenant under the leases, and we, and in the case of our TA Leases certain of our subsidiaries, guarantee the tenants' obligations under the leases. The following is a summary of the material terms of these leases, as amended.
Term. The TA Leases expire on December 31, 2026, 2028, 2029 and 2030, respectively. The Petro Lease expires on June 30, 2032. We may extend each of these leases for up to two additional periods of 15 years.
Rent. As of December 31, 2016, the HPT Leases require us to pay aggregate minimum rent to HPT in an amount of $272.0 million per year. We may request that HPT purchase approved renovations, improvements and equipment additions we make at the leased properties, in return for an increase in our minimum annual rent equal to the amount paid by HPT times the greater of (i) 8.5% or (ii) a benchmark U.S. Treasury interest rate plus 3.5%. HPT is not required to purchase any improvements and we are not required to sell any improvements to HPT.
Percentage Rent. Under the HPT Leases, we incur percentage rent payable to HPT. The percentage rent is 3% of the excess of gross nonfuel revenues for any particular year over the percentage rent base year amount. HPT had agreed to waive payment of the first $2.5 million of percentage rent that may become due under our Petro Lease, and through December 31, 2016, HPT has waived, in aggregate, all of the $2.5 million of percentage rent to be waived.
Deferred Rent. We owe deferred rent to HPT in an aggregate amount of $150.0 million, of which $42.9 million, $29.3 million, $29.1 million, $27.4 million and $21.2 million will be due and payable on June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2026, 2028, 2029 and 2030, respectively. Interest does not accrue on this deferred rent obligation, subject to exceptions. This deferred rent obligation may be accelerated by HPT and become due on an earlier date and interest shall begin to accrue thereon upon the occurrence of certain events, including a change of control in us.
Maintenance and Alterations. We must maintain, at our expense, the leased properties, including maintenance of structural and non-structural components. At the end of each lease we must surrender the leased properties in substantially the same condition as existed at the commencement of the lease subject to any permitted alterations and reasonable wear and tear.
Assignment and Subletting. HPT's consent is required for any direct or indirect assignment or sublease of any of the leased properties. We remain liable under the leases for subleased properties.
13

Indemnification and Insurance. With limited exceptions, we indemnify HPT for certain environmental matters and for liabilities that arise during the terms of the leases from ownership or operation of the leased properties. We generally must maintain commercially reasonable insurance. Our insurance coverage requirements include:

• | property insurance in an amount equal to the full replacement cost of at risk improvements at our leased properties;


• | business interruption insurance;


• | general liability insurance, including bodily injury and property damage, in amounts that are generally maintained by companies operating travel centers;


• | flood insurance for any property located in whole or in part in a flood plain;


• | workers' compensation insurance if required by law; and


• | such additional insurance as may be generally maintained by companies operating travel centers, including certain environmental insurance.

The HPT Leases generally require that HPT be named as an additional insured under our insurance policies.
Damage, Destruction or Condemnation. If any leased property is damaged by fire or other casualty or taken by eminent domain, we are generally obligated to rebuild. If the leased property cannot be restored, HPT will generally receive all insurance or taking proceeds, we are liable to HPT for any deductible or deficiency between the replacement cost and the amount of such proceeds, and the annual minimum rent will be reduced by (i) in the case of the TA Leases, at HPT's option, either 8.5% of the net proceeds paid to HPT or the fair market rental of the damaged, destroyed or condemned property, or portion thereof, as of the commencement date of the TA Leases; (ii) in the case of a casualty loss under the Petro Lease, 8.5% of the net proceeds paid to HPT plus 8.5% of the fair market value of the land; and (iii) in the case of a taking under the Petro Lease, 8.5% of the amount of the net proceeds paid to HPT.
Events of Default. Events of default under each lease include the following:

• | our failure to pay rent or any other amounts when due;


• | our failure to maintain the insurance required under the lease;


• | the occurrence of certain events with respect to our insolvency;


• | the institution of a proceeding for our bankruptcy or dissolution;


• | our failure to continuously operate any leased properties without HPT's consent;


• | the acquisition by any person or group of beneficial ownership of 9.8% or more of our voting shares or the power to direct the management and policies of us or any of our subsidiary tenants or guarantors; the sale of a material part of the assets of us or any such tenant or guarantor; or the cessation of certain continuing directors constituting a majority of the board of directors of us or any such tenant or guarantor; in each case without the consent of HPT;


• | our default under any indebtedness of $10.0 million or more for the TA Leases, or $20.0 million or more for the Petro Lease, that gives the holder the right to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness; and


• | our failure to perform certain other covenants or agreements of the lease and the continuance thereof for a specified period of time after written notice.

14

Remedies. Following the occurrence of any event of default, each lease provides that, among other things, HPT may, to the extent legally permitted:

• | accelerate the rent;


• | terminate the lease; and/or


• | make any payment or perform any act required to be performed by us under the lease and receive from us, on demand, an amount equal to the amount so expended by HPT plus interest.

We are also obligated to reimburse HPT for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with any exercise of the foregoing remedies.
Lease Subordination. Each lease may be subordinated to any mortgages of the leased properties by HPT, but HPT is required to obtain nondisturbance agreements for our benefit.
Financing Limitations; Security. Without HPT's prior written consent, our tenant subsidiaries may not incur debt secured by any of their assets used in the operation of the leased properties; provided, however, our tenant subsidiaries may incur purchase money debt to acquire assets used in these operations and we may encumber such assets to obtain a line of credit secured by our tenant subsidiaries' receivables, inventory or certain other assets used in these operations.
Lease Termination. When a lease terminates, any equipment, furniture, fixtures, inventory and supplies at the leased properties that we own may be purchased by HPT at its then fair market value. Also at termination of the TA Leases, HPT has the right to license any of our software used in the operation of the leased properties at its then fair market value and to offer employment to employees at the leased properties; and under the HPT Leases we have agreed to cooperate in the transfer of permits, agreements and the like necessary for the operation of the leased properties.
Territorial Restrictions. Under the terms of each lease, without the consent of HPT, we generally cannot own, franchise, finance, operate, lease or manage any travel center or similar property within 75 miles in either direction along the primary interstate on which a travel center owned by HPT is located.
Right of First Refusal. We have granted to HPT in the HPT Leases a right of first refusal to acquire or finance any properties that we determine to acquire.
Non-Economic Properties. If during a lease term the continued operation of any leased property becomes non-economic in our reasonable determination and we and HPT cannot agree on an alternative use for the property, we may offer that property for sale, including the sale of HPT's interest in the property, free and clear of our leasehold interests. No sale of a property leased from HPT, however, may be completed without HPT's consent. In the event we obtain a bona-fide offer to purchase the property and HPT consents to the sale, the net sale proceeds received will be paid to HPT, exclusive of amounts associated with our personal property, which we can elect to sell to the buyers or keep, and the annual minimum rent payable shall be reduced. In the case of the TA Leases, this rent reduction will be, at HPT's option, either the amount of such proceeds times 8.5% or the fair market rental for such property as of the commencement date of the lease; in the case of the Petro Lease, this reduction will be the amount of such proceeds times 8.5%. If we obtain a bona-fide offer to purchase the property but HPT does not consent to the sale of the property, that property will no longer be part of the lease and the minimum rent will be reduced as if the sale had been completed at the amount offered. No more than a total of 15 properties subject to the TA Leases and no more than five properties subject to the Petro Lease may be offered for sale as non-economic properties during the applicable lease term.
Arbitration. Our leases with HPT also include arbitration provisions for the resolution of disputes, claims and controversies.
See Note 7 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about the terms of the HPT Leases and related amounts.

(1) | Since December 31, 2016, to the date of this Annual Report we acquired six standalone restaurants in Pennsylvania that were owned and operated by one of our franchisees, and this franchise agreement was terminated as part of the acquisition.

TA and Petro Franchise Agreements 
Material provisions of our TA and Petro travel center franchise agreements typically include the following:
Initial Franchise Fee. The initial franchise fee for a new TA or Petro franchise is $1.0 million.
Term of Agreement. The initial term of a franchise agreement is generally 10 to 15 years. Our TA franchise agreements generally provide for two five year renewals on the terms then being offered to prospective franchisees at the time of the franchise renewal and our Petro franchise agreements generally provide for two five year renewals on the same terms as the expiring agreements. As of December 31, 2016, our franchise agreements had an average remaining term excluding renewal options of five years and an average remaining term including renewal options of 10 years.
16

Protected Territory. Under the terms of our franchise agreements for TA travel centers, generally we have agreed not to operate, or allow another person to operate, a travel center or travel center business that uses the TA brand in a specified territory for that TA branded franchise travel center. Under the terms of our franchise agreements for Petro travel centers, generally we have agreed not to operate, or allow another person to operate, a travel center or travel center business that uses the Petro brand in a specified territory for that Petro branded franchise travel center.
Restrictive Covenants. Generally our franchisees may not operate any travel center or truck stop related business under a franchise agreement, licensing agreement or marketing plan or system of another person or entity. If the franchisee owns the franchised premises, generally for a two year period after expiration or earlier termination of our franchise agreement the franchisee may not operate the premises under a competitive brand.
Nonfuel Product Offerings. Franchisees are required to operate their travel centers in conformity with guidelines that we establish and offer any products and services that we deem to be a standard product or service in our travel centers.
Fuel Purchases, Sales and Royalties. Our franchise agreements require the franchisee to pay us a royalty fee per gallon of fuel sold based on sales of certain fuels at the franchised travel center, unless they purchase their fuel inventory from us. We also purchase receivables generated by some of our franchisees in connection with sales to common trucking fleet customers through our proprietary billing system on a non-recourse basis in return for a fee.
Royalty Payments on Nonfuel Revenues. Franchisees are required to pay us a royalty fee generally equal to between 2.0% and 4.0% of nonfuel revenues, in some cases up to a threshold amount, with a lower percentage fee payable on amounts in excess of the threshold amount and on revenues from branded QSRs. 
Advertising, Promotion and Image Enhancement. Our franchisees are required to make additional payments to us as contributions to the applicable brand wide advertising, marketing and promotional expenses we incur.
Termination/Nonrenewal. Generally, we may terminate or refuse to renew a franchise agreement for default by the franchisee. Generally, we may also refuse to renew if we determine that renewal would not be in our economic interest or, in the case of TA franchisees and Petro franchisees under our current form of franchise agreement, if the franchisee will not agree to the terms in our then current form of franchise agreement.
Rights of First Refusal. During the term of each franchise agreement, we generally have a right of first refusal to purchase that facility at the price offered to a franchisee by a third party. In addition, some of our agreements give us a right to purchase the franchised center for fair market value, as determined by the parties or an independent appraiser, upon expiration or earlier termination of the franchise agreement.
Franchisee Lease Agreements
In addition to franchise fees, we also collect rent from franchisees who lease their respective travel centers from us. At December 31, 2016, there were five such leased franchisee travel centers. The current terms of the five lease agreements end between June and September 2017. Four of the five leases have one renewal option for an additional five year period; the fifth lease has no renewal option. The leases require that the franchisees notify us of their intent to renew the lease at least 90 days but not more than 180 days prior to the expiration of the current term. Among other things, renewal is contingent upon the franchisee not being in default under the expiring lease and executing our then current form of lease, the terms of which may differ from the expiring lease, including without limitation, increased rent.
QSL Franchise Agreements 
Material provisions of our QSL franchise agreements typically include the following:
Initial Franchise Fee. The initial franchise fee for a new QSL franchise is $40.0 thousand. If a franchisee chooses to develop a location within a specified development area, the franchisee is required to pay an initial development fee of $20.0 thousand per restaurant.
Term of Agreement. The initial term of a QSL franchise agreement is generally 10 to 20 years. Our QSL franchise agreements generally provide for a 10 year renewal on the terms then being offered to prospective franchisees at the time of the franchise renewal. As of December 31, 2016, our franchise agreements had an average remaining term excluding renewal options of 12 years and an average remaining term including renewal options of 21 years.
17

Protected Territory. Under the terms of our franchise agreements, generally we have agreed not to operate, or allow another person to operate, a restaurant in a specified territory. In addition, the franchisees have agreed not to operate a similar restaurant within a specified territory, for a minimum of two years commencing on the effective date of the agreement.
Restaurant Offerings. Franchisees are required to operate their restaurants in conformity with the image of QSL and agree to prepare, sell and offer only those menu items that have been approved by us. 
Royalty Payments on Net Revenues. QSL franchisees are required to pay us a royalty fee on net sales, which includes sales of all goods and merchandise, or services, equal to between 4.0% to 5.0%. 
Advertising, Promotion and Image Enhancement. Our franchisees are required to make additional payments to us as contributions to the applicable brand wide advertising, marketing and promotional expenses we incur. In addition, franchisees are required to spend an agreed upon percentage of net revenue on local advertising.
Termination/Nonrenewal. Generally, we may terminate or refuse to renew a franchise agreement for default by the franchisee. 
Rights of First Refusal. During the term of each franchise agreement, we generally have a right of first refusal to purchase that facility at the price offered to a franchisee by a third party.
Regulatory Environment
Environmental Regulation
Extensive environmental laws regulate our operations and properties. These laws may require us to investigate and clean up hazardous substances, including petroleum or natural gas products, released at our owned and leased properties. Governmental entities or third parties may hold us liable for property damage and personal injuries, and for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs incurred in connection with any contamination and regulatory compliance at our locations. We use both underground storage tanks and above ground storage tanks to store petroleum products, natural gas and other hazardous substances at our locations. We must comply with environmental laws regarding tank construction, integrity testing, leak detection and monitoring, overfill and spill control, release reporting and financial assurance for corrective action in the event of a release. At some locations we must also comply with environmental laws relative to vapor recovery or discharges to water. Under the terms of the HPT Leases, we generally have agreed to indemnify HPT for any environmental liabilities related to properties that we lease from HPT and we are required to pay all environmental related expenses incurred in the operation of the leased properties. Under an agreement with Shell, we have agreed to indemnify Shell and its affiliates from certain environmental liabilities incurred with respect to our travel centers where Shell has installed natural gas fueling lanes.
For further information about these and other environmental and climate change matters, see the disclosure under the heading "Environmental Contingencies" in Note 13 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report. In addition, for more information about these environmental and climate change matters and about the risks which may arise as a result, see elsewhere in this Annual Report, including "Warning Concerning Forward Looking Statements," Item 1A, "Risk Factors," and Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis—Environmental and Climate Change Matters."
Franchise Regulation
Subject to certain exemptions, the Federal Trade Commission regulations require that we make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees and some states require state registration and delivery of specified disclosure documentation to potential franchisees. Some state laws also impose restrictions on our ability to terminate or not renew franchises and impose other limitations on the terms of our franchise relationships or the conduct of our franchise business. The Petroleum Marketing Practices Act imposes special regulations on franchises where petroleum products are offered for sale. Also, a number of states include, within the scope of their petroleum franchising statutes, prohibitions against price discrimination and other allegedly anticompetitive conduct. These provisions supplement applicable federal and state antitrust laws. We believe that we are in compliance with all franchise laws applicable to our business.
18

Gaming Regulation
As a result of our involvement in gaming operations at some of our travel centers operated through certain of our subsidiaries, we and such subsidiaries, which we refer to as our licensed subsidiaries, are currently subject to gaming regulations in Illinois, Louisiana, Montana and Nevada. Requirements under gaming regulations vary by jurisdiction but include, among other things:

• | findings of suitability by the relevant gaming authorities with respect to, or licensure of, certain of our and our licensed subsidiaries' officers, directors and key employees and certain individuals having a material relationship with us or our licensed subsidiaries;


• | findings of suitability by the relevant gaming authorities with respect to certain of our security holders and restrictions on ownership of certain of our securities;


• | prior approval in certain circumstances by the relevant gaming authorities of offerings of our securities;


• | prior approval by the relevant gaming authorities of changes in control of us; and


• | specified reporting requirements.

Holders of beneficial interests in our voting securities are subject to licensing or suitability investigations by the relevant gaming authorities under various circumstances including, generally, service on our Board of Directors, the attainment of certain levels of ownership of a class of voting securities, or involvement in the gaming operations of or influence over us or our licensed subsidiaries. Persons or entities seeking to acquire control over us or over operation of the license are subject to prior investigation by and approval from the relevant gaming authorities. Any beneficial owner of our voting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required by a relevant gaming authority to file an application and have their suitability reviewed in certain circumstances, including if the gaming authority has reason to believe that such ownership of our voting securities would otherwise be inconsistent with its state's gaming laws. In some jurisdictions, the applicant must pay all costs of investigations incurred in connection with such investigations. Additionally, in the event of a finding by a relevant gaming authority that a person or entity is unsuitable to be an owner of our securities, such person would be prohibited from, among other things, receiving any dividend or interest upon such securities, exercising any voting right conferred through such securities or continuing to hold our securities beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by such gaming authority, managing the licensed business and, in some cases, the shareholder may be required to divest himself or itself of our voting securities.
Certain of our and our subsidiaries' officers and directors must also file applications, be investigated and be licensed or found suitable by the relevant gaming authorities in order to hold such positions. In the event of a finding by a relevant gaming authority that a director, officer, key employee or individual with whom we or our licensed subsidiary have a material relationship is unsuitable, we or our licensed subsidiary, as applicable, may be required to sever our relationships with such individual or such individual may be prohibited from serving as our director or officer.
Any violations by us or any of our licensed subsidiaries of the gaming regulations to which we are subject could result in fines, penalties (including the limiting, conditioning, suspension or revocation of any licenses held) and criminal actions. Additionally, certain jurisdictions, such as Nevada, empower their regulators to investigate participation by licensees in gaming outside their jurisdiction and require access to periodic reports regarding those gaming activities. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.
On August 5, 2016, our Board of Directors approved and adopted a Gaming Compliance Plan, or the Compliance Plan, as required by the Nevada Gaming Commission in connection with the gaming operations at certain of our travel center locations. In connection with its adoption of the Compliance Plan, the Board established a Gaming Compliance Committee, or the Compliance Committee, and designated a member of the Audit Committee of the Board to serve as the Board's liaison to the Compliance Committee pursuant to the terms of the Compliance Plan. 
Seasonality
Our sales volumes are generally lower in the first and fourth quarters than the second and third quarters of each year. In the first quarter, the movement of freight by professional truck drivers as well as motorist travel are usually at their lowest levels of each calendar year. In the fourth quarter, freight movement is typically lower due to the holiday season. While our revenues are modestly seasonal, the quarterly variations in our operating results may reflect greater seasonal differences as our rent and certain other costs do not vary seasonally.

Intellectual Property
We own the "Petro Stopping Centers," "Minit Mart" and "Quaker Steak & Lube" names and related trademarks and various trade names used in our business including RoadSquad®, RoadSquad Connect®, RoadSquad OnSite®, TA Commercial Tire Network™, UltraOne®, Iron Skillet®, Reserve-It!®, eShop® and others. We have the right to use the "TA," "TravelCenters of America," Country Pride® and certain other trademarks, which are owned by HPT, during the terms of each of the four TA Leases. We also license certain trademarks used in the operation of certain of our QSRs and convenience stores and may in the future license trademarks to be used in the operation of one or more of our full service restaurants. We believe that these trademarks are important to our business, but that they could be replaced with alternative trademarks without significant disruption in our business except for the cost of such changes, which may be significant.
