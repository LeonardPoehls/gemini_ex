ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Cloudera empowers organizations to become data‑driven enterprises. We have developed the modern platform for machine learning and analytics, optimized for the cloud. We collaborate extensively with the global open source community, continuously innovate in data management technologies and leverage the latest advances in infrastructure including the public cloud for “big data” applications. Our pioneering hybrid open source software (HOSS) model incorporates the best of open source with our robust proprietary software to form an enterprise‑grade platform. This platform delivers an integrated suite of capabilities for data management, machine learning and advanced analytics, affording customers an agile, scalable and cost effective solution for transforming their businesses. Our platform enables organizations to use vast amounts of data from a variety of sources, including the Internet of Things (IoT), to better serve and market to their customers, design connected products and services and reduce risk through greater insight from data. 
Our scale‑out distributed architecture delivers high performance on inexpensive industry‑standard hardware and cloud infrastructure. We allow enterprises to operate, manage and move workloads across multiple architectures, mixing on‑premises and cloud environments, including all major public cloud infrastructure providers – Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform – as well as managed service providers (MSPs). We also enable enterprises’ “multi‑cloud” strategies, allowing them to move workloads from the data center to the public cloud, among public cloud vendors, and back again, thus avoiding cloud lock‑in. This flexibility allows customers to continually determine and implement the most cost‑efficient strategies. 
We offer our software platform primarily on a subscription basis and focus our selling efforts on the largest corporate enterprises and public sector organizations globally. We target these organizations because they capture and manage the majority of the world’s data and operate highly complex IT environments. These organizations are likely to realize the greatest value from our enterprise‑grade platform. We have achieved significant growth and global scale in a relatively short period of time. Our customers continue to expand their usage of our platform. The net expansion rate for our subscription revenue was 136% as of January 31, 2018. A growing, vibrant ecosystem of systems integrators, software developers, resellers, OEMs, data systems vendors and public cloud providers has developed around our platform. As part of this ecosystem, we have developed a strategic partnership with Intel Corporation, or Intel, to optimize our software for use with Intel processors and architecture.

Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and we seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality agreements, licenses and intellectual property assignment agreements. We maintain a policy requiring our employees, contractors, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements to control access to our proprietary information. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Furthermore, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we therefore may be unable to protect our proprietary technology in certain jurisdictions. Moreover, our platform incorporates software components licensed to the general public under open source software licenses such as the Apache 2.0 Software License. We obtain many components from software developed and released by contributors to independent open source components of our platform. Open source licenses grant licensees broad permissions to use, copy, modify and redistribute our platform. As a result, open source development and licensing practices can limit the value of our software copyright assets. 
As of January 31, 2018, we had been granted 27 U.S. patents and had 15 U.S. patent applications pending. Our patents expire between 2030 and 2035. We also had nine issued patents and four patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. To protect our brand, we file trademark registrations in some jurisdictions
Employees
As of January 31, 2018, we had 1,648 full‑time employees. Of these employees, 1,134 are in the United States and 514 are in our international locations. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
