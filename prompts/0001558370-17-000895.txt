 Overview
 Leaf Group is a diversified Internet company that builds platforms across our marketplace and media properties to enable communities of creators to reach passionate audiences in large and growing lifestyle categories. In addition, our diverse advertising offerings help brands and publishers find innovative ways to engage with their customers.    Our business is comprised of two service offerings: Marketplaces and Media.
· | Marketplaces: Through our Marketplaces service offering, we operate leading art and design marketplaces where large communities of artists can market and sell their original artwork or their original designs printed on a wide variety of products. Society6.com (“Society6”) provides artists with an online commerce platform to feature and sell their original designs on an array of consumer products in the home décor, accessories, and apparel categories. SaatchiArt.com (“Saatchi Art”) is an online art gallery featuring a wide selection of original paintings, drawings, sculptures and photography that provides a global community of artists with a curated environment in which to exhibit and sell their work directly to consumers around the world. Our Marketplaces service offering also includes The Other Art Fair, a leading London-based art fair for discovering emerging artists that complements our Saatchi Art online marketplace.

· | Media: Our Media service offering includes our leading owned and operated media properties that publish content, including videos, articles and designed visual formats, on various category-specific properties with distinct editorial voices. Our media properties include Livestrong.com, a health and healthy living destination; eHow, a do-it-yourself reference destination; and over 40 other media properties focused on specific categories or interests that we either own and operate or host and operate for our partners. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our Marketplaces service offering primarily generates revenue from the sale of products and services through our art and design marketplaces. Our Media service offering generates the majority of its revenue from the sale of advertising on our media properties. We also generate revenue from the sale or license of media content, including the creation and distribution of content for third party brands and publishers through our content studio. Information about our revenue by service offering is set forth in Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15, “Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Separation
 On August 1, 2014, we completed the separation of Rightside Group, Ltd. (“Rightside”) from the Company, resulting in two independent, publicly traded companies (hereinafter referred to as the “Separation”). Following the Separation, Rightside operates our former domain name services business, while we continue to own and operate our Marketplaces and Media businesses. The Separation was structured as a pro rata tax-free dividend involving the distribution of all outstanding shares of Rightside common stock to holders of our common stock as of the August 1, 2014 record date (the “Distribution”). Immediately following the Distribution, we completed a 1-for-5 reverse stock split of our outstanding and treasury shares of common stock. The financial results of Rightside are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods prior to fiscal year 2015 presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Sale of Cracked Business
 In April 2016, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets relating to our Cracked business, including the Cracked.com humor website, to Scripps Media, Inc., a subsidiary of The E.W. Scripps Company, for a cash purchase price of $39.0 million. Additional financial information relating to the Cracked business for the relevant periods is set forth below under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Content Studio Realignment
 In June 2016, we took certain actions to streamline our content publishing studio business (formerly known as studioD) and better integrate the business into our broader Media service offering. As part of this realignment, we reduced the staffing within this business by 35 full-time employees and integrated the remaining employees into our other Media businesses. Following this realignment, we are continuing to create content for third party publishers and brands using a more integrated approach.   Rebrand to Leaf Group Ltd.
 Leaf Group Ltd. was incorporated in Delaware in March 2006 as Demand Media, Inc. As part of our evolution from a pure digital media company to a diversified marketplaces and media company, our corporate name changed from Demand Media, Inc. to Leaf Group Ltd. effective November 9, 2016. We also commenced trading under the ticker symbol “LFGR” on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) as of market open on November 9, 2016. Our headquarters are located in Santa Monica, California.  Marketplaces 
 Our Marketplaces service offering includes Society6, which we acquired in June 2013; Saatchi Art, which we acquired in August 2014; and The Other Art Fair, which we acquired in July 2016. Our marketplace platforms provide consumers with tools to discover a large selection of original artwork and designs created by a leading global artist community of approximately 300,000 artists across all platforms. Our marketplaces empower artists to reach a global audience of art lovers and design conscious buyers and earn a living pursuing their passion, while we handle various marketing, promotion, and logistics, such as coordination of print-on-demand production, global shipping, and payment processing. In 2016, we expanded our art marketplaces with the acquisition of The Other Art Fair, allowing us to offer buyers the ability to purchase original art from emerging artists around the globe, both online through Saatchi Art’s online gallery and in-person through The Other Art Fair’s events. We believe our marketplaces are distinguished by the high-quality products, caliber of artists and superior customer service that we provide to both artists and buyers. 
 Our art and design marketplaces include:
    
· | Society6. Society6 provides artists with an online commerce platform to feature and sell their original designs on an array of consumer products in the home décor, accessories, and apparel categories. Artists post their designs, set the price for art prints, and select other products within the Society6 product portfolio on which their designs can be sold. After a product is purchased, third party vendors produce, package and ship the product directly to the buyer. As of December 31, 2016, there were approximately 230,000 active artists on Society6, an increase of more than 32% from the prior year. There are now more than 3.6 million unique designs available across the Society6 product portfolio, a 33% increase year-over-year. During 2016, Society6 facilitated sales from customers located in over 100 countries, and approximately 44% of Society6’s users accessed its services via mobile devices.

· | Saatchi Art.

space and style. There are currently more than 650,000 original, unique works, which were created by over 75,000 artists, available on the Saatchi Art platform. In addition, artists can choose to sell prints of the artwork they post on Saatchi Art and we contract with third-party vendors to produce and ship the prints directly to the buyer. Saatchi Art has sold works to buyers located in over 80 countries.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Other Art Fair. The Other Art Fair, a leading art fair for discovering emerging artists, provides a platform for artists to present and sell their work directly to art buyers in an accessible atmosphere designed to allow visitors to enjoy an interactive and immersive experience. Using a selection committee of art experts and a guest curator, each fair showcases approximately 120 artists and their work, enabling both collectors and first-time buyers to buy directly from emerging artists. Since 2011, The Other Art Fair has hosted approximately 15 fairs working with over 1,000 artists from more than 20 countries.

  Media
 We operate diverse media brands that reach audiences through social channels, newsletters and websites. We create a wide variety of content designed to engage our audience on a range of topics across these channels. In some cases, these efforts support the brands of our partners rather than properties we own.    Content Creation and Distribution. We create high-quality, informative and engaging digital content in a wide variety of formats including videos, articles and slideshows. We strive to create content that appeals to our audiences and to our advertisers. We publish a majority of our content on our owned and operated media properties, each of which is focused on a specific topic or interest. Most of the content published on our media properties was previously produced by a large community of freelance professionals, but we now focus our content creation process on building relationships with a smaller number of freelance content creators and influencers who have subject matter expertise and bring increased authority and credibility to their content. 
 Users visit our media properties through search engine referrals, direct navigation, social media referrals, and e-mail and online marketing activities. Our media properties are designed to be easily discoverable by users due to the combination of relevant content, search engine optimization and the ability of users to recommend and share our content via social media websites and applications such as Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram and Twitter. Visitors access our media properties through desktop and mobile platforms, including mobile applications, and can also view our content on third party distribution channels such as Facebook and YouTube.
 Our portfolio of owned and operated media properties includes our largest brands—Livestrong.com and eHow—as well as nearly 20 smaller media properties that are focused on specific topics or interests. Livestrong.com is an online destination for health and healthy living with an extensive library of health, fitness, lifestyle and nutrition articles and videos. This content, combined with interactive tools, mobile applications, user-contributed nutritional information and social media community features, helps users create customized goals and monitor their health, fitness and life achievements, while serving as a platform for community members to connect with each other. eHow is a do-it-yourself reference destination with an extensive library of articles and videos that provide people with practical solutions and easily understandable instruction and advice to solve a variety of problems that they may encounter throughout their day. During the third quarter of 2016, we began launching several category-specific properties leveraging topics and content from eHow because we feel that more narrowly focused media properties with a distinct editorial voice now resonate better with audiences. These category-specific media properties currently include: Cuteness.com, a community for pet owners and animal lovers; Techwalla.com, a site that provides expansive reviews and information on technology products for your home and family; LEAF.tv, a site with rich content in living, eating, and fashion; and Sapling.com, a millennial source for information on personal finance. As we continue this process of migrating categories of content onto new media properties, eHow.com will narrow its focus on informative and entertaining projects for do-it-yourself enthusiasts. Collectively, our owned and operated media properties reached nearly 46 million unique visitors in the United States in December 2016 according to comScore.

 We also use our content creation platform to create original custom content focused on specific topics for third party publishers and brands, which we host and seamlessly integrate onto dedicated sections of these partners’ websites. These arrangements generally include a revenue sharing component with regard to advertising revenue generated by this content. We currently have approximately 25 such hosted properties in our portfolio.
     Monetization. We have developed a multi-faceted monetization platform, incorporating a multitude of advertising partners ranging from sell side platforms to advertising exchanges, that we deploy to our owned and operated media properties and the media properties we host for our partners. We work directly with advertisers to provide them with sponsored content and premium display and native ad inventory, while also streamlining ad planning and buying and managing media campaigns through the use of technology and proprietary first-party data sets.
     For monetization of our display ad inventory, our programmatic platform automates the selling of ad inventory using third party technology and sophisticated data sets. We use a series of algorithms and proprietary methods to present visitors with relevant advertisements that can be dynamically optimized via creative rotation, frequency capping, and data to improve monetization performance and consumer experience. Our system of monetization tools also includes yield optimization systems that continuously evaluate the performance of advertisements on desktop and mobile in order to maximize revenue, while utilizing ad management infrastructures that manage multiple ad formats and control ad inventory.
 Technology 
 Our technologies include software applications built to run on independent clusters of standard and commercially available servers located at co-location facilities in North America. We make substantial use of off-the-shelf available open-source technologies such as Linux, PHP, MySQL, Redis, mongoDB, Memcache, and Lucene in addition to commercial platforms such as Microsoft, including Windows Operating Systems, SQL Server, and .NET. These systems are connected to the Internet via load balancers, firewalls, and routers installed in multiple redundant pairs. We also utilize third party services to geographically deliver data using major content delivery network (“CDN”) providers. Virtualization is heavily deployed throughout our technology architecture, which affords scaling numerous properties in an efficient and cost effective manner. Enterprise class storage systems provide redundancy in order to maintain continued and seamless system availability in the event of most component failures.
 Our business intelligence platform and financial systems are hosted in Tier IV data centers alongside most of our public facing Media websites and applications. Some of our websites are hosted with a third party cloud hosting provider. Each of our significant websites is designed to be fault-tolerant, with collections of application servers, typically configured in a load balanced state, in order to provide additional resiliency. Our environment is equipped with a full-scale monitoring solution, which includes an outsourced network operations center that is continuously staffed.
 International Operations
 We provide our products and services to consumers around the world. Our marketplaces are available to artists and buyers globally and, in 2016, Society6 started working with its first international vendor in Australia to more efficiently ship products to customers in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition, The Other Art Fair is based in London and currently hosts art fairs in the United Kingdom and Australia. Our Media service offering includes eHow en Español and eHow Brasil (Spanish and Portuguese language sites that target both the U.S. and the worldwide Spanish/Portuguese-speaking markets). Information regarding financial data by geographic areas is set forth in Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15, “Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and additional information regarding certain risks associated with our international operations is provided under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Customers
 The products and artwork sold through our Marketplaces service offering are primarily sold directly to consumers. We also sell some products and artwork to trade professionals and commercial customers.

 Our Media customers currently include advertisers and advertising providers that purchase advertising space on our owned and operated media properties, as well as third party brands, publishers and advertisers for whom we create and, in some cases, host content. Our advertising strategy is currently focused on both direct sales channels with brands and advertising agencies, particularly with respect to native and sponsored ad campaigns, and programmatic offerings that utilize various advertising network exchanges to manage our ad stack. A significant portion of the advertising revenue generated by our Media business is derived from our agreements with Google. See “Item 1A.  Risk Factors—We depend upon certain arrangements with Google for a significant portion of our revenue. A termination of, or a loss of revenue generated from, our agreements with Google would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
     Competition
 We operate in highly competitive and developing industries that are characterized by rapid technological change, various business models and frequent disruption of incumbents by innovative entrants.
 Marketplaces. Our art and design marketplaces compete with a wide variety of online and brick-and-mortar companies selling comparable products. Society6 primarily competes with companies that utilize a print-on-demand model whereby consumer products are produced and shipped to customers with selected artist generated designs printed on them, such as RedBubble, Zazzle and Minted, as well as companies that offer broader home décor and apparel products, such as Etsy and Wayfair. Saatchi Art competes with traditional offline art galleries, art consultants and other online properties selling original artwork, such as Artfinder, Artspace, Ugallery, Vango, eBay and Amazon Art. The Other Art Fair competes with various art fairs, and in particular fairs that feature reasonably priced artwork from emerging artists such as The Affordable Art Fair. Our marketplaces must successfully attract, retain and engage both buyers and sellers to use our platforms and attend our fairs. We believe that the principal competitive factors for such marketplaces include the quality, price and uniqueness of the products, artwork or services being offered; the selection of goods and artists featured; the ability to source numerous products efficiently and cost-effectively with respect to our print-on-demand products; customer service; the convenience and ease of the shopping experience we provide; and our reputation and brand strength. We expect competition to continue to intensify as online and offline businesses increasingly compete with each other and the barriers to enter online channels are reduced.
 Media. We face intense competition for our Media service offering from a wide range of competitors. These markets are rapidly evolving, fragmented and competition could increase in the future as more companies enter the space. We compete for advertisers on the basis of a number of factors, including return on marketing expenditures, price of our offerings, and the ability to deliver large audiences or precise types of segmented audiences. Our principal competitors in this space currently include various online media companies ranging from large Internet media companies to specialized and enthusiast properties that focus on particular areas of consumer interest, as well as social media outlets such as Facebook, Snapchat and Pinterest, where brands and advertisers are focusing a significant portion of their online advertising spend in order to connect with their customers. Some of our competitors have larger audiences and more financial resources than we have and many of our competitors are making significant investments in order to compete with various aspects of our business. 
 Many of our current Marketplaces and Media competitors have, and potential competitors may have, substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have; greater technical capabilities; greater brand recognition; longer operating histories; differentiated products and services; and larger customer bases. These resources may help some of our competitors and potential competitors respond more quickly as the industry and technology evolves, focus more on product innovation, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to website and system development than we do. Additional information regarding competition is included under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Intellectual Property
 Our intellectual property consists of trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights and trade secrets, and is, in the aggregate, important to our business. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights in the United States and other jurisdictions, including trademarks, patents, copyrights, and trade secret laws, 

 
  8

 
together with contractual provisions and technical measures that we have implemented. We rely more heavily on trade secret protection than patent protection. To protect our trade secrets, we control access to our proprietary systems and technology, including our platforms and infrastructure. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with third parties that provide products and services to us.
 We have trademarks registered in the United States and in various countries (some of which are registered in multiple classes) for some of our core properties, including “Society6” and “eHow”, and we have additional trademark applications pending in the United States and other jurisdictions. We also have patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other jurisdictions with respect to certain methods, processes and technologies related to our Media service offering that expire between 2027 and 2033, and we have patent applications pending in the United States and other jurisdictions specific to our Media service offering. We believe that the duration of our patents is adequate for the current needs of our business. We generally do not register the copyrights associated with our content with the United States Copyright Office due to the relatively high costs we would incur to register all of our copyrights.
 In addition to the intellectual property we own, we also have licenses to use the “Saatchi” name in connection with our Saatchi Art marketplace and the “Livestrong.com” name in connection with our Livestrong.com media property, in each case, as permitted by the terms of intellectual property or licensing agreements with the third parties who retain the ownership rights to such names. Additional information regarding certain risks related to our intellectual property is included under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Regulation
 We are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, including laws and regulations relating to freedom of expression; information security; data privacy and data collection; pricing and fees; employment related matters; online content and the distribution of content; intellectual property rights, including secondary liability for infringement by others; product liability claims; taxation, including sales and value-added taxes (“VAT”); online advertising and marketing, including email marketing, unsolicited commercial email, native advertising and sponsored content; and the use of social media influencers. 
 In the United States, Congress has adopted legislation that regulates certain aspects of the Internet, including the Communications Decency Act, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Lanham Act, the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, the CAN-SPAM Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act. Advertising and promotional information presented to visitors on our online properties, our related social media channels and through our other marketing activities are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern unfair and deceptive practices. Because we operate large consumer-facing media properties and marketplace platforms, we are also subject to state, federal and foreign laws and regulations governing privacy of users’ search and purchasing habits and other information, including requirements related to the collection and protection of consumers’ non-public personal information, user preferences and similar personal data. We believe that we will also be subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which was enacted in the European Union in May 2016, becomes effective in May 2018 and relates to data protection and privacy.
 We must also comply with certain foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and the economic and trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and the U.S. Commerce Department based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states, organizations and individuals. Additionally, some of the products and services we provide to customers globally may require approval under applicable U.S. export and customs laws. 
 Federal, state, local and foreign governments are also considering other legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate the Internet in more and different ways than exist today, including with respect to taxes. New laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may significantly impact our business. The costs of compliance with the various laws and regulations applicable to us are high and may increase in the future and any failure 

 
  9

 
to comply with applicable laws and regulations may subject us to additional liabilities and penalties. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 265 employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that relations with our employees are good. Seasonality
 Our Marketplaces service offering is affected by traditional retail seasonality and there is generally increased sales activity on our marketplaces platforms during the fourth quarter holiday season. Both our Marketplaces and Media service offerings are also affected by seasonal fluctuations in Internet usage, which generally slows during the summer months. These seasonal trends have caused, and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results. Available Information
 We file reports with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any other filings required by the SEC. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available free of charge in the investor relations section of our corporate website (http://ir.leafgroup.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
