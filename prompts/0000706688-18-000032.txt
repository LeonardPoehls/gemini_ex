ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the "Company," "we," "us," "our" and similar expressions are references to Aaron’s, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
General Development of Business
Established in 1955 and incorporated in 1962 as a Georgia corporation, Aaron's, Inc., is a leading omnichannel provider of lease-purchase solutions. Aaron's engages in the sales and lease ownership and specialty retailing of furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories through its more than 1,700 Company-operated and franchised stores in 47 states and Canada as well as its e-commerce platform, Aarons.com. Our stores carry well-known brands such as Samsung®, Frigidaire®, Hewlett-Packard®, LG®, Whirlpool®, Simmons®, Philips®, Ashley®, and United Furniture Industries. 
On April 14, 2014, the Company acquired a 100% ownership interest in Progressive Finance Holdings, LLC ("Progressive Leasing"), a leading virtual lease-to-own company, providing lease-purchase solutions through approximately 27,000 retail locations in 46 states and the District of Columbia.
On October 15, 2015, Progressive Leasing acquired a 100% ownership interest in Dent-A-Med, Inc., d/b/a the HELPcard® (collectively, "DAMI"), which provides a variety of "second-look" credit products that are originated through federally insured banks. Together with Progressive Leasing, DAMI allows the Company to provide retail and merchant partners one source for financing and leasing transactions with below-prime customers.
On May 13, 2016, the Company sold its 82 Company-operated HomeSmart stores (our weekly pay concept) and ceased operations of that division.
On July 27, 2017, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of the store operations of SEI/Aaron's, Inc. ("SEI"), the Company's largest franchisee. At the time of the acquisition, the SEI store operations served approximately 90,000 customers through 104 Aaron's-branded stores in 11 states primarily in the Northeast. The acquisition is benefiting the Company's omnichannel platform through added scale, strengthening its presence in certain geographic markets, and enhancing Aaron's ability to drive inventory supply-chain synergies between the Aaron's Business and Progressive Leasing in markets that SEI served.
As of December 31, 2017, we had 1,726 Aaron's stores, comprised of 1,175 Company-operated stores in 35 states and Canada, and 551 independently-owned franchised stores in 40 states and Canada. 
We own, or are otherwise entitled to use, the various trademarks, trade names, service marks, and taglines used in our businesses, including those used with the operations of Aaron’s®, Aaron’s Sales & Lease Ownership®, Progressive Leasing, Dent-A-Med, the HELPcard®, and Woodhaven®. We intend to file for additional trade name and trademark protection when appropriate.
Business Environment and Company Outlook
Like many industries, the lease-to-own industry has been transformed by the internet and virtual marketplace. We believe that the Progressive Leasing and DAMI acquisitions have been strategically transformational in this respect by allowing the Company to diversify its presence in the market and strengthen our business, as demonstrated by Progressive Leasing's significant revenue and profit growth in 2017. The Company is also leveraging franchisee acquisition opportunities to expand into new geographic markets and benefit from synergies. We believe the traditional store based lease-to-own industry has been negatively impacted in recent periods by: (i) increased competition from a wide range of competitors, including national, regional and local operators of lease-to-own stores; virtual lease-to-own companies; traditional and e-commerce retailers; and, indirectly, from various types of consumer finance companies that enable our customers to shop at traditional or online retailers; (ii) the challenges faced by many traditional "brick-and-mortar" retailers, with respect to a decrease in the number of consumers visiting those stores, especially younger consumers; (iii) the continuing economic challenges facing many traditional lease-to-own customers; and (iv) commoditization of pricing in electronics. In response to these changing market conditions, we are executing a strategic plan that focuses on the following items and that we believe position us for success over the long-term:

• | Improve Aaron's store profitability – We remain committed to increasing profits through improved marketing and customer acquisition strategies, rapid customer onboarding, improved collections and merchandise loss controls, optimization of product mix, increases in customer retention, cost efficiency initiatives and strategic store consolidations. In addition, our Aaron's Business is investing in improving its analytical capabilities to optimize pricing, promotion, and both product mix and product lifecycle management, which is expected to enhance margins and drive lease volume.

• | Accelerate our omnichannel platform – We believe Aarons.com represents an opportunity to provide more options and shopping convenience in the lease-to-own industry. We are focused on engaging customers in ways that are convenient for them by providing them a seamless, direct-to-door platform through which to shop in store or online across our product offering.


• | Strengthen relationships of Progressive Leasing and DAMI's current retail partners – Our Progressive Leasing and DAMI businesses have benefited from both long-term and relatively newer, mutually beneficial relationships with our existing retailer base. Our ability to maintain these relationships and address the changing needs of these retailers is critical to the long-term growth strategy of our business.


• | Focus on converting existing pipeline into Progressive Leasing retail partners – Our Progressive Leasing business segment is continuously focused on establishing new relationships with retailers and identifying solutions that address their business needs. We believe these new relationships are fundamental to continued revenue growth for Progressive Leasing.


• | Champion compliance – Aaron's, Inc. is a large and diverse company with thousands of daily transactions that are extensively regulated and subject to the requirements of various federal, state, and local laws and regulations. We continue to believe and set expectations that long-term success requires all associates to behave in an ethical manner and to comply with all laws and regulations governing our company's behavior.

Operating Segments
As of December 31, 2017, the Company has three operating and reportable segments: Progressive Leasing, Aaron's Business and DAMI. During 2017, the Company changed its composition of reportable segments by combining the Sales and Lease Ownership, Franchise and Woodhaven components into one reportable segment, the Aaron's Business, to align the reportable segments with the current organizational structure and the operating results that the chief operating decision maker regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company has retroactively adjusted, for all periods presented, its segment disclosures to align with the current composition of reportable segments.
The results of Progressive Leasing and DAMI have been included in the Company's consolidated results and presented as operating segments from their April 14, 2014 and October 15, 2015 acquisition dates, respectively. On May 13, 2016, the Company sold its HomeSmart operating segment, which included 82 stores.
The operating results of our three reportable segments may be found in (i) Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and (ii) Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
Progressive Leasing 
Established in 1999 and acquired by the Company in 2014, Progressive Leasing is a leader in the expanding virtual lease-to-own market. Progressive Leasing partners with retailers, primarily in the furniture and bedding, automobile electronics and accessories, mobile, jewelry, consumer electronics and appliance industries to offer a lease-purchase option for credit-challenged customers who may not have access to traditional credit-based financing options. 
We offer a proprietary, technology-based application and approval process that does not require Progressive Leasing employees to be staffed in a store. Once a customer is approved, Progressive Leasing purchases the merchandise from the retailer and enters into a lease-to-own agreement with the customer. The contract provides early-buyout options or ownership after a contractually specified amount has been paid. Progressive Leasing has retail partners in 46 states and the District of Columbia, and operates under state-and-District specific regulations.
Aaron's Business
Aaron's store-based and e-commerce operations
Our omnichannel platform allows us to engage customers in ways that are convenient for them by providing them a seamless, direct-to-door platform through which to shop in an Aaron's store or through our e-commerce platform across our product offering. Aaron's store-based and e-commerce operations employ monthly, semi-monthly and weekly payment models to provide durable household goods to consumers through our Aaron's stores and at Aarons.com. Its customer base is comprised primarily of customers with limited access to traditional credit sources such as bank financing, installment credit or credit cards. Customers of our Aaron's Business segment take advantage of our services to acquire consumer goods they might not otherwise be able to without incurring additional debt or long-term obligations.

We have developed a distinctive concept for our stores including specific merchandising, store layout, pricing and agreement terms all designed to appeal to our target consumer market. The typical store layout is a combination showroom and warehouse generally comprising 6,000 to 10,000 square feet, with an average of approximately 8,000 square feet. Each store usually maintains at least two trucks for delivery, service and return of product. We generally offer same or next day delivery for addresses located within approximately ten miles of the store. Our stores provide a broad selection of brand name electronics, computers, appliances, bedding and furniture, including bedding and furniture manufactured by our Woodhaven Furniture Industries division.
Approximately 96% of our store lease agreements have monthly payment terms and most of the remaining 4% are semi-monthly. By comparison, weekly agreements are the industry standard. Additionally, our proprietary management information system links each Company-operated store to our corporate headquarters.
We may re-lease or sell merchandise that customers return to us prior to the expiration of their agreements. We may also offer up-front purchase options at prices we believe are competitive. 
Franchise
We franchise our Aaron's stores in markets where we have no immediate plans to enter. Our franchise program adds value to our Company by allowing us to (i) recognize additional revenues from franchise fees and royalties; (ii) lower our average costs of purchasing, manufacturing and advertising through economies of scale; and (iii) increase customer recognition of our brand.
We enter into agreements with our franchisees to govern the opening and operations of franchised stores. Under our standard agreement, we receive a franchise fee from $15,000 to $50,000 per store depending upon market size. Our standard agreement is for a term of ten years, with one ten-year renewal option. Franchisees are also obligated to remit to us royalty payments of 6% of the weekly collections from their stores. Most franchisees are involved in the day-to-day operations of their stores.
Qualifying franchisees may take part in a financing arrangement we have established with several financial institutions to assist the franchisee in establishing and operating their store(s). Although an inventory financing plan is the primary component of the financing program, we have also arranged, in certain circumstances, for the franchisee to receive a revolving credit line, allowing them to expand operations. We provide guarantees for amounts outstanding under this franchise financing program.
All franchisees are required to complete a comprehensive training program and to operate their franchised sales and lease ownership stores in compliance with our policies, standards and specifications. Annually, each franchise is required to represent and warrant its compliance with all applicable federal, state and/or local laws, regulations and ordinances with respect to its business operations. Although franchisees are not generally required to purchase their lease merchandise from our fulfillment centers, many do so in order to take advantage of Company-sponsored financing, bulk purchasing discounts and favorable delivery terms.
Manufacturing
Woodhaven Furniture Industries, our manufacturing segment, was established by the Company in 1982. Integrated manufacturing enables us to control critical features such as the quality, cost, delivery, styling, durability and quantity of our furniture products, and we believe this provides an integration advantage over our competitors. Substantially all produced items continue to be leased or sold through Aaron's stores, including franchised stores. However, we also manufacture and sale furniture products to other retailers. 
Our Woodhaven Furniture Industries division produces upholstered living-room furniture (including contemporary sofas, chairs and modular sofa and ottoman collections in a variety of natural and synthetic fabrics) and bedding (including standard sizes of mattresses and box springs). The furniture designed and produced by this division incorporates features that we believe result in reduced production costs, enhanced durability and improved shipping processes all relative to furniture we would otherwise purchase from third parties. These features include (i) standardized components, (ii) reduced number of parts and features susceptible to wear or damage, (iii) more resilient foam, (iv) durable fabrics and sturdy frames which translate to longer life and higher residual value and (v) devices that allow sofas to stand on end for easier and more efficient transport. The division also provides replacement covers for all styles and fabrics of its upholstered furniture, as well as other parts, for use in reconditioning leased furniture that has been returned.
Woodhaven Furniture Industries consists of five furniture manufacturing plants and seven bedding manufacturing facilities totaling approximately 819,000 square feet of manufacturing capacity.

DAMI
Founded in 1983 and acquired by the Company in 2015, DAMI primarily serves customers that may not qualify for traditional prime lending who desire to purchase goods and services from participating merchants. DAMI, which operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Progressive Leasing, offers customized programs, with services that include revolving loans, private label cards and access to a unique processing platform. DAMI's current network of merchants includes medical and dental markets, furniture, mattresses, fitness equipment, and jewelry. The Company believes the DAMI product offerings are complementary to those of Progressive Leasing and is expanding into the markets and merchants that DAMI serves. 
We extend or decline credit to an applicant through third party bank partners based upon the customer's credit rating. Our bank partners originate the loan by providing financing to the merchant at the point of sale and acquiring the receivable at a discount from the face value, which represents a pre-negotiated fee between DAMI and the merchant. DAMI then acquires the receivable from the bank. 
Qualifying customers receive a credit card to finance their initial purchase and to use in subsequent purchases at the merchant or other participating merchants for an initial two year period, which we will renew if the cardholder remains in good standing. The customer is required to make periodic minimum payments and may pay certain annual and other periodic fees. 
Operations
Operating Strategy
Our operating strategy is based on distinguishing our brands from those of our competitors along with maximizing our operational efficiencies. Our Progressive Leasing and DAMI operating strategies are based on providing excellent service to our merchant partners and our customers, along with continued development of technology-based solutions. This allows us to increase our merchant partners' sales, drive demand for our service, and scale in an efficient manner. Specifically with Progressive Leasing, we believe our ability to service a retailer with limited labor costs allows us to maintain a cost of ownership for leased merchandise lower than that of other options available to our customers.
We implement this strategy for our Aaron's store-based and e-commerce operations by (i) emphasizing the uniqueness of our sales and lease ownership concept from those in our industry generally; (ii) offering high levels of customer service; (iii) promoting our vendors' and Aaron's brand names; (iv) managing merchandise through our manufacturing and distribution capabilities; and (v) utilizing proprietary management information systems. 
We believe that the success of our store-based and e-commerce operations is attributable to our distinctive approach to the business that distinguishes us from both our lease-to-own and credit retail competitors. We have pioneered innovative approaches to meeting changing customer needs that we believe differ from many of our competitors. These include (i) offering lease ownership agreements that result in a lower cost to own; (ii) maintaining larger and more attractive store showrooms; (iii) offering a wider selection of higher-quality merchandise; (iv) providing an up-front cash and carry purchase option on select merchandise at competitive prices; and (v) establishing an online platform that provides access to our product offerings. 
Aaron's Store-Based Operations
The Aaron's store-based operations has one President, one Chief Operations Officer, five Senior Vice Presidents and one Divisional Vice President that provide executive leadership to their respective operations. Each operation is subdivided into geographic groupings overseen by a total of 25 Regional Directors, including one Canadian Regional Director and 141 Regional Managers, including three Canadian Regional Managers. 
At the individual store level, the store manager is primarily responsible for managing and supervising all aspects of store operations, including (i) customer relations and account management, (ii) deliveries and pickups, (iii) warehouse and inventory management, (iv) partial merchandise selection, (v) employment decisions, including hiring, training and terminating store employees and (vi) certain marketing initiatives. Store managers also administer the processing of lease return merchandise including making determinations with respect to inspection, repairs, sales, reconditioning and subsequent leasing. 
Our business philosophy emphasizes safeguarding of Company assets, strict cost containment and financial controls. All personnel are expected to monitor expenses to contain costs. We pay all material invoices from Company headquarters in order to enhance financial accountability. We believe that careful monitoring of lease merchandise as well as operational expenses enables us to maintain financial stability and profitability.
We use management information systems to facilitate customer orders, collections, merchandise returns and inventory monitoring. Through the use of proprietary software, each of our stores is network linked directly to corporate headquarters enabling us to monitor single store performance on a daily basis. This network system assists the store manager in (i) tracking merchandise on the showroom floor and warehouse, (ii) minimizing delivery times, (iii) assisting with product purchasing and (iv) matching customer needs with available inventory.

Lease Agreement Approval, Renewal and Collection 
Our Progressive Leasing business uses a proprietary decisioning algorithm to determine which customers would meet our leasing qualifications. The transaction is completed online or through a point of sale integration with our retail partners. Contractual payments are usually based on a customer's pay frequency and are typically processed through automated clearing house payments. Progressive Leasing agreements for merchandise require payments in arrears. If the payment is unsuccessful, collections are managed in-house through our call center, customer service hubs and proprietary lease management system. The call center contacts customers within a few days after the due date to encourage them to keep their agreement current. If the customer chooses to return the merchandise, arrangements are made to receive the merchandise from the customer, either through our retail partners, our Draper, Utah location, our customer service hubs or our Aaron's operated stores.
One of the factors in the success of our store-based operations is timely collections, which are monitored by store managers. Customers are contacted within a few days after their lease payment due dates to encourage them to keep their agreement current. Careful attention to collections is particularly important in sales and lease ownership operations, where the customer typically has the option to cancel the agreement at any time and each contractually due payment is generally considered a renewal of the agreement. The Company continues to encourage customers to take advantage of the convenience of enrolling in the Company's automatic payment program, EZ Pay. 
We have a proprietary lease approval process with respect to store customers, which includes obtaining customer data from third party service providers, verifying employment or other reliable sources of income and using personal references supplied by the customer. Generally our Aaron's store operations and e-commerce agreements for merchandise require payments in advance and the merchandise normally is recovered if a payment is significantly in arrears. We currently do not extend credit to our customers at our stores.
The provision for lease merchandise write-offs as a percentage of consolidated lease revenues was 4.8%, 4.8% and 5.1% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We believe that our collection and recovery policies comply with applicable laws, and we discipline any employee we determine to have deviated from such policies.
Credit Agreement Approval and Collection
DAMI partners with merchants to provide a variety of revolving credit products originated through two third-party federally insured banks to customers that may not qualify for traditional prime lending (called "second-look" financing programs). We believe DAMI provides the following strategic benefits when combined with Progressive Leasing's product offerings:

• | Enhanced product for retail partners - DAMI enhances Progressive Leasing's best-in-class point-of-sale product with an integrated solution for below-prime customers. DAMI has a centralized, scalable underwriting model with a long operating history, deployed through its established bank partners, and a receivable management system.


• | Higher consumer credit quality - DAMI primarily serves customers with FICO scores between 600 and 700, which make up approximately a quarter of the U.S. population. These customers generally have greater purchasing power with stronger credit profiles than Progressive Leasing's current customers.


• | Expanded customer base - In addition to complementing Progressive Leasing's traditional offering for existing and prospective retail partners, DAMI's strong relationships with merchant partners who provide services offer an additional channel for longer-term growth.

DAMI uses an underwriting model that provides standardized credit decisions, including borrowing limit amounts. Credit decisions are primarily based on the customer's credit rating and ability-to-pay ratio. Loans receivable are unsecured, and collections on loans receivable are managed in-house through DAMI's call center and proprietary loans receivable management system. 
Customer Service
A critical component of the success in our operations is our commitment to developing good relationships with our customers. The Company consistently monitors consumer interests and trends to ensure that our business model is aligned with our customer's needs. The Company believes that building a relationship with the customer that ensures customer satisfaction is critical because customers of Progressive Leasing and Aaron's store-based and e-commerce operations have the option of returning the leased merchandise at any time. Our goal, therefore, is to develop positive associations about the Company and our products, service, and support in the minds of our customers from the moment they enter our showrooms and the showrooms of our retail partners. We demonstrate our commitment to superior customer service by providing customers with access to product through multiple channels, including Progressive Leasing's and DAMI's network of retail partner locations, Aarons.com, and Aaron's store-based operations. Aaron's store-based operations provide rapid delivery of leased merchandise (often on same or next day delivery) and investments in technology that improve the customer experience. 
Our Progressive Leasing business offers centralized customer and retailer support through contact centers located in Draper, Utah and Glendale, Arizona.

We believe our strong focus on customer satisfaction at Progressive Leasing and DAMI generates repeat business and long-lasting relationships with our retail and merchant partners. Aaron's store-based and e-commerce operations customers receive multiple complimentary service benefits. These benefits vary according to applicable state law but generally include a same-as-cash option, merchandise repair service, lifetime reinstatement and other discounts and benefits. In order to increase leasing at existing stores, we foster relationships with existing customers to attract recurring business, and many new agreements are attributable to repeat customers.
During 2015, the Company announced the launch of Approve.Me, which is a proprietary platform that provides a single interface for all Progressive Leasing and DAMI customers seeking credit approval or lease options, from prime to second-look financing, or to Progressive Leasing's lease offering. Approve.Me is compatible with most primary or secondary providers and is designed to give retailers a faster and more efficient way to service customers seeking to finance transactions or secure a lease option.
During 2017, Aaron's store-based operations began offering customers the option to obtain a membership in the Aaron's Club Program (the "Club Program"). The benefits to customers of the Club Program are separated into three general categories: (i) health & wellness discounts; (ii) dining, shopping and consumer savings; and (iii) product protection benefits. The product protection benefits provide Club Program members with lease payment waivers for up to four months or a maximum of $1,000 on active customer lease agreements in the event of customer unemployment or illness; replacement of the product in the event the product is stolen or damaged by an act of God; waiver of remaining lease payments on lease agreements in the event of death of any member named on the lease agreement; and/or repair of the product for an extended period after the customer takes ownership. 
Our emphasis on customer service at the Aaron's store-based operations requires that we develop skilled, effective employees who value our customers and who possess and project a genuine desire to serve our customers' needs. To meet this requirement, we have created and implemented a very comprehensive associate development program. The associate development program focuses on and meets the needs of both new and tenured associates. 
Our associate development program is designed to train our associates to provide a uniform and enhanced customer service experience. The primary focus of the associate development program is to equip all associates with the knowledge and skills needed to build strong relationships with our customers and to service customers in a manner that complies with applicable laws, regulations and Company policies. Our learning and development coaches provide live, interactive instruction via webinars. In addition, associates are provided training through an Intranet-based learning management system that can be accessed at any time. Additionally, Aaron’s has a management development program that offers development for current and future store managers and a leadership development program for our multi-unit managers. Also, we produce and post video-based communications regarding important Company initiatives on our intranet site.

For our Aaron's store-based operations, our merchandise product mix is determined by executive leadership and our merchandising department based on an analysis of customer demands. The following table shows the percentage of our Aaron's Business revenues attributable to different merchandise categories: 
 | Year Ended December 31,
Aaron's Business Merchandise Category | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
Furniture | 45 | % | | 42 | % | 42 | %
Electronics | 24 | % | | 26 | % | 25 | %
Appliances | 24 | % | | 24 | % | 24 | %
Computers | 5 | % | | 6 | % | 7 | %
Other | 2 | % | | 2 | % | 2 | %

One of Aaron's Business largest suppliers is our own Woodhaven Furniture Industries, which supplies the majority of the upholstered furniture and bedding we lease or sell through our Aaron's Business segment. We purchase the remaining merchandise directly from manufacturers and local distributors and are generally able to obtain bulk discounts that provide us with cost advantages. To a lesser extent, we also may sell or re-lease certain merchandise returned by our Progressive Leasing customers. We have no long-term agreements for the purchase of merchandise.
The following table shows the percentage of DAMI's revenues attributable to different merchant partner categories:
 | Year Ended December 31,
DAMI Merchant Partner Category | 2017 | | 2016
Medical | 49 | % | | 48 | %
Retail | 20 | % | | 20 | %
Furniture | 23 | % | | 22 | %
Other | 8 | % | | 10 | %

Distribution for Aaron's Store-based Operations
The Aaron's store-based operations utilize our 16 fulfillment centers to control merchandise. These centers average approximately 124,000 square feet, giving us approximately 2.0 million square feet of logistical capacity. 
We believe that our network of fulfillment centers provides us with a strategic advantage over our competitors. Our distribution system allows us to deliver merchandise promptly to our stores in order to quickly meet customer demand and effectively manage inventory levels. Most of our continental U.S. stores are within a 250-mile radius of a fulfillment center, facilitating timely shipment of products to the stores and fast delivery of orders to customers. 
We realize freight savings from bulk discounts and more efficient distribution of merchandise by using fulfillment centers. We use our own tractor-trailers, local delivery trucks and various contract carriers to make weekly deliveries to individual stores.
Marketing and Advertising
Progressive Leasing and DAMI execute their marketing strategy in partnership with retailers and other merchants. This is typically accomplished through in-store signage and marketing material, direct marketing activities, and the education of sales associates.
Our marketing for store-based and e-commerce operations targets both current Aaron's customers and potential customers. We feature brand name products available through our no-credit-needed lease ownership plans. We reach our customer demographics by utilizing national and local television and radio with a combination of brand/image messaging and product/price promotions. In addition, we have enhanced our broadcast presence with digital marketing and via social environments such as Facebook, Instagram, Google+, YouTube and Twitter.
We target new and current customers each month by distributing over 27 million, two-page circulars to homes in the United States and Canada. The circulars advertise brand name merchandise along with the features, options, and benefits of Aaron's no-credit-needed lease ownership plans. We also distribute millions of email and direct mail promotions on an annual basis and monitor store layout plans to ensure that we are optimally attracting customers.
Aaron's, Inc. sponsors events at various levels along with select professional and collegiate teams. All of the Company's sports partnerships are supported with advertising, promotional, marketing and brand activation initiatives that we believe significantly enhance the Company's brand awareness and customer loyalty.

Competition
Aaron's competes with national, regional and local operators of lease-to-own stores, virtual lease-to-own companies, traditional and e-commerce retailers (including many that offer layaway programs) and, indirectly, various types of consumer finance companies that may enable our customers to shop at traditional or on-line retailers, as well as with rental stores that do not offer their customers a purchase option. We also compete with retail stores for customers desiring to purchase merchandise for cash or on credit. Competition is based primarily on product selection and availability, customer service and lease rates, store location and terms. Our largest competitor for Aaron's store-based and e-commerce operations is Rent-A-Center. 
Working Capital
The Aaron's Business and Progressive Leasing sales and lease ownership model results in the Company remaining the owner of merchandise on lease; therefore, the Company's most significant working capital asset is merchandise inventory on lease. The Aaron's Business store-based and e-commerce operations also require the Company to maintain significant levels of merchandise inventory available for lease in order to provide the service demanded by our customers and to ensure timely delivery of our products. Consistent and dependable sources of liquidity are required to maintain such merchandise levels. Failure to maintain appropriate levels of merchandise could materially adversely affect our customer relationships and our business. We believe our cash on hand, operating cash flows, credit availability under our financing agreements and other sources of financing are adequate to meet our normal liquidity requirements. 
Raw Materials
The principal raw materials we use in furniture manufacturing at Woodhaven are fabric, foam, fiber, wire-innerspring assemblies, plywood, oriented strand board and hardwood. All of these materials are purchased in the open market from unaffiliated sources. We are not dependent on any single supplier. None of the raw materials we use are in short supply.
Seasonality
Our revenue mix is moderately seasonal for both our Aaron's Business and Progressive Leasing segments. Adjusting for growth, the first quarter of each year generally has higher revenues than any other quarter. This is primarily due to realizing the full benefit of business that historically gradually increases in the fourth quarter as a result of the holiday season, as well as the receipt by our customers in the first quarter of federal and state income tax refunds. Our customers will more frequently exercise the early purchase option on their existing lease agreements or purchase merchandise off the showroom floor during the first quarter of the year. We expect these trends to continue in future periods. 
Industry Overview
The Lease-to-Own Industry
The lease-to-own industry offers customers an alternative to traditional methods of obtaining home furnishings, electronics, appliances, computers and other durable consumer goods. In a standard industry lease-to-own transaction, the customer has the option to acquire ownership of merchandise over a fixed term, usually 12 to 24 months, normally by making weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly lease payments. The customer may cancel the agreement at any time by returning the merchandise to the lessor. If the customer leases the item through the completion of the full term, he or she then obtains ownership of the item. The customer may also purchase the item at any time by tendering the contractually specified payment.
The lease-to-own model is particularly attractive to customers who are unable to pay the full upfront purchase price for merchandise or who lack the credit to qualify for conventional financing programs. Other individuals who find the lease-to-own model attractive are customers who, despite access to credit, do not wish to incur additional debt, have only a temporary need for the merchandise or desire to field test a particular brand or model before purchasing it.
Aaron's, Inc. versus Traditional Lease-to-Own
We blend elements of lease-to-own and traditional retailing by providing customers with the option to either lease merchandise with the opportunity to obtain ownership or to purchase merchandise outright. We believe our sales and lease ownership program is a more effective method of retailing our merchandise to customers than a typical lease-to-own business or the traditional method of credit installment sales. 
Our model is distinctive from the conventional lease-to-own model in that we encourage our customers to obtain ownership of their leased merchandise. Based upon our own data and industry data, our customers obtain ownership more often (between 50% - 60%) than in the lease-to-own businesses in general (approximately 25%).
11

We believe our sales and lease ownership model offers the following distinguishing characteristics when compared to traditional lease-to-own stores:

• | Lower total cost - Our agreement terms generally provide a lower cost of ownership to the customer.


• | Wider merchandise selection - Our Progressive Leasing and DAMI operations allow us to offer a wider selection of merchandise via partnerships with various merchants. Additionally, we also generally offer a larger selection of higher-quality merchandise through our Aaron's e-commerce and store-based operations than others in the lease to own industry.


• | Larger store layout - Aaron's stores average 8,000 square feet, which is significantly larger than the average size of our largest competitor's lease-to-own stores.


• | Fewer payments - Our typical plan offers semi-monthly or monthly payments versus the industry standard of weekly payments.


• | Flexible payment methods - We offer our customers the opportunity to pay by cash, check, ACH, debit card or credit card. We also offer an EZ Pay option which gives customers the ease of using their debit or credit card to set up an automatic payment on the date they select. Our Aaron's stores currently receive approximately 68% of their payment volume (in dollars) from customers by check, debit card or credit card.

We believe our sales and lease ownership model also compares well against traditional retailers in areas such as merchandise selection and the latest product offerings. As technology advances and home furnishings and appliances evolve, we expect to continue offering our customers the latest product at affordable prices.
Unlike transactions with traditional retailers, in which the customer is committed to purchasing the merchandise, our sales and lease ownership transactions are not credit installment contracts. Therefore, the customer may elect to terminate the transaction after a short, initial lease period. Progressive Leasing provides a 90-day buy-out option on lease-purchase solutions offered through traditional retailers. Our store and e-commerce based operations offer an up-front "cash and carry" purchase option and generally a same-as-cash option on most merchandise at prices that we believe are competitive with traditional retailers. 
Government Regulation
Our operations are extensively regulated by and subject to the requirements of various federal, state and local laws and regulations, and are subject to oversight by various government agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), for example, which may exercise oversight of the advertising and other business practices of our Company. In general, such laws regulate applications for leases, pricing, late charges and other fees, lease disclosures, the content of advertising materials, and certain collection procedures. Violations of certain provisions of these laws may result in material penalties. We are unable to predict the nature or effect on our operations or earnings of unknown future legislation, regulations and judicial decisions or future interpretations of existing and future legislation or regulations relating to our operations, and there can be no assurance that future laws, decisions or interpretations will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or earnings.
A summary of certain laws under which we operate follows. This summary does not purport to be a complete summary of the laws referred to below or of all the laws regulating our operations.
Currently, nearly every state and most provinces in Canada specifically regulate lease-to-own transactions via state or provincial statutes. This includes states in which our Progressive Leasing business has retail partners and also includes states in which we currently operate our Aaron's Business. Most state lease purchase laws require lease-to-own companies to disclose to their customers the total number of payments, total amount and timing of all payments to acquire ownership of any item, any other charges that may be imposed and miscellaneous other items. The more restrictive state lease purchase laws limit the total amount that a customer may be charged for an item, or regulate the "cost-of-rental" amount that lease-to-own companies may charge on lease-to-own transactions, generally defining "cost-of-rental" as lease fees paid in excess of the "retail" price of the goods. Our long-established policy in all states is to disclose the terms of our lease purchase transactions as a matter of good business ethics and customer service. We believe we are in material compliance with the various state lease purchase laws. At the present time, no federal law specifically regulates the lease-to-own transaction. Federal legislation to regulate the transaction has been proposed from time to time. In addition, certain elements of the business including matters such as collections activity, customer contact and credit reporting may be subject to federal laws and regulation.

There has been increased legislative and regulatory attention in the United States, at both the federal and state levels, on financial services products offered to near-prime and subprime consumers in general, which may result in an increase in legislative regulatory efforts directed at the lease-to-own industry. We cannot predict whether any such legislation or regulations will be enacted and what the impact would be on us. From time to time, certain state attorneys general or federal regulatory agencies, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), have directed investigations or regulatory initiatives toward our industry, or toward certain companies within the industry. We cannot predict whether any state attorneys general or federal regulatory agencies, including the CFPB, will direct other investigations or regulatory initiatives towards us or our industry in the future, or what the impact of any such future regulatory initiatives may be. 
Our sales and lease ownership franchise program is subject to FTC oversight and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Several state laws also regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC requires us to furnish to prospective franchisees a Franchise Disclosure Document ("FDD") containing prescribed information. A number of states in which we might consider franchising also regulate the sale of franchises and require registration of the franchise disclosure document with state authorities. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable franchise laws in those states in which we do business and with similar laws in Canada.
DAMI is subject to various federal and state laws that address lending regulations, consumer information, consumer rights, and certain credit card specific requirements, among other things. In addition, DAMI services credit cards issued through third party bank partners and therefore is subject to those banks' Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulators. Several regulations affecting DAMI have been updated in recent years through The Credit Card Act and The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act). Additional regulations are being developed, as the attention placed on the True Lender Doctrine and consumer debt transactions has grown significantly. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Although we are unable to predict the results of any regulatory initiatives, we do not believe that existing and currently proposed regulations will have a material adverse impact on our Progressive Leasing, Aaron's Business and/or DAMI businesses or other operations.
Supply Chain Diligence and Transparency
Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act was adopted to further the humanitarian goal of ending the violent conflict and human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries ("DRC"). This conflict has been partially financed by the exploitation and trade of tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold, often referred to as conflict minerals, which originate from mines or smelters in the region. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act require reporting companies to disclose annually, among other things, whether any such minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products they manufactured during the prior calendar year originated in the DRC and, if so, whether the related revenues were used to support the conflict and/or abuses. 
Some of the products manufactured by Woodhaven Furniture Industries, our manufacturing division, may contain tantalum, tin, tungsten and/or gold. Consequently, in compliance with SEC rules, we have adopted a policy on conflict minerals, which can be found on our website at investor.aarons.com. We have also implemented a supply chain due diligence and risk mitigation process with reference to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or the OECD, guidance approved by the SEC to assess and report annually whether our products are conflict free.
We expect our suppliers to comply with the OECD guidance and industry standards and to ensure that their supply chains conform to our policy and the OECD guidance. We plan to mitigate identified risks by working with our suppliers and may alter our sources of supply or modify our product design if circumstances require.
Employees
At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately 11,900 employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relations with employees are good.
