Item 1. Business.
Our Company
Education Realty Trust, Inc. ("EdR") is a self-managed and self-advised company incorporated in the state of Maryland in July 2004 to develop, acquire, own and manage collegiate housing communities located near university campuses. We were formed to continue and expand upon the collegiate housing business of Allen & O’Hara, Inc., a company with over 40 years of experience as an owner, manager and developer of collegiate housing. We selectively develop collegiate housing communities for our own account and also provide third-party management services as well as third-party development consulting services on collegiate housing development projects for universities and other third parties. As of December 31, 2016, we owned 64 collegiate housing communities located in 22 states containing 32,729 beds in 12,294 apartment units on or near 38 university campuses. As of December 31, 2016, we provided third-party management services for 22 collegiate housing communities located in 11 states containing 11,767 beds in 4,214 apartment units on or near 17 university campuses.
EdR has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes. All of our assets are held by, and we conduct substantially all of our activities through, Education Realty Operating Partnership, LP ("EROP" and collectively with its consolidated subsidiaries, the "Operating Partnership") and its consolidated subsidiaries, EDR Management Inc. (our "Management Company") and EDR Development LLC (our "Development Company"). The majority of our operating expenses are borne by the Operating Partnership or our communities, as the case may be.
Education Realty OP GP, Inc. (the "OP GP"), an entity that is indirectly wholly-owned by EdR, is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. As a result, the Board of Directors of EdR (the "Board") effectively directs all of the Operating Partnership’s affairs. EdR indirectly owns approximately 99.8% of the outstanding partnership units (the "OP Units") of EROP and approximately 0.2% of the OP Units are held by the former owners of our initial properties and assets, including current and former members of our management team and former members of the Board.

One of our consolidated subsidiaries, University Towers Operating Partnership, LP (the "University Towers Partnership"), holds, owns and operates our University Towers property located in Raleigh, North Carolina. We own 72.7% of the partnership units in the University Towers Partnership, and the remaining 27.3% of the partnership units in the University Towers Partnership are held by the former owners of our initial properties and assets, including a former member of the Board.
2016 Highlights
Financing Transactions
During 2016, we prepaid the following indebtedness in full:

• | two remaining ten-year notes under the Master Secured Credit Facility (as defined below):


◦ | a $21.3 million note set to mature on January 1, 2020 with a fixed interest rate of 5.67%; and


◦ | a $54.5 million note set to mature on January 1, 2019 with a fixed interest rate of 6.02%.


• | fixed-rate mortgage debt with an outstanding principal balance of $22.3 million that was assumed in connection with the 2012 acquisition of The Centre at Overton Park. The interest rate was equal to 5.60% and the mortgage debt was scheduled to mature on January 1, 2017.


• | variable rate construction debt with an outstanding principal balance of $35.7 million related to the development of The Retreat at Louisville. The effective interest rate on the repayment date was 2.5% and the loan was scheduled to mature on August 1, 2017.


• | variable rate construction debt with an outstanding principal balance of $49.3 million related to the development of The Retreat at Blacksburg. The effective interest rate on the repayment date was 2.58% and the loan was scheduled to mature on February 4, 2019.

In connection with the prepayments, we incurred penalties of $10.3 million.
We completed a follow-on offering of EdR common stock in January 2016, raising approximately $215.1 million in net proceeds, which were used to repay debt, fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.

We raised $389.7 million of proceeds through our at-the-market equity offering programs (the "ATM Program") and $20.0 million pursuant to the direct stock purchase component of the Amended and Restated Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan.
The sales agents under our ATM Program, acting as forward sellers pursuant to forward sales agreements (the “Forward Agreements”), sold an aggregate of 6.8 million shares of EdR common stock at a weighted average initial forward price of $42.77. The shares sold under the Forward Agreements may be settled at any time on or before December 29, 2017, at which time we expect to issue shares of EdR common stock to the counterparties to the Forward Agreements and receive proceeds from the sales. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – ATM Program.”

Total | | | 1,728 | 792 | $ | 96,550

In August 2016, we delivered four new communities, on-time and on-budget in the aggregate, for total costs of $158.4 million. These include two communities at the University of Kentucky, one community at Virginia Tech and one community at the University of Mississippi. 
We currently have thirteen active development projects that we are developing for our ownership, for which the aggregate development costs are $948.8 million. As of December 31, 2016, $233.2 million of the anticipated costs had been incurred and funded. 
Distributions
During 2016, we declared aggregate quarterly distributions of $1.50 per share of EdR's common stock. At the same time, the Operating Partnership paid an equivalent amount per partnership unit to holders of OP Units.

REIT Status and Taxable REIT Subsidiaries
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. With the exception of income from our taxable REIT subsidiaries (a "TRS" or collectively, the "TRSs"), income earned by the REIT is generally not subject to income taxes. In order to qualify as a REIT, a specified percentage of our gross income generally must be derived from real property sources, which would exclude our income from providing development and management services to third parties as well as our income from certain services afforded to our residents. In order to avoid realizing such income in a manner that would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT, we provide some services through our Management Company and our Development Company, with our Management Company being treated as a TRS. Our Management Company is wholly-owned and controlled by the Operating Partnership, and our Management Company wholly owns our Development Company. Our Development Company is a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes and all assets owned and income earned by our Development Company are deemed to be owned and earned by our Management Company.
Business and Growth Strategy
Our primary business objective is to achieve sustainable long-term growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize long-term stockholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by (i) acquiring collegiate housing communities nationwide that meet our focused investment criteria, (ii) selectively developing properties for our own account, (iii) building our third-party business of management services and development consulting services and (iv) maximizing net operating income from our owned properties through proactive and goal-oriented property management strategies.
Our business has three reportable segments that are identified by their distinct customer base and services provided: collegiate housing leasing, development consulting services and management services. For a discussion of revenues, profit and loss and total assets by segment see “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 13, “Segments” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Acquisition and Development Strategy
Acquisitions
We seek to acquire high-quality, well-located communities with modern floor plans and amenities. Our ideal acquisition targets generally are located in markets that have stable or increasing collegiate populations and high barriers to entry. We also seek to acquire investments in collegiate housing communities that possess sound market fundamentals but are under-performing and would benefit from re-positioning, renovation and/or improved property management. We consider the following property and market factors to identify potential property acquisitions:

• | university and campus reputation;


• | competitive admissions criteria;


• | limited number of on-campus beds and limited plans for expansion;


• | significant out-of-state enrollment;


• | distance of property from campus;


• | property unit mix;


• | competition;


• | past operating performance;


• | potential for improved management;


• | ownership and capital structure;


• | presence of desired amenities;


• | maintenance and condition of the property;


• | access to a university-sponsored or public transportation line depending on location; and


• | parking availability.

Conversely, subject to appropriate market conditions, we may dispose of certain collegiate housing communities. We continually assess all of our communities, the markets in which they are located and the colleges and universities they serve, to determine if any dispositions are necessary or appropriate.

Developments
We develop collegiate housing communities for our ownership. The On-Campus Equity Plan (the "ONE PlanSM") is our private equity program, which allows universities to use our equity and financial stability to develop and revitalize campus housing while preserving their credit capacity for other campus projects. The ONE PlanSM offers one service provider and one equity source to universities seeking to modernize on-campus housing to meet the needs of today’s students. We have completed the following ONE PlanSM developments, which are owned and managed pursuant to long-term ground leases:

• | University Village on Colvin serving Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York;


• | Campus West also serving Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York;


• | GrandMarc at Westberry Place serving Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas; and


• | 2400 Nueces serving the University of Texas at Austin in Austin, Texas.

In addition, in December 2011, we were selected by the University of Kentucky ("UK") to develop, own and manage a multi-phase project aimed at revitalizing UK's on-campus housing, which could potentially include the revitalization and replacement of UK's campus housing properties to more than 9,000 beds over five to seven years utilizing the ONE PlanSM. As of December 31, 2016, we had completed the following developments at UK under the ONE PlanSM:

• | Lymon T. Johnson Hall and Central Hall II, which opened in August 2013;


• | Haggin Hall, Frances Jewell Hall, Georgia M. Blazer Hall and Woodland Glen I & II, all of which opened in August 2014;


• | Woodland Glen III, IV and V, all of which opened in August 2015; and


• | Holmes Hall and Boyd Hall, which opened in August 2016.

Construction on University Flats and Lewis Hall, totaling 1,117 beds, both of which are expected to be delivered in the summer of 2017, are progressing as planned. The UK developments are owned and managed pursuant to long-term leases or ground leases.
We believe the Trust will continue to enter into more partnerships under the ONE PlanSM due to our proven on-campus development and management experience, size, transparency and financial strength. We believe the ONE PlanSM allows us to provide the perfect opportunity to universities to develop new housing and boost enrollment with a plan tailored to specific needs while simultaneously preserving the university’s credit capacity.
In total, we currently have thirteen owned developments that we expect to deliver in 2017, 2018 and 2019, including five ONE PlanSM developments at the University of Kentucky (two ongoing developments), Boise State University, Northern Michigan University, and Cornell University and eight joint venture developments at Michigan State University, Texas State University, Oklahoma State University, University of Pittsburgh, Florida State University, University of Minnesota, Arizona State University and University of Hawai'i. 
Joint Ventures
In 2011, we began entering into joint venture agreements to develop, own and manage collegiate housing communities. In addition to the joint ventures under development discussed above, we previously developed and currently manage properties under joint venture arrangements serving the University of Alabama, which opened in August 2012; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix and the University of Mississippi, both of which opened in August 2013; Duke University, which opened in August 2014; the University of Louisville, which opened in August 2015; Virginia Tech, which opened in August 2016; and the University of Wisconsin and the University of Arizona, both of which were acquired in 2016. We subsequently acquired the minority interests in the collegiate housing communities at the University of Alabama, the University of Mississippi, Arizona State University - Downtown Phoenix, Duke University, the University of Louisville and Virginia Tech. We are now the 100% owner of those properties, except for the property serving Duke University as it was subsequently sold during 2016. 
In some cases, we hold a non-majority ownership interest in properties and earn a fee for the management of the properties. In December 2012, we invested in a joint venture with GEM Realty Capital to jointly develop and own new off-campus collegiate housing serving the University of Minnesota. We are a 50% owner of the property, which opened in August 2014. We entered into a second joint venture with GEM Realty Capital to jointly develop and own new off-campus collegiate housing serving the University of Georgia. We are a 50% owner of the property, which opened in August 2015. We also manage these communities, but we do not consolidate these two joint ventures in our financial statements.
4

Our joint venture strategy enables us to source and take advantage of opportunities not otherwise available to us and to accretively diversify our portfolio by expanding into geographic markets where we are not currently present with lower capital requirements than if we acquired the properties after completion. We expect to continue pursuing joint venture arrangements in the future. 
Operating Strategy
We seek to maximize net operating income of the collegiate housing communities that we own and manage through the following operational strategies.
Maximize revenue.  We have developed and implemented proactive marketing practices to enhance the visibility of our collegiate housing communities and to optimize our revenue. We study our competitors, our residents and university policies affecting enrollment and housing. Based on our findings at each property, we formulate a marketing and sales plan for each academic leasing period. This plan is closely monitored and adjusted, if necessary, throughout the leasing period using our PILOT leasing management system, giving us the flexibility in finding the optimal mix of rate and occupancy. We intend to continue to market our properties to students, parents and universities by emphasizing collegiate-oriented living areas, state-of-the-art technology and infrastructure, a wide variety of amenities and services and close proximity to university campuses.
Controlling costs.  We seek to maximize property-level profitability through the use of cost control systems and our focused on-site management personnel. Some of our specific cost control initiatives include:

• | establishing internal controls and procedures for consistent cost control throughout our communities;


• | operating with flat property-level management structures, minimizing multiple layers of management; and


• | negotiating service-level pricing arrangements with national and regional vendors and requiring corporate-level approval of service agreements for each community.

Maintain the physical assets in top condition. We strive to maintain our assets in the best condition through an intense property and asset management focus. We conduct periodic preventive maintenance, quarterly inspection of units, perform annual turn and ongoing capital investments to protect and grow existing property values. 
Maintain and develop strategic relationships.  We believe that establishing and maintaining relationships with universities and developers, owners and brokers of collegiate housing properties is important to the ongoing success of our business. We believe that these relationships will continue to provide us with referrals that enhance our leasing efforts, opportunities for additional acquisitions of collegiate housing communities and contracts for third-party services.
Develop and retain personnel.  We staff each collegiate housing community that we own or manage with a full-service on-site property management team. Each of our property management teams includes community assistants who plan activities and interact with residents, enhancing their college experiences. We have developed programs and procedures to train each team of on-site employees and to provide them with corporate-based support for each essential operating function. To retain employees, we have developed an incentive-based compensation structure that is available to all of our key on-site personnel.
Third-Party Services Strategy
In addition to developing communities for our ownership and managing our owned collegiate housing communities, we seek to provide development and management consulting services for universities and other third-party owners who rely upon the private sector for assistance in developing and managing their collegiate housing properties. We perform third-party services in order to enhance our reputation with universities and to benefit our primary goal of owning high-quality collegiate housing communities. We perform third-party services for collegiate housing communities serving some of the nation’s most prominent systems of higher education, including the University of North Carolina, the California State University System and the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. In order to comply with the rules applicable to our status as a REIT, we provide our third-party services through our Development Company and our Management Company. Unlike the income earned from our properties owned by the Trust, the income earned by our Development Company and our Management Company is subject to regular federal income tax and state and local income taxes where applicable.

Third-party development consulting services
We provide third-party development consulting services primarily to universities seeking to modernize their on-campus collegiate housing communities but also to other third-party investors. We typically are notified that we have been awarded development consulting services projects on the basis of a competitive award process and thereafter begin work on the project. In the case of tax exempt bond-financed projects, definitive contracts are not executed until bond closing. Our development consulting services typically include the following:

• | market analysis and evaluation of housing needs and options;


• | cooperation with university in architectural design;


• | negotiation of ground lease, development agreement, construction contract, architectural contract and bond documents;


• | oversight of architectural design process;


• | coordination of governmental and university plan approvals;


• | oversight of construction process;


• | design of layout, purchase and installation of furniture;


• | pre-opening marketing to potential residents; and


• | obtaining final approvals of construction.

By providing these services, we are able to observe emerging trends in collegiate housing development and market acceptance of unit and community amenities. Our development consulting services also provide us with opportunities to obtain additional third-party property management contracts. Of the 26 clients for whom we have provided development-consulting services since 2000, we currently provide third-party management services under contracts with 12 of those clients while the 14 remaining clients alternatively elected to manage the communities in-house under their existing infrastructure. In 2016, our fees from third-party development consulting services represented 0.8% of our revenues, excluding operating expense reimbursements.
Since 2000, we have provided third-party development consulting services to clients for projects totaling approximately $1.6 billion in value. We are currently providing third-party development services pursuant to signed definitive contracts with projects under construction at East Stroudsburg University - Pennsylvania Ph II, Texas A&M - Commerce and Shepherd University.
Third-party management services
We provide third-party management services for collegiate housing communities owned by educational institutions, charitable foundations and others. Our management services typically cover all aspects of operations, including residence life and student development, marketing, leasing administration, strategic relationships, information systems and accounting services. These services are comparable to the services that we provide for our owned portfolio. We typically provide these services pursuant to multi-year management agreements. These agreements usually have an initial term of two to five years with renewal options of similar terms. We believe that providing these services allows us to leverage our existing management expertise and infrastructure. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our fees from third-party management services represented 1.3% of our revenue, excluding operating expense reimbursements. As of December 31, 2016, we provided third-party management services for 22 collegiate housing communities containing 11,767 beds in 4,214 units on or near 17 university campuses located in 11 states.
Our Operations
We staff each of our owned and managed collegiate housing communities with a full-service property management team. We typically staff each property with one community manager, a marketing/leasing manager, a resident services manager, a maintenance supervisor, one on-site resident community assistant for each 75-100 residents and general office and maintenance staff. Each property management team markets, leases and manages the community with a focus on maximizing its profitability. In addition, each property management team is trained to provide social and developmental opportunities for residents, enhancing the residents’ college experiences as well as the desirability of our communities.
We have developed policies and procedures to carefully select and develop each team of on-site employees and to provide each team with corporate-based support for each essential operating area, including lease administration, sales/marketing, community and university relations, student life administration, maintenance, loss prevention, accounting, human resources/benefits administration and information systems. The corporate level personnel responsible for each of these areas support each community manager’s leadership role and are available as a resource to the community managers around the clock.

Residence Life and Student Development
Our Vice President of Operations oversees the designs and direction of our residence life program. Our programs are developed at the corporate level and implemented at each community by our community assistants, together with our other on-site personnel. We provide educational, social and recreational activities designed to help students achieve academic goals, promote respect and harmony throughout the community and help bridge interaction with the respective university. Examples of our residence life and student development programs include:

• | community-building and social activities geared to university-related events, holidays, public safety and education;


• | study and attention skills counseling;


• | career development, resume writing and employment search skill training;


• | sponsorship of intramural sport teams, academic clubs and alumni-based activities;


• | parent and resident appreciation events;


• | community service activities including recycling, blood drives, food drives and student volunteer committees;


• | lectures focused on social issues, including effective communication, multi-cultural awareness and substance abuse;


• | university outreach activities; and


• | voter registration, enrollment and education.

The community assistants perform key roles in the administrative functioning of the community and interface with residents through constructive programs, activities and listening to resident interests and concerns. Our on-site leadership selects residents to serve as community assistants who meet criteria established by our Vice President of Client Relations.
Marketing
We begin our annual marketing campaign by thoroughly segmenting the student population attending each of the primary universities where our collegiate housing communities are located, and compiling market surveys of comparable collegiate apartment properties. With this information, we formulate a marketing/sales strategy that consists of a renewal campaign for current residents and a broader campaign directed at the eligible student population. We assess university regulations regarding housing requirements to avoid targeting segments of the market in which students are not eligible to live off-campus.
We typically begin our renewal campaign in October of each year. Signage, social networking, direct mailings to the students and their parents, appreciation parties and staff selling incentives are key elements of the renewal campaign. The community assistant team plays a key role in communicating the renewal message throughout its assigned property area. We use a database of current resident demographic data to direct sales information to primary feeder high schools, particularly where new freshmen are eligible to live off-campus. Other database criteria include gender, high school location, prior apartment community, academic class standing, field of study and activity preferences.
We appeal to the greater university population through theme-based newspaper advertising campaigns, open house activities, housing fairs conducted by the university, web-based advertising and social networking media. Our professional leasing and marketing staff targets certain university-sponsored on-campus events to distribute handouts displaying our logo and offering incentives to visit our sales center. Wherever possible, our collegiate housing communities appear on university websites in listings of off-campus housing options, together with banner advertising where available.
Leasing
Our standard lease begins in mid-August of each year and runs for approximately 11.5 months, ending July 31 or early August of each year to coincide with each university’s fall academic term. The primary exceptions to our standard lease term is our University Towers, University Village on Colvin and the UK communities, which we generally rent on nine-month academic year leases, and The Berk on College and The Berk on Arch communities, which we generally rent on eight-month academic year leases. Our standard lease is an agreement between the student and parental guarantor, and the specific collegiate housing community. With the exception of our collegiate housing near the University of Connecticut and two communities near the University of Virginia which serve a variety of resident types and rents by the unit, all leases are for a bed in a private or shared bedroom, with rights to share common areas within the unit and throughout the community. This “individual lease” is a strong selling attraction as it limits a student’s liability to the rental for one bed or bedroom instead of burdening the student with shared liability for the entire unit rental amount.
7

We lease our units by floor plan type using PILOT, our property leasing/marketing system, to maximize full leasing of entire units and avoid spotty vacancies, particularly in our four-bedroom units. We offer roommate-matching services to facilitate full occupancy. We develop waiting lists and monitor popular floor plans that fill to capacity early in the leasing season. 
Unlike conventional apartment communities that have monthly move-outs and renewals, our collegiate housing community occupancies remain relatively stable throughout the academic year, but must be entirely re-leased at the beginning of each academic year. Because of the nature of leasing to students, we are highly dependent upon the success of our marketing and leasing efforts during the annual leasing season, generally October through August. Our leasing staff undergoes intensive annual professional training to maximize the success of our leasing efforts.
We typically require rent to be paid in 12 equal installments throughout the lease term, with the first installment due on July 15 of that year. Residents of University Towers and residence halls that we manage for third parties typically pay their annual rent in two installments on July 1 and December 1 of each year. We replace contracted residents who fail to pay the first installment with people on our waiting list or from walk-in traffic while the market is still active with students seeking housing at the commencement of the academic year.
Strategic Relationships
We assign high priority to establishing and nurturing relationships with the administration of each of the primary universities where our collegiate housing communities are located. Our corporate staff establishes this network, and on-site management then sustains and enhances the relationship with follow-up by corporate staff during routine visits to the community. As a result of our strategic relationships, universities often refer their students to our properties, thus enhancing our leasing effort throughout the year. These networks create goodwill for our collegiate housing communities throughout the university administration, including departments of admissions, student affairs, public safety, athletics and international affairs.
Most universities promote off-campus housing alternatives to their student population. It is our intention to be among the most preferred off-campus residences and for universities to include our communities in listings and literature provided to students. We seek to obtain student mailing lists used by universities and to be featured in web-based collegiate housing listings wherever permitted by the institution and incorporate these initiatives into our marketing efforts. Our community managers make scheduled personal visits to academic departments at the universities to further our community exposure at this level.
In addition to our university relationships, our management team has developed long-standing relationships with developers, owners and brokers of collegiate housing properties that allow us to identify and capitalize on acquisition opportunities. As a result, we have generated an internal database of contacts that we use to identify and evaluate acquisition candidates. As it is our intention to develop a diverse portfolio of collegiate housing communities, we also develop strategic relationships with equity investors in order to pursue acquisitions through joint venture arrangements.
Competition
Competition from universities
We typically compete for residents with the owners of on-campus collegiate housing, which is generally owned by educational institutions or charitable foundations. Educational institutions generally do not have to pay real estate taxes and may be able borrow funds at lower interest rates, while we and other private sector operators pay full real estate tax rates and have higher borrowing costs. The competitive advantages of on-campus collegiate housing also include its physical proximity to the university campus and captive student body. Moreover, many universities have policies requiring students to live in their on-campus facilities during their freshman year.
On-campus housing is limited, however, and most universities are able to house only a small percentage of their students. As a result, educational institutions depend upon, and may serve as referral sources for, private providers of off-campus housing. In addition, off-campus housing facilities tend to offer greater amenities and more relaxed rules and regulations than on-campus properties and therefore tend to be more appealing to students. Off-campus collegiate housing offers freedom from restrictions, such as quiet hours or gender visitation limitations, and is especially appealing to upperclassmen who are transitioning toward greater independence.
8

Competition from private owners
We compete with several regional and national owner-operators of off-campus collegiate housing, including a publicly-traded competitor, American Campus Communities, Inc. (NYSE: ACC). We also compete with privately held developers, other real estate firms and smaller local owner-operators in a number of the markets in which we operate. Currently, the collegiate housing industry is fragmented with no participant holding a dominant market share. We believe that a number of other large national companies with substantial financial resources may be potential entrants into the collegiate housing business. The entry of one or more of these companies could increase competition for residents and for the acquisition, management and development of collegiate housing properties. We believe the main competitive factors in our industry include proximity to campus, amenities, rental rates and service reputation. Our portfolio has strong characteristics such as close proximity to campus (median distance is 0.1 miles), extensive amenities, bed/bath parity, extensive resident’s life programming, on-site professional management and relatively new communities (average age of seven years). Our rental rates align with these characteristics and the market we serve, although our rates may be higher than individual competitor’s. 
Environmental Matters
As a current or prior owner, manager and developer of real estate, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our properties. Environmental laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the costs of any required investigation or cleanup of these substances can be substantial. The liability is generally not limited under such laws and could exceed the property’s value and the aggregate assets of the liable party. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties also may expose us to third-party liability for personal injury or property damage, or adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop the real property or to borrow using the real property as collateral. These and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in “Item 1A. — Risk Factors” below.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 1,280 employees, including:

• | 1,127 on-site employees, including 353 community assistants;


• | 38 employees in our property management services department;


• | 39 employees in our development consulting services and construction departments; and


• | 76 executive, corporate administration and financial personnel.
