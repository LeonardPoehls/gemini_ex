The Company’s flagship SharpSpring marketing automation platform uses advanced features such as web tracking, lead scoring and automated workflow to help businesses deliver the right message to the right customer at the right time. All of our products are designed and built as Software as Service (or SaaS) offerings.

  Products and Services
  
  SharpSpring Marketing Automation and SharpSpring Mail+
  
 We provide SaaS based marketing technologies to customers around the world. Our focus is on marketing automation tools that enable customers to interact with a lead from an early stage and nurture that potential customer using advanced features until it becomes a qualified sales lead or customer. Our primary product is the premium SharpSpring marketing automation solution. Additionally, a small portion of customers utilizes our SharpSpring Mail+ product, which is a subset of the full suite solution that is focused on more traditional email marketing while also including some of the advanced functionality available in our premium offering.
 Discontinued and Divested Products and Services:
  
  GraphicMail Email Marketing
  
 During 2015 and the first half of 2016, the Company offered the GraphicMail email campaign management solution to customers globally. In late 2015, the Company announced that it would discontinue selling and offering the GraphicMail email solution and migrate existing GraphicMail customers to the SharpSpring platform, onto the SharpSpring Mail+ product. Prior to the migration, the GraphicMail platform focused on email, social and mobile marketing and was typically used by companies wishing to communicate with a list of subscribers or customers.
 SMTP Email Relay Services
  
 On June 27, 2016, we sold the assets related to our SMTP email relay product to the Electric Mail Company, a Nova Scotia company. Prior to that, the Company offered a proprietary SMTP relay product, which was designed to send high volumes of email messages in an efficient manner and increase the delivery rate of email messages.
 Markets & Competition
  
 We operate in the marketing technology market, with a focus on marketing automation products. Our products compete in two markets that are interrelated and often overlap with each other:
  
   1)
 Marketing automation products (highly targeted one-to-one messaging with sophisticated analytics); and 

   2)
 Traditional email marketing services (newsletters and one-to-many communications).

 Our SharpSpring product competes primarily in the marketing automation market. Based on industry reports, our growth rate and the growth rate of our competitors, we believe the market for marketing automation technology is currently growing at approximately 30% per year. The market for marketing automation software and related solutions is new and evolving, with high barriers to entry due to the complex nature of the technology. SharpSpring entered the market in 2014 with a highly competitive offering that achieved meaningful customer adoption in its first few years after launch. As of December 31, 2017, SharpSpring had 1,750 paying customers and approximately 6,500 businesses using the platform, including agencies, agency clients and direct end user customers. We face competition from cloud-based software and SaaS companies including HubSpot, Act-On, Pardot and Infusionsoft. We differentiate ourselves from the competition with the integration of specific tools designed for digital marketing agencies, and with SharpSpring’s advanced features, ease of use, platform flexibility, and value compared to other competitive offerings. SharpSpring is designed as a solution for small or mid-sized businesses, but focuses on selling to marketing agencies, who serve as partners providing a distribution channel to their clients.
  
 Since inception, the majority of our SharpSpring customers have been digital marketing agencies. A digital marketing agency is a firm that specializes in helping clients, usually small or mid-sized businesses, with their digital marketing initiatives like websites, email marketing, search engine optimization, social campaigns and other lead generation activities. We have built special tools in the SharpSpring application to allow agencies to manage their clients and optimize their efforts across their portfolio. We also have special pricing to agency customers to allow them the flexibility to manage their client relationships. In general, when we sell SharpSpring to an agency customer, we provide the agency with a SharpSpring license for the agency to use plus a 3-pack of client licenses for the agency to deploy to their client base. This agency license and the pack of licenses are generally sold for a monthly recurring fee, plus an up-front onboarding fee. The agency has complete discretion over the pricing of the platform to their clients for the use, implementation and services related to SharpSpring. If an agency utilizes its pack of licenses and adds additional clients on to the platform, there is a monthly per-client fee charged to the agency. Additionally, we charge customers for certain items if volume or transactional limits are exceeded. In most cases, we provide support to the agency and the agency provides support to their clients on the platform, but for additional fees, we can support the agency’s client directly. Our mentality is to partner with the agencies to grow and expand our businesses together using the SharpSpring platform.
  
 SharpSpring Mail+ was launched in 2016 as a replacement to the GraphicMail product that was acquired in 2014. SharpSpring Mail+ provides customers with an advanced email marketing and marketing automation tool. It includes traditional email campaign management solutions like design capabilities, reporting tools and list management functionality, but also includes additional features like dynamic email content and SharpSpring’s visitor ID tool that are more typically found in a marketing automation solution. SharpSpring Mail+ competes with companies such as Constant Contact, iContact Corporation, The Rocket Science Group LLC (MailChimp®), and VerticalResponse, Inc., a subsidiary of Deluxe Corporation, as well as other email and marketing automation companies. SharpSpring Mail+, and most other vendors, typically charge a monthly fee or a fee per number of emails sent and, in some cases, they have a free offering for low-volume or non-profit customers. SharpSpring Mail+’s rich feature set and comparative value plus personalized messages that enable customers to grow their business are key market differentiators.
  
 We are part of a constantly evolving and highly competitive marketplace. Some of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we have, and have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have. Additionally, some of our current and potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, and are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products and services. Barriers to entry are relatively high in the marketing automation market due to complexity of systems.
  
  Sales and Marketing
  
 We sell our products globally, through our internal sales teams, and to a lesser extent, third party resellers. Before the discontinuation of GraphicMail and the sale of our SMTP email relay product, our products had separate and mostly distinct sales processes, which are described below. We use and rely on our own SharpSpring marketing automation platform to help our business generate leads, convert more leads to sales and monitor the effectiveness of all our marketing campaigns. Our website www.sharpspring.com serves as a lead generation source and we use a variety of other digital marketing tools to attract new customers.

 Our SharpSpring product sales process involves targeting customers, completing product demos and advancing customers through our marketing and sales pipeline to conversion using our SharpSpring marketing automation product. Since SharpSpring was launched fairly recently in 2014, brand recognition today is growing, but still fairly limited. Therefore, we are more reliant on outbound marketing and search engine traffic to attract potential leads. Our marketing efforts to date have been nearly 100% focused on digital marketing agencies, and we have had success signing up over 1,400 marketing agency partners as of December 31, 2017. These agencies become customers of ours and are able to resell SharpSpring to their clients, while paying increased fees to us as their client count expands beyond the base license. This allows the agency to provide services and first level support for their clients, which increases their own revenues from the end client and creates a longer-lasting relationship overall between the agency and client. We also sell SharpSpring directly to end-users and have over 300 direct end user customers on the platform. The Company’s sales are done primarily through internal resources, but a small number of third-party resellers were also used during 2017.
  
 Since creating the SharpSpring Mail+ product to migrate the GraphicMail customers onto during the middle of 2016, we have spent limited resources marketing and selling SharpSpring Mail+ as a standalone product. We intend to continue to devote limited resources to the sales and marketing process for SharpSpring Mail+ as a standalone product in the future, and may decide to discontinue the SharpSpring Mail+ product altogether.
  
 Prior to its discontinuation in the middle of 2016, our GraphicMail sales and marketing efforts were designed to attract potential customers to our website, enroll them in a free trial, encourage them to engage with our products, convert them to paying customers and retain them as ongoing customers. We employed strategies to acquire customers by using a variety of sources, including online advertising, partner relationships and referrals. Additionally, GraphicMail used a network of third party resellers who distributed and sold GraphicMail in 14 countries. These resellers acted as local sales resources, performed marketing for the product and provided first level support, and received a large portion of the revenue related to sales of GraphicMail through those organizations. The Company discontinued the GraphicMail product and ended any reselling arrangements for GraphicMail with third parties.
  
 Prior to its sale in June 2016, SMTP relay services were sold and leads were largely generated by the SMTP.com website. SMTP stands for “Simple Mail Transfer Protocol”, which is the internet protocol by which all email is sent globally. Despite the fact that we did not own the protocol, the SMTP name provided us immediate name recognition and domain context worldwide. In addition, the services we provided may be searched for online as “SMTP”, “SMTP relay services”, “SMTP services”, “SMTP providers”, or using similar terms. Our website may have appeared in search engine results for these and other queries in common search engines. In addition, SMTP purchased online search advertising and other forms of online advertising to drive traffic to the website and referring partners provided us with leads. Referring partners were typically other service providers operating in the email ecosystem, who may provide related products and services that were non-competitive with our own. We paid those third parties between 15% and 30% of the revenue generated from their referrals.
  
  Customers
  
 As of December 31, 2017, we had over 1,750 customers for our SharpSpring product, the majority of which were marketing agencies. Including agency partners, agency clients and direct end user clients, we had over 6,500 businesses using the SharpSpring platform as of December 31, 2017.
  
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 1,000 customers using our SharpSpring Mail+ product.
  
 The vast majority of our customers are on month-to-month agreements, with a mixture of customers being charged in advance and in arrears. We have a small amount of customers that prepay for longer periods, such as quarterly or annually.
  
 We are not heavily dependent on any one customer or even a few major customers. Our user base is diverse and the largest single customer represents less than 3% of our aggregate revenues. The loss of any one customer would not represent a material loss of sales. A large majority of our SharpSpring customers are marketing agencies who resell the SharpSpring product to their clients. From a client or end user perspective, we do not have any significant industry concentration in our customer base.

  Technology & Technology Suppliers
  
 Our SharpSpring product technology was developed internally over the past six years. SharpSpring’s key features include web tracking, customer relationship management, lead scoring and nurturing, landing pages, email technology, rule-based triggers and notifications and deep analytics to measure marketing program return on investment (ROI). We offer value to our customers by providing integration with industry standard technologies like Salesforce.com and others, and third-party data providers like Zoominfo.
  
  
SharpSpring Mail+ is a subset of the SharpSpring technology. During late 2015 and the first half of 2016, we modified SharpSpring to support the SharpSpring Mail+ features and functionality using the existing platform. This involved creating a subset of the SharpSpring technology with more limited features for SharpSpring Mail+.

 
 We decommissioned the GraphicMail product in the middle of 2016. GraphicMail had been developed over the past nine years and consisted of an email editor that customers used to create sharp, professional email campaigns. It had an easy to use interface, integrated with social media channels, offered mobile messaging and included tools to effectively track campaign results. GraphicMail historically utilized Postfix software to assist in spooling emails, which is an open source technology, but began using the SMTP relay service during 2015 as its primary email sending platform.
  
 The Company sold the SMTP relay service in June 2016. The SMTP relay service product used Message Transfer Agent (MTA) technology provided by Message Systems, a third party. Typically, our SMTP relay service customers would be too small and spend too little on email to be able to afford this type of sophisticated system on their own. The SMTP solution pooled a large number of customers into our proprietary and scalable system that handled billions of emails. The software was customized to optimize the speed at which email is delivered, and to manage the process of maximizing inbox delivery. The proprietary systems managed how emails are sent, and which IP addresses or pools of IP addresses were used for sending. Another key part of our technological assets were our 12,286 portable IPv4 addresses (which were sold along with the product).
  
 Email sending technology is a key part of the application. Following the sale of the SMTP product in June 2016, we rely on a third party to deliver our platform’s email. During the period of time before the sale of the SMTP product in June 2016, we employed Message Systems as the backbone of our sending. During the first half of 2016, we also employed Postfix software for certain functions. PostFix software is open source and has been released under the IBM Public License 1.0, giving us and others rights to freely utilize and modify the software at our discretion and without cost. We operated the software in a clean unmodified state. We developed proprietary extensions that plugged into the PostFix software in an effort to optimize the speed at which email is delivered, and to manage the process of maximizing inbox delivery. Customizations to open source software code generally require developers to make their work available at no cost. Since we developed the software by creating extensions which live outside of the open source software layer, we were not required to offer our products or make our source code available.
  
 Our platforms are hosted in third party data centers on virtual cloud-based infrastructure. During 2017, these providers included Google Compute and Amazon Web Services. These data centers use a mixture of biometric access controls, redundant power, environmental controls and secure internet connection points to ensure uptime and data security. The Company continuously monitors our services for availability, performance and security. When necessary we send engineers to these third-party providers’ locations to maintain quality control and oversight. We rely on our data center providers to maintain peak operating conditions in their businesses and to quickly address issues related to their service as they arise.

 We registered “SharpSpring” and the related logo and certain other marks as trademarks in the United States and several other jurisdictions.
  
 We are the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include “sharpspring”, “sharpspringmailplus”, “graphicmail” and similar variations.
  
  Regulation of our Business
  
 We must comply with U.S. federal legislation entitled Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or CAN-SPAM Act, which imposes certain obligations on the senders of commercial emails and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content.
  
 The CAN-SPAM Act’s main provisions include:
  
  ●
  prohibiting false or misleading email header information

  ●
  prohibiting the use of deceptive subject lines

  ●
  ensuring that recipients may, for at least 30 days after an email is sent, opt out of receiving future commercial email messages from the sender, with the opt-out effective within 10 days of the request

  ●
  requiring that commercial email be identified as a solicitation or advertisement unless the recipient affirmatively assented to receiving the message

  ●
  requiring that the sender include a valid postal address in the email message

 
 In addition, some states have passed laws regulating commercial email practices that are significantly more punitive and difficult to comply with than the CAN-SPAM Act, particularly Utah and Michigan, which have enacted do-not-email registries listing minors who do not wish to receive unsolicited commercial email that markets certain covered content, such as adult or other harmful products. Some portions of these state laws may not be preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act. Additionally, some foreign jurisdictions, such as Australia, Canada and the European Union, have also enacted laws that regulate sending email, some of which are more restrictive than the CAN-SPAM Act. For example, some foreign laws prohibit sending unsolicited email unless the recipient has provided the sender advance consent to receipt of such email, or in other words has “opted-in” to receiving it.
  
 The ability of our customers’ constituents to opt out of receiving commercial emails may minimize the effectiveness of our email marketing product. Moreover, non-compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act carries significant financial penalties. If we were found to be in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act, applicable state laws not preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act, or foreign laws regulating the distribution of commercial email, whether as a result of violations by our customers or if we were deemed to be directly subject to and in violation of these requirements, we could be required to pay penalties, which would adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business. We also may be required to change one or more aspects of the way we operate our business, which could impair our ability to attract and retain customers or increase our operating costs.
  
 As internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign governments becomes more likely. Our business could be negatively impacted by the application of existing laws and regulations or the enactment of new laws applicable to email communications. The cost to comply with such laws or regulations could be significant and would increase our operating expenses, and we may be unable to pass along those costs to our customers in the form of increased subscription fees. In addition, federal, state and foreign governmental or regulatory agencies may decide to impose taxes on services provided over the Internet or via email. Such taxes could discourage the use of the Internet and email as a means of commercial marketing and communications, which would adversely affect the viability of our services.

 Additionally, certain aspects of how our customers utilize our platform are subject to regulations in the United States, European Union and elsewhere. In recent years, U.S. and European lawmakers and regulators have expressed concern over the use of third-party cookies or web beacons for online behavioral advertising, and legislation adopted recently in the European Union requires informed consent for the placement of a cookie on a user’s device. Regulation of cookies and web beacons may lead to restrictions on our activities, such as efforts to understand users’ Internet usage. New and expanding “Do Not Track” regulations have recently been enacted or proposed that protect users’ right to choose whether or not to be tracked online. These regulations seek, among other things, to allow end users to have greater control over the use of private information collected online, to forbid the collection or use of online information, to demand a business to comply with their choice to opt out of such collection or use, and to place limits upon the disclosure of information to third party websites. These policies could have a significant impact on the operation of our marketing automation platform and could impair our attractiveness to customers, which would harm our business.
  
 The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) seeks to create a data protection law framework across the EU and aims to give citizens back the control of their personal data, whilst imposing strict rules on those hosting and 'processing' this data, anywhere in the world. The Regulation also introduces rules relating to the free movement of personal data within and outside the EU. The GDPR will come into effect on May 25, 2018.
  
 Customers and potential customers in the healthcare, financial services and other industries are subject to substantial regulation regarding their collection, use and protection of data and may be the subject of further regulation in the future. Accordingly, these laws or significant new laws or regulations or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws, regulations or governmental policy may change the way these customers do business and may require us to implement additional features or offer additional contractual terms to satisfy customer and regulatory requirements, or could cause the demand for and sales of our marketing automation platform to decrease and adversely impact our financial results.
  
  Employees
  
 As of February 28, 2018, we have approximately 149 employees supporting our operations. Nearly all of our employees devote their full effort to the company. Our resources include 40 sales and marketing resources, 37 research and development resources, 15 general & administrative resources and 57 customer services, network and support resources. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
  
 We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire or acquire and retain qualified employees and contractors. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such resources. If we are unsuccessful in managing the timely delivery of these services our business could be adversely affected. We believe we have good relations with our resources.

 Our corporate headquarters is a leased office facility located in Gainesville, FL.
  
  Financial Information About Segments
