ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview of Our Business 
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 15, 2013, under the name “I In The Sky, Inc.” On July 22, 2015, we changed the company name to our current name. Our original business plan was to manufacture and market low cost GPS tracking devices and software to businesses and families. However this business was not successful and we had no revenues generated from our business until April 12, 2016 when we completed our reverse acquisition of AEEGCL.
 
AEEGCL is a company incorporated under the laws of Samoa on May 29, 2015. Effective November 30, 2015, we executed a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) to acquire 100% of the shares and assets of AEEGCL, in exchange for one billion (1,000,000,000) shares of common stock of the Company that were issued to the owners of AEEGCL. The transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement were closed on April 12, 2016. As a result, our previous business plan was terminated and we are currently engaged in the business of AEEGCL.
 
AEEGCL offers an international equity assistance and information service platform designed to provide member registration services, equity investment financing information to enterprises in Asia, mainly in China. Currently 34 companies are registered with us, and additional 36 companies are in the process of preparing the necessary documents for registration with us. All companies currently registered with us are located in China, as are the additional companies in the process.
 
Our member registration services refer to companies seeking to join our equity investment and financing information dissemination platform. All medium and small-sized enterprises in Asia can apply to register with us. They can distribute their basic information, project status, financial status and equity structure information through our platform to attract individual investors and investment institutions all over the world. Our current focus is on helping companies in China which seek financing while we plan to offer our services in other Asian countries where we can assist with a company’s public and investor awareness and investor relationship needs and financing needs. Where we can, we will assist companies by finding appropriate legal as well as accounting services. We do not work with companies planning to become SEC reporting companies or that intend to begin trading on U.S. markets.
 
AEEGCL owns 100% of AEEX HK, a Hong Kong corporation incorporated on December 22, 2014. AEEX HK owns 100% of Asian & American Consultant (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd., a corporation incorporated in the PRC on April 15, 2015. Both AEEX HK and AACCL are engaged in the provision of investment and corporate management consultancy services.
 
The acquisition of AEEGCL and its subsidiaries by us was accounted for as a reverse merger because on a post-merger basis, the former shareholders of AEEGCL held a majority of our outstanding common stock on a fully-diluted basis. As a result, AEEGCL is deemed to be the acquirer for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statement data presented are those of AEEGCL, recorded at the historical basis of AEEGCL, for all periods prior to our acquisition of AEEGCL on April 12, 2016, and the financial statements of the historical operations of the consolidated companies from the effective date of the closing of the reverse merger.
 
We generated revenues of $563,363 and $nil for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We had a net loss of $255,800 in 2016 and a net loss of $44,435 in 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $387,719 and net assets of $734,568.
 
On July 8, 2015, our board of directors authorized a change in our fiscal year end from September 30, 2015 to December 31, 2015. We filed a transition report on form 10-Q for the transition period from October 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015. As a result of the change in fiscal year, our 2016 fiscal year began on January 1, 2016 and ended on December 31, 2016.

Our Corporate Structure 
 
All of our business operations are conducted primarily through our operating subsidiaries. The chart below presents our current corporate structure:
 


Our Business 
 
Many small and medium sized enterprises throughout Asia seek to take advantages of the potential offered by becoming a publicly traded company. Greater public awareness and the corresponding increased ability to have access to financing through international investment channels can make the transition from private to public company status a means by which a company can create real growth.
 
However, many enterprises may not be familiar with public company listing requirements and financing methods overseas. Management of these small to medium-sized companies find the rules and regulations difficult to comprehend, may consider the intricacies and potential costs too difficult to overcome, and are unable to realize the full potential of their enterprise.
 
In addition, the jurisdictions into which these companies might want to move may speak different languages and will have different securities laws and legal requirements.
 
To assist these enterprises, we have developed a program to seek out and engage local personnel with legal, regulatory and language expertise in those jurisdictions. We work to identify qualified personnel through a careful vetting and due diligence process.
 
Our multi-task service platform serves as a means not only for assisting these companies to secure public company listing and enhanced means of achieving financing overseas, but also assist overseas individual and institutional investors seeking quality equity investment. AEEX also provides registration, supervision and management services.
 
To accomplish these goals on behalf of our clients, we have established a number of corporate tools. These include:
 
Listing services:
 
We provide listing services to companies seeking to join our equity investment and financing information dissemination platform. Medium and small-sized enterprises in Asia can apply to list with us, but our current focus is on helping companies in China, which seek financing and increased public awareness of what they offer. Our services for companies that list with us relate primarily to markets and regulatory structures in China, but we plan to offer our services in other Asian countries where we can assist with a company’s public and investor awareness and investor relationship needs and with their financing needs. Where we can, we will assist companies by finding appropriate legal representation as well as accounting services. We do not work with companies planning to become SEC reporting companies or that want to begin trading on U.S. markets. We believe there are numerous US-based law firms and American consulting services that are better equipped to deal with those services.

We assist investors seeking investment opportunities and companies seeking international investment.
 
Since August 2015, we have carried out a number of roadshows in various cities such as Shenyang, Dalian, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Fuzhou and Shenzhen, which have extended our influence and enhanced our brand recognition.

We also ensure that we are in regular and efficient communication with all our clients who are planning to become a public company, or have already become public, and make certain that they have received the consulting services they need.
 
Where necessary, we will meet with clients on critical issues in public listing, or help them become familiar with important regulations in the securities markets and assist them in meeting the standards for going public. We also make sure that clients are updated with regulatory and legal changes.
 
Listing Solutions: We provide clients planning for a public listing with consulting services, which include models for reference and examples of successful cases. We also use our resources and experience to help clients connect directly with the corresponding securities regulatory commission.
 
Assistance with Negotiation and Implementation: With our advantages in resources and information, we assist clients with key negotiations with different parties and help them deal with various issues and problems before and after their public listing.
 
Funding Initiation: We use our resources to help clients who plan to go public, but face funding shortages to connect with venture capital, banks or other financial institutions that can provide potential assistance in their financing needs.
 
Client Equity Securitization Reform: We help to confirm the equity position of companies planning for going public, and provide assistance for them in working with qualified accounting and law firms to determine the share capital structure, stock par value and holding percentages of shareholders, and, where necessary, help clients to build a new equity structure in accordance with requirements of the relevant securities regulatory commission with whom the client is dealing.
 
Restructuring Consultancy: We work with qualified lawyers and auditing firms to help reorganize the client’s business model, procedures and organizational structure in order to maximize the client’s value and ensure that its public listing needs and requirements are met.
 
Route Design: We plan and design the proper procedures and methods for going public on behalf of our clients based on their assets, financial position, operations and other conditions.
 
Team Establishment: In accordance with the conditions of the clients and requirements by the relevant securities regulatory commission, we assist the clients to establish an organizational structure and a management team best suited for going public.
 
“Headhunting” Services: We work with headhunting companies, i.e. companies that provide employment or recruiting services to find the most qualified managers and professionals to meet the specific needs of our clients.
 
Follow-up Service: We provide clients with continuous consultancy and following-up services throughout the entire public listing process, from planning and preparation to success in becoming a public company.
 
Merger and Acquisition Planning: A major feature of our service is overall merger and acquisition planning and assistance with listing on international main boards of various countries, assistance with the preparation and execution of overseas initial public offering efforts and main board listing through public shell companies by means of reverse merger.
 
One useful tool in the transition from private to public company is the reverse merger or reverse takeover.
 
In a reverse merger, the shareholders of a private company acquire a majority of the shares of a “shell company”. The shell company is a public company that does not have an active business operation or significant assets. The shell company is then merged with the private company. This makes the public company registration process less time consuming and potentially less expensive. To finalize the reverse merger, the private company trades shares with the public shell in exchange for the shell company’s stock, and the private enterprise becomes a public company.
 
With numerous jurisdictions with which to deal, these mergers can be difficult. For small private companies, extra-jurisdictional government regulations and laws governing mergers are often difficult to understand, and without careful planning, there is a high failure rate with companies conducting mergers and acquisitions. Careful planning and pre-merger research is vital. Many companies starting out do not have the experience or resources to do the research necessary to complete a successful merger and to see a successful entity emerge from the process.

Among other requirements for a successful merger is detailed advance evaluation of the merger target, and the evaluation of the merger organization and its business plan. Clients will also need experienced assistance to develop strategies as they move beyond the merger process. Assistance with post-merger or post-acquisition organization, negotiations and planning are also important elements in determining the client’s success or failure. We have designed a program specifically tailored to address those issues for companies seeking to go public by means of a merger.
 
Assistance with Public Company Corporate Management: Among the services provided by us on behalf of our clients are those corporate services that are fundamental to a company’s survival and success. These include:
 

● | Assistance with and the preparation of all internal corporate documents, including corporate resolutions, minutes, changes and amendments to corporate documents as required; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Assistance with and the preparation of required legal and regulatory documents, including, but not limited to disclosure statements and agreements, subscription agreements, federal, state and regulatory filings, such registration statement(s), as required; 
● | Assistance with the preparation of all required responses resulting from the filing of any of the aforesaid documents, and the preparation or assistance with the preparation of any and all required amendments to the aforesaid documents; 
● | Guidance for the proper maintenance of all required legal and regulatory filings related to the foregoing documents; 
● | Direct and continuous liaison with corporate attorneys, accountants and auditors on behalf of the enterprise; 
● | Assisting the client with the proper maintenance of all company files. 

 
Resource Matching: As we move forward in our business and increase our client base, we are working to establish long-term cooperation with a number of qualified accounting firms, law firms, investment banks, venture capital and other relevant institutions.
 
Developing Public Awareness: We are working to develop public awareness for clients through an in-house publication, by creating and producing road-shows for clients and by developing publicity materials as part of an ongoing commitment to help our client to achieve success.
 
Markets
 
Our market includes small and medium-sized enterprises (“SME”) in Asia, enterprises with financial requirements, enterprises seeking to increase public awareness and enterprises planning to expand their business internationally.
Competition 
 
There is a similar equity financing platform in China, the ‘National Equities Exchange and Quotations’ (NEEQ, www.neeq.cc). It is managed by the Chinese Government and has considerable support from the government itself. NEEQ has been in operation since September 2012, and currently services more than 5,000 listed companies. While its services are limited to mainland China, there is no assurance that other countries or groups will not initiate similar services to compete directly with us. NEEQ is a financial service platform which deals with both equity information services as well as equity trading. While we offer information services for clients, we are not involved with equity trading and we are not an equity trading market and it is important to note that we are not now nor does it intend to be a trading market or provide quotations services for its clients. It is a platform designed solely for equity investment information and financing information services. It facilitates connections and negotiations between investors and project management. We assist investors seeking investment opportunities and companies seeking international investment.
 
Additionally, the online equity information industry we are entering into is intensely competitive. Large companies may preempt the field if they view opportunities that have sufficient financial rewards to enter the market. We are a relatively late entry into a mature market for most online information services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop a profitable niche in this market. While we intend to find niche products and services relying on previously unexploited services, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this endeavor.

Government Regulations
 
Through AEEGCL and its Chinese subsidiaries, we are providing consulting services to our clients. Our platform is designed to provide information of equity investment and financing to medium and small-sized enterprises in Asia. Upon becoming member clients, we assist these enterprises to distribute information about themselves, their project status, financial status and equity structure information and use our platform to attract individual investors and investment institutions worldwide. Our business goal is to develop business partners not only in China but throughout Asia. However, at present we have only 26 business partners all of which are located in China. These partners include legal consulting and accounting firms which are also responsible for seeking out and identifying suitable business enterprise clients and to help these potential clients to understand what we offer and to assist these clients to register as members of our platform. As we move forward we will seek business partners and clients throughout Asia.
 
Our business is mainly conducted by our China-based subsidiary, AACCL. AACCL provides training courses for our business partners to help them understand our platform and provides management and business consultancy for our Chinese business clients. Such services are within the scope of AACCL’s business license and is permitted by Chinese laws. We established AACCL due to our expectation that most of the business will originate in China and, as such, we are required to have a Chinese entity to conduct business in China.
 
The business scope of AACCL registered and recorded with the Chinese government as required during incorporation of AACCL includes: engaging in enterprise management consulting, economic information consulting, corporate image planning and the research and development, import and export service of electronic products, computer software and hardware products. As a foreign-invested company in China, AACCL is subject to government regulations on foreign investment and business operation. Specifically, according to Article 14 of Law of the People’s Republic on Foreign-capital Enterprises, all foreign-invested enterprises should establish account books, conduct independent accounting, submit accounting reports and statements as required and accept supervision by the financial and tax authorities. If an enterprise with foreign capital refuses to maintain account books in China, the financial and tax authorities may impose a fine on it, and the industry and commerce administration authorities may order it to suspend operations or may revoke its business license. In addition, China adopted a new Labor Contract Law, effective on January 1, 2008, and issued its implementation rules, effective on September 18, 2008. The Labor Contract Law and related rules and regulations impose more stringent requirements on our Chinese subsidiaries with regard to, among others, minimum wages, severance payment and non-fixed-term employment contracts, time limits for probation periods, as well as the duration and the times that an employee can be placed on a fixed-term employment contract. Furthermore, pursuant to company law of China, our Chinese subsidiaries are required to allocate at least 10% of their annual after-tax profits determined in accordance with accounting standards and regulations of China to a statutory general reserve fund until the amounts in said fund reaches 50% of their registered capital.

Other than the required adherence to general business laws and regulatory disclosure as described above, our services do not appear to be affected by any specific Chinese government regulations. However, this does not preclude the possibility that China will institute regulations that will make it difficult or impossible for us to operate successfully, if at all, in China, and we would have to focus our business on companies located outside China.
 
However, it should also be noted that our business is operated by AEEGCL, a company incorporated in Samoa. No special license is required for its operations in Samoa. Though most of its business currently comes from China, its Samoan operations are not subject to regulations by the Chinese government.
