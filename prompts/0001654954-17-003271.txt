  Recent Developments
  
  Reincorporation Merger and Davis Merger
  
 On October 26, 2016, Yuma Energy, Inc., a California corporation (“Yuma California”), merged with and into the Company resulting in the reincorporation from California to Delaware (the “Reincorporation Merger”). In connection with the Reincorporation Merger, Yuma California converted each outstanding share of its 9.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, no par value per share (the “Yuma California Series A Preferred Stock”), into 35 shares of its common stock, no par value per share (the “Yuma California Common Stock”), and then each share of Yuma California Common Stock was exchanged for one-twentieth of one share of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the Company (the “common stock”). Immediately after the Reincorporation Merger on October 26, 2016, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company merged (the “Davis merger”) with and into Davis Petroleum Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Davis”), in exchange for approximately 7,455,000 shares of common stock and 1,754,179 shares of Series D Convertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “Series D preferred stock”). The Series D preferred stock had an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $19.4 million and a conversion rate of $11.0741176 per share at the closing of the Davis Merger, and will be paid dividends in the form of additional shares of Series D preferred stock at a rate of 7% per annum. As a result of the Davis merger, the former holders of Davis common stock received approximately 61.1% of the then outstanding common stock of the Company and thus acquired voting control. Although the Company was the legal acquirer, for financial reporting purposes the Davis Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of the Company by Davis.
  
 As part of the closing of the Davis Merger, we entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with Sam L. Banks, RMCP PIV DPC, LP, RMCP PIV DPC II, LP, Davis Petroleum Investment, LLC, Sankaty Davis, LLC, Paul-ECP2 Holdings, LP, HarbourVest Partners VIII – Buyout Fund L.P., Dover Street VII L.P., Michael S. Reddin, Thomas E. Hardisty, Susan J. Davis, Gregory P. Schneider, and Steven Enger (collectively, the “Stockholders”), pursuant to which we agreed to register, at our cost, with the SEC the resale of the common stock issued to such holders of common stock and the common stock issued upon conversion of the Series D preferred stock. We agreed to file a shelf registration statement (the “Shelf Registration Statement”) with the SEC on or before April 24, 2017, subject to certain exceptions. The Stockholders may request registration no more than three times during any twelve (12) consecutive months, of shares having an estimated offering price of greater than $5.0 million. No request may be made after the fourth anniversary of the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement. In addition, if we file a registration statement within four years of the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, we must offer to the Stockholders the opportunity to include the resale of their shares in the registration statement, subject to customary qualifications and limitations.

 Subsequent to the Davis Merger, Ben T. Morris resigned from our board of directors and Stuart E. Davies, Neeraj Mital and J. Christopher Teets were appointed to our board of directors and Richard K. Stoneburner became the Non-Executive Chairman of the board of directors. Sam L. Banks continues to serve as Director, President and Chief Executive Officer, and James W. Christmas and Frank A. Lodzinski will also continue to serve as directors. Subsequent to the Davis Merger, on December 20, 2016, Mr. Davies resigned from the Board of Directors.
  
  Senior Credit Agreement
  
 On October 26, 2016, the Company and three of its subsidiaries, as the co-borrowers, entered into a credit agreement providing for a $75.0 million three-year senior secured revolving credit facility (the “credit agreement”) with Société Générale (“SocGen”), as administrative agent, SG Americas Securities, LLC (“SG Americas”), as lead arranger and bookrunner, and the Lenders signatory thereto (collectively with SocGen, the “Lender”).
  
 The initial borrowing base of the credit facility is $44.0 million, and is subject to redetermination on April 1st and October 1st of each year, as well as special redeterminations described in the credit agreement. The amounts borrowed under the credit agreement bear annual interest rates at either (a) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 3.00% to 4.00% or (b) the prime lending rate of SocGen plus 2.00% to 3.00%, depending on the amount borrowed under the credit facility and whether the loan is drawn in U.S. dollars or Euro dollars. Principal amounts outstanding under the credit facility are due and payable in full at maturity on October 26, 2019. All of the obligations under the credit agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all of our assets. Additional payments due under the credit agreement include paying a commitment fee to the Lender in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder. The commitment rate is 0.50% per year of the unutilized portion of the borrowing base in effect from time to time. We are also required to pay customary letter of credit fees.
  
 The credit agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make investments, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, pay dividends and distributions or repurchase our capital stock, engage in mergers or consolidations, sell certain assets, sell or discount any notes receivable or accounts receivable, and engage in certain transactions with affiliates.
  
 In addition, the credit agreement requires us to maintain the following financial covenants: a current ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0, a ratio of total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and exploration expenses (“EBITDAX”) ratio of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0, a ratio of EBITDAX to interest expense for the four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding such date of determination to be less than 2.75 to 1.0, and cash and cash equivalent investments together with borrowing availability under the credit agreement of at least $3 million. EBITDAX is defined in the credit agreement as, for any period, the sum of consolidated net income for such period plus the following expenses or charges to the extent deducted from consolidated net income in such period: interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, non-cash losses as a result of changes in fair market value of derivatives, oil and gas exploration and abandonment expenses, extraordinary or non-recurring losses, other non-cash charges reducing consolidated net income for such period, minus non-cash income included in consolidated net income and any extraordinary or non-recurring items increasing consolidated net income for such period. For fiscal quarters ending prior to and not including the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2017, EBITDAX will be calculated using an annualized EBITDAX and interest expense will be calculated using an annualized interest expense. Annualized EBITDAX is defined in the credit agreement as, (a) EBITDAX for the four-fiscal quarter period ending on December 31, 2016 will be deemed to equal EBITDAX for such fiscal quarter multiplied by four (4); (b) EBITDAX for the four-fiscal quarter period ending March 31, 2017 will be deemed to equal EBITDAX for the two-fiscal quarter period comprising the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2016 and the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2017, multiplied by two (2); and (c) EBITDAX for the four-fiscal quarter period ending June 30, 2017 will be deemed to equal EBITDAX for the three-fiscal quarter period comprising the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2016, the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2017 and the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2017, multiplied by four-thirds (4/3). Annualized interest expense is defined in the credit agreement as, (i) interest expense for the four-fiscal quarter period ending on December 31, 2016 will be deemed to equal interest expense for such fiscal quarter multiplied by four (4); (ii) interest expense for the four-fiscal quarter period ending March 31, 2017 will be deemed to equal interest expense for the two-fiscal quarter period comprising the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2016 and the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2017, multiplied by two (2); and (iii) interest expense for the four-fiscal quarter period ending June 30, 2017 will be deemed to equal interest expense for the three-fiscal quarter period comprising the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2016, the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2017 and the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2017, multiplied by four-thirds (4/3). The credit agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and defines events of default for credit facilities of this type, including failure to pay principal or interest, breach of covenants, breach of representations and warranties, insolvency, judgment default, and a change of control. Upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, the Lender has the right to accelerate repayment of the loans and exercise its remedies with respect to the collateral. See Part II, Item 8. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15 – Debt and Interest Expense.

  Preferred Stock
  
 On October 26, 2016 as part of the closing of the Davis Merger, we issued 1,754,179 shares of Series D preferred stock. The Series D preferred stock had an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $19.4 million and a conversion rate of $11.0741176 per share at the closing of the Davis Merger, and will be paid dividends in the form of additional shares of Series D preferred stock at a rate of 7% per annum.
 Operating Outlook
  
 Since 2014, the oil and natural gas industry has experienced significant decreases in commodity prices driven by supply and demand imbalances for oil internationally and for natural gas in the United States. The decline in commodity prices and global economic conditions have continued into 2017, and low commodity prices may exist for an extended period of time.
  
 We plan to continue our disciplined approach in 2017 by emphasizing liquidity and value, enhancing operational efficiencies, and managing capital expenses. We will continue to evaluate the oil and natural gas price environments and may adjust our capital spending plans, capital raising activities, and strategic alternatives (including possible asset sales) to maintain appropriate liquidity and financial flexibility.
  
  Business Strategy
 
 Due to the continued low commodity price environment and our belief that uncertainty remains with respect to commodity prices in 2017, we expect our capital spending plans to be limited to within our cash flow, which is expected to increase in 2017 as a result of the Davis Merger and a decrease in G&A costs on a per barrel basis. We will be focused on lower risk and lower cost opportunities that are expected to have higher returns to maintain our production and cash flow. In addition, we intend to capture new opportunities that will build inventory, not only in the Gulf Coast basins where we have considerable history and experience, but also in new areas and basins where we may have special knowledge, technical expertise, or a competitive advantage.
 
 The key elements of our business strategy are:
  
    ●
 seek merger, acquisition, and joint venture opportunities to increase our liquidity, as well as reduce our G&A on a per Boe basis;

 
    ●
 transition existing inventory of non-producing and undeveloped reserves into oil and natural gas production;

 
    ●
 add selectively to project inventory through ongoing prospect generation, exploration and strategic acquisitions; and

 
    ●
 retain a greater percentage working interest in, and operatorship of, our projects going forward.

 
 Our core competencies include oil and natural gas operating activities and expertise in generating and developing:
  
    ●
 unconventional oil and natural gas resource plays;

 
    ●
 onshore liquids-rich prospects through the use of 3-D seismic surveys; and

 
    ●
 identification of high impact deep onshore prospects located beneath known producing trends through the use of 3-D seismic surveys.

  Our Key Strengths and Competitive Advantages
  
 We believe the following are our key strengths and competitive advantages:
  
    ●
 Extensive technical knowledge and history of operations in the Gulf Coast region. We believe our extensive understanding of the geology and experience in interpreting well control, core and 3-D seismic data in this area provides us with a competitive advantage in exploring and developing projects in the Gulf Coast region. We have cultivated amicable and mutually beneficial relationships with acreage owners in this region and adjacent oil and natural gas operators, which generally provides for effective leasing and development activities.

 
    ●
 In-house technical expertise in 3-D seismic programs. We design and generate in-house 3-D seismic survey programs on many of our projects. By controlling the 3-D seismic program from field acquisition through seismic processing and interpretation, we gain a competitive advantage through proprietary knowledge of the project.

 
    ●
 Liquids-rich, quality assets with attractive economics. Our assets and potential future drilling locations are primarily in oil plays with associated liquids-rich natural gas.

 
    ●
 Diversified portfolio of producing and non-producing assets. Our current portfolio of producing and non-producing assets covers a large area within the Gulf Coast, south and east Texas, the Bakken/Three Forks shale in North Dakota, along with shallow oil fields in central and southern California.

 
    ●
 Company operated assets. In order to maintain better control over our assets, we have established a leasehold position comprised primarily of assets where we are the operator. By controlling operations, we are able to dictate the pace of development and better manage the cost, type, and timing of exploration and development activities.

 
    ●
 Experienced management team. We have a highly qualified management team with many years of industry experience, including extensive experience in the Louisiana and Texas Gulf Coast, south and east Texas, and most of the other oil and natural gas producing regions of the United States. Our exploration team has substantial expertise in the design, acquisition, processing and interpretation of 3-D seismic surveys, our experienced operations team allows for efficient turnaround from project identification, to drilling, to production, and our engineering and geoscience teams have considerable experience evaluating both conventional and unconventional opportunities in existing and prospective trends.

 
    ●
 Experienced board of directors. Our directors have substantial experience managing successful public companies and realizing value for investors through the development, acquisition and monetization of both conventional and unconventional oil and natural gas assets.

 
  Description of Major Properties
  
 We are the operator of properties containing approximately 60% of our proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2016. As operator, we are able to directly influence exploration, development and production operations. Our producing properties have reasonably predictable production profiles and cash flows, subject to commodity price fluctuations, and have provided a foundation for our technical staff to pursue the development of our undeveloped acreage, further develop our existing properties and also generate new projects that we believe have the potential to increase shareholder value.
  
 As is common in the industry, we participate in non-operated properties and investments on a selective basis; our non-operating participation decisions are dependent on the technical and economic nature of the projects and the operating expertise and financial standing of the operators. The following is a description of our significant oil and natural gas properties.

  South Louisiana
  
 We have operated and non-operated assets in many of the prolific oil and natural gas producing parishes of south Louisiana including Cameron, Jefferson Davis, LaFourche, Livingston, St. Helena, St. Bernard, and Vermilion parishes. As of December 31, 2016, we had working interests in fifteen fields in south Louisiana of which we operate nine with an average operated working interest of 67.5%. The acreage associated with these leasehold positions is comprised of 28,158 gross acres and 10,969 net acres. The associated assets produce from a variety of conventional formations with oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids from depths of approximately 5,500 feet to almost 19,000 feet. The formations include the Lower Miocene, CibCarst, Dibert, Wilcox, Marg Tex, Het 1A, Tuscaloosa, Miocene Siphonina, and Lower Planulina Cris R sands. This diversified mix of assets results in predictable and well-diversified production profiles. The collective production from this area averaged approximately 47 MMcf/d of natural gas and 2,062 Bbl/d of oil gross (9.6 MMcf/d and 554 Bbl/d net) during the month of December 2016. Our inventory of future development opportunities includes proved, probable and possible reserves and prospective resources consisting of behind pipe recompletions, artificial lift installations, workovers, sidetracks of existing wells and new well drilling opportunities.
  
 Our two largest fields in south Louisiana, based on estimated proved reserve value, are described below.
  
 Lac Blanc Field, Vermilion Parish, Louisiana – We are the operator of the Lac Blanc Field where we have a 62.5% working interest. The field is comprised of 1,744 gross acres and 1,090 net acres where two wells, the SL 18090 #1 and #2, are producing from the Miocene Siphonina D-1 sand (18,700 feet sand). The field averaged approximately 7.5 MMcf/d of natural gas and 127 Bbl/d of oil gross (3.3 MMcf/d and 56 Bbl/d net) during the month of December 2016.
  
 Bayou Hebert Field, Vermilion Parish, Louisiana – We have a 12.5% non-operated working interest in the Bayou Hebert Field, which is comprised of approximately 1,600 gross acres and 200 net acres with three wells completed in the Lower Planulina Cris R sands.  In mid-December 2016, the operator recompleted the lowest well on the structure, the Thibodeaux No. 1 well, from the Cris R “C” zone up hole to the Cris R “B” zone. Although the field was partially down while recompletion operations were underway, the field averaged approximately 33.9 MMcf/d of natural gas and 685 Bbl/d of oil gross (3.1 MMcf/d and 62 Bbl/d net) during the month of December 2016. Future development opportunities include behind pipe recompletions and sidetracking an existing wellbore for proved and non-proved reserves.
  
  Southeast Texas
  
 We have operated and non-operated assets in southeast Texas containing both conventional and unconventional properties located in Jefferson, Brazos and Madison counties. As of December 31, 2016, we had working interests in three fields, one of which we operated, with an average working interest of 47.4%. The average working interest in the two non-operated fields was approximately 14.4%. The acreage associated with these leasehold positions consist of 46,727 gross acres and 3,111 net acres. The unconventional assets are developed primarily with horizontal wells in the Eagle Ford and tight Woodbine sands producing oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids from depths of approximately 8,000 feet to 9,000 feet. Typical development wells are drilled horizontally with lateral sections ranging from approximately 4,500 feet to 7,500 feet in length where multi-stage fracturing technology is employed. Collective production from this area averaged approximately 7.0 MMcf/d of natural gas and 2,166 Bbl/d of oil gross (1.1 MMcf/d and 174 Bbl/d net) during the month of December 2016. Future development opportunities include the drilling of proved and non-proved reserves, the development of which will be influenced largely by future oil and natural gas commodities prices.
 California
  
 We have assets in Kern and Santa Barbara Counties in California. As of December 31, 2016, we have a 100% working interest in seven conventional fields with a leasehold position comprised of 1,342 gross acres inclusive of 263 fee or minerals only acres. These properties produce oil from a variety of conventional formations including the Pliocene, Miocene, Oligocene, and Eocene from depths ranging from approximately 800 feet to 6,300 feet and are characterized by long-life shallow decline production profiles. For the month ended December 31, 2016, production from our California assets averaged approximately 124 Bbls of oil per day gross (105 Bbl/d net). Future development opportunities include behind pipe recompletions, artificial lift installations, and new well drilling opportunities of proved and non-proved reserves.
  
   
8


  
 
  North Dakota
  
 We have non-operated working interests in the Bakken Play in McKenzie County, North Dakota. As of December 31, 2016, we had an approximate 5.2% average working interest in two fields that together include 18,553 gross acres and 706 net acres. Oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids are produced from depths of approximately 8,000 feet from wells drilled horizontally with lateral lengths ranging from approximately 5,000 feet to 10,000 feet and completed with multi-stage fracturing technology. For the month ended December 31, 2016, gross production from these assets averaged 234 Bbl/d of oil gross and 144 Mcf/d of natural gas (6 Bbl/d net and 4 Mcf/d). Future development opportunities include the drilling of non-proved reserves, the development of which will be influenced largely by future oil and natural gas commodities prices.
 Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
  
 All of our oil and natural gas reserves are located in the United States. Unaudited information concerning the estimated net quantities of all of our proved reserves and the standardized measure of future net cash flows from the reserves is presented in Note 24 – Supplementary Information on Oil and Natural Gas Exploration, Development and Production Activities (Unaudited) in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 in this report. The reserve estimates have been prepared by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”), an independent petroleum engineering firm. We have no long-term supply or similar agreements with foreign governments or authorities. We did not provide any reserve information to any federal agencies in 2016 other than to the SEC.
 Estimated Proved Reserves
  
 The table below summarizes our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016 based on reports prepared by NSAI. In preparing these reports, NSAI evaluated 100% of our properties at December 31, 2016. For more information regarding our independent reserve engineers, please see Independent Reserve Engineers below. The information in the following table does not give any effect to or reflect our commodity derivatives.

 Barrels of oil equivalent have been calculated on the basis of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of natural gas equal to one barrel of oil equivalent (Boe).

 
  (2)            
 Present Value Discounted at 10% (“PV10”) is a Non-GAAP measure that differs from the GAAP measure “standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows” in that PV10 is calculated without regard to future income taxes. Management believes that the presentation of the PV10 value is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the estimated discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated proved reserves independent of our income tax attributes, thereby isolating the intrinsic value of the estimated future cash flows attributable to our reserves. Because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure provides greater comparability of assets when evaluating companies. For these reasons, management uses, and believes the industry generally uses, the PV10 measure in evaluating and comparing acquisition candidates and assessing the potential return on investment related to investments in oil and natural gas properties. PV10 includes estimated abandonment costs less salvage. PV10 does not necessarily represent the fair market value of oil and natural gas properties.

 PV10 is not a measure of financial or operational performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP. For a presentation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, see Note 24 – Supplementary Information on Oil and Natural Gas Exploration, Development and Production Activities (Unaudited) in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 in this report. The table below titled “Non-GAAP Reconciliation” provides a reconciliation of PV10 to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.

 Proved reserves were calculated using prices equal to the twelve-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month prices for each of the preceding twelve months, which were $42.75 per Bbl (WTI) and $2.48 per MMBtu (HH), for the year ended December 31, 2016. Adjustments were made for location and grade.

 Our Lac Blanc Field and Bayou Hebert Field were our only fields that each contained 15% or more of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2016.

 
  Proved Undeveloped Reserves
  
 At December 31, 2016, our estimated proved undeveloped (“PUD”) reserves were approximately 1,404 MBoe. The following table details the changes in PUD reserves for the year ended December 31, 2016 (in MBoe):

Beginning proved undeveloped reserves at January 1, 2016 | 1,731 
---------------------------------------------------------+--------
Undeveloped reserves transferred to developed | (325) 
Purchases of minerals-in-place | 6,379 
Extensions and discoveries | 83 
Production | - 
Revisions | (6,464)
Proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2016 | 1,404 


 
 From January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, our PUD reserves decreased 327 MBoe, or 19%, from 1,731 MBoe to 1,404 MBoe. Reserves of 325 MBoe were moved from the PUD reserve category to the proved developed producing category through the drilling of the EE Broussard 1 Het 1 well in the Cameron Canal field. We incurred approximately $6.3 million in capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2016 in converting this well to the proved developed reserve category. We acquired 6,379 MBoe through purchases of minerals-in-place as a result of the Davis Merger, and added 83 MBoe through extensions of existing discoveries in our Kern County, California assets. The remaining change to our year-end 2016 PUDs of 6,464 MBoe was a result of downward revisions due to price of 70 MBoe, and downward revisions due to removing 6,394 MBoe of primarily Masters Creek Field undeveloped reserves. We elected not to extend our Masters Creek acreage associated with these reserves because of the depressed price environment and our inability to attract a joint venture partner. As of December 31, 2016, we plan to drill all of our PUD drilling locations within five years from the date they were initially recorded.
  
 Uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many risk factors beyond our control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating subsurface accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and the interpretation thereof. As a result, estimates by different engineers often vary, sometimes significantly. In addition, physical factors such as the results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimates, as well as economic factors such as change in product prices, may require revision of such estimates. Accordingly, oil and natural gas quantities ultimately recovered will vary from reserve estimates.

  Technology Used to Establish Reserves
  
 Under SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs, under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proven effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
  
 To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, NSAI employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our reserves include, but are not limited to, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, geologic maps and available downhole and production data, seismic data and well test data. Reserves attributable to producing wells with sufficient production history were estimated using appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. Reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history and for undeveloped locations were estimated using both volumetric estimates and performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area. These wells were considered to be analogous based on production performance from the same formation and completion using similar techniques.
  
  Independent Reserve Engineers
  
 We engaged NSAI to prepare our annual reserve estimates and have relied on NSAI’s expertise to ensure that our reserve estimates are prepared in compliance with SEC guidelines.

  Internal Control over Preparation of Reserve Estimates
  
 We maintain adequate and effective internal controls over our reserve estimation process as well as the underlying data upon which reserve estimates are based. The primary inputs to the reserve estimation process are technical information, financial data, ownership interest, and production data. The relevant field and reservoir technical information, which is updated annually, is assessed for validity when our independent petroleum engineering firm has technical meetings with our engineers, geologists, and operations and land personnel. Current revenue and expense information is obtained from our accounting records, which are subject to external quarterly reviews, annual audits and our own set of internal controls over financial reporting. All current financial data such as commodity prices, lease operating expenses, production taxes and field-level commodity price differentials are updated in the reserve database and then analyzed to ensure that they have been entered accurately and that all updates are complete. Our current ownership in mineral interests and well production data are also subject to our internal controls over financial reporting, and they are incorporated in our reserve database as well and verified internally by us to ensure their accuracy and completeness. Once the reserve database has been updated with current information, and the relevant technical support material has been assembled, our independent engineering firm meets with our technical personnel to review field performance and future development plans in order to further verify the validity of estimates. Following these reviews, the reserve database is furnished to NSAI so that it can prepare its independent reserve estimates and final report. The reserve estimates prepared by NSAI are reviewed and compared to our internal estimates by our Chief Operating Officer and our reservoir engineering staff. Material reserve estimation differences are reviewed between NSAI’s reserve estimates and our internally prepared reserves on a case-by-case basis. An iterative process is performed between NSAI and us, and additional data is provided to address any differences. If the supporting documentation will not justify additional changes, the NSAI reserves are accepted. In the event that additional data supports a reserve estimation adjustment, NSAI will analyze the additional data, and may make changes it deems necessary. Additional data is usually comprised of updated production information on new wells. Once the review is completed and all material differences are reconciled, the reserve report is finalized and our reserve database is updated with the final estimates provided by NSAI. Access to our reserve database is restricted to specific members of our reservoir engineering department and management.

  Gross and Net Productive Wells
  
 As of December 31, 2016, our total gross and net productive wells were as follows:
  

 
Oil (1) | Natural Gas (1) | Total (1)
---------+-----------------+----------
Gross | Net | Gross | Net | Gross | Net 
Wells | Wells | Wells | Wells | Wells | Wells
207 | 118 | 58 | 8 | 265 | 126 


 
  (1) 
 A gross well is a well in which a working interest is owned. The number of net wells represents the sum of fractions of working interests we own in gross wells. Productive wells are producing wells plus shut-in wells we deem capable of production. Horizontal re-entries of existing wells do not increase a well total above one gross well. We have working interests in 10 gross wells with completions into more than one productive zone; in the table above, these wells with multiple completions are only counted as one gross well.

 
  Gross and Net Developed and Undeveloped Acres
  
 As of December 31, 2016, we had total gross and net developed and undeveloped leasehold acres as set forth below. The developed acreage is stated on the basis of spacing units designated or permitted by state regulatory authorities. Gross acres are those acres in which a working interest is owned. The number of net acres represents the sum of fractional working interests we own in gross acres.

 | Developed | Undeveloped | Total 
-------------+-----------+-------------+-------
State | Gross | Net | Gross | Net | Gross | Net 
Louisiana | 20,023 | 3,833 | 8,135 | 7,136 | 28,158 | 10,969
North Dakota | 18,553 | 706 | - | - | 18,553 | 706 
Texas | 43,710 | 2,756 | 3,017 | 355 | 46,727 | 3,111 
Oklahoma | 2,000 | 79 | - | - | 2,000 | 79 
California | 1,342 | 1,342 | - | - | 1,342 | 1,342 
Wyoming | 7,360 | 3 | - | - | 7,360 | 3 
Total | 92,988 | 8,719 | 11,152 | 7,491 | 104,140 | 16,210


 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had leases representing 7,436 net acres (none of which were in the Lac Blanc or Bayou Herbert Fields) expiring in 2017; 55 net acres (none of which were in the Lac Blanc or Bayou Herbert Fields) expiring in 2018; and -0- net acres expiring in 2019 and beyond. We believe that our current and future drilling plans, along with selected lease extensions, can address the majority of the leases expiring in 2017 and beyond.
  
  Exploratory Wells and Development Wells
  
 Set forth below for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is information concerning our drilling activity during the years indicated.
  

 
 | Net Exploratory | Net Developement | Total Net Productive

 | Wells Drilled | Wells Drilled | and Dry Wells 
Year | Productive | Dry | Productive | Dry | Drilled
2016 | - | - | 1.0 | - | 1.0 
2015 | 0.3 | - | 0.2 | - | 0.5 

 Present Activities
  
 At April 12, 2017, we had -0- gross (-0- net) wells in the process of drilling or completing.

  Supply Contracts or Agreements
  
 Crude oil and condensate are sold through month-to-month evergreen contracts. The price is tied to an index or a weighted monthly average of posted prices with certain adjustments for gravity, Basic Sediment and Water (“BS&W”) and transportation. Generally, the index or posting is based on WTI and adjusted to LLS or HLS. Pricing for our California properties is based on an average of specified posted prices, adjusted for gravity, transportation, and for one field, a market differential.
  
 Our natural gas is sold under multi-year contracts with pricing tied to either first of the month index or a monthly weighted average of purchaser prices received. Natural gas liquids are also sold under multi-year contacts usually tied to the related natural gas contract. Pricing is based on published prices for each product or a monthly weighted average of purchaser prices received.
  
 We also engage in hedging activities as discussed below in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Hedging Activities.”
  
  Competition
  
 The domestic oil and natural gas business is intensely competitive in the exploration for and acquisition of leasehold interests, reserves and in the producing and marketing of oil and natural gas production. Our competitors include national oil companies, major oil and natural gas companies, independent oil and natural gas companies, drilling partnership programs, individual producers, natural gas marketers, and major pipeline companies, as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies. They likely are able to pay more for seismic information and lease rights on oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate oil and gas related transactions in a highly competitive environment.
 Other Business Matters
  
  Major Customers
  
 During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, sales to five customers accounted for approximately 78% and sales to four customers accounted for approximately 84%, respectively, of the Company’s total revenues.
  
 We believe there are adequate alternate purchasers of our production such that the loss of one or more of the above purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.
  
  Seasonality of Business
  
 Weather conditions affect the demand for, and prices of, natural gas and can also delay oil and natural gas drilling activities, disrupting our overall business plans. Demand for natural gas is typically higher during the winter, resulting in higher natural gas prices for our natural gas production during our first and fourth fiscal quarters. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, our results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that we may realize on an annual basis.
 Operational Risks
  
 Oil and natural gas exploration and development involves a high degree of risk, which even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. There is no assurance that we will discover or acquire additional oil and natural gas in commercial quantities. Oil and natural gas operations also involve the risk that well fires, blowouts, equipment failure, human error and other events may cause accidental leakage or spills of toxic or hazardous materials, such as petroleum liquids or drilling fluids into the environment, or cause significant injury to persons or property. In such event, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the satisfaction of which could substantially reduce our available cash and possibly result in loss of oil and natural gas properties. Such hazards may also cause damage to or destruction of wells, producing formations, production facilities and pipeline or other processing facilities.
  
   
15


  
 
 As is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we do not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows. For further discussion of these risks see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this report.
  
  Title to Properties
  
 We believe that the title to our oil and natural gas properties is good and defensible in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry, subject to such exceptions which, in our belief, are not so material as to detract substantially from the use or value of such properties. Our properties are typically subject to, in one degree or another, one or more of the following:
  
   ●
 royalties and other burdens and obligations, express or implied, under oil and natural gas leases;

 
   ●
 overriding royalties and other burdens created by us or our predecessors in title;

 
   ●
 a variety of contractual obligations (including, in some cases, development obligations) arising under operating agreements, farmout agreements, production sales contracts and other agreements that may affect the properties or their titles;

 
   ●
 back-ins and reversionary interests existing under purchase agreements and leasehold assignments;

 
   ●
 liens that arise in the normal course of operations, such as those for unpaid taxes, statutory liens securing obligations to unpaid suppliers and contractors and contractual liens under operating agreements, as well as pooling, unitization and communitization agreements, declarations and orders; and

 
   ●
 easements, restrictions, rights-of-way and other matters that commonly affect property.

 
 To the extent that such burdens and obligations affect our rights to production revenues, they have been taken into account in calculating our net revenue interests and in estimating the size and value of our reserves. We believe that the burdens and obligations affecting our properties are conventional in the industry for properties of the kind that we own.
  
  Regulations
  
 All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the plugging and abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in an area, and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, as well as regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from fields and individual wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern the size of drilling and spacing units, the density of wells that may be drilled in oil and natural gas properties and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of land and leases to facilitate exploration while other states rely primarily or exclusively on voluntary pooling of land and leases. In areas where pooling is primarily or exclusively voluntary, it may be difficult to form spacing units and therefore difficult to develop a project if the operator owns less than 100% of the leasehold. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose specified requirements regarding the ratability of production. On some occasions, local authorities have imposed moratoria or other restrictions on exploration and production activities pending investigations and studies addressing potential local impacts of these activities before allowing oil and natural gas exploration and production to proceed.
  
   
16


  
 
 The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction.
  
  Environmental Regulations
  
 Our operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency, commonly referred to as the EPA, issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures. Among other things, environmental regulatory programs typically govern the permitting, construction and operation of a well or production related facility. Many factors, including public perception, can materially impact the ability to secure an environmental construction or operation permit. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities. In addition, some laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, which could result in liability for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on our part.
  
 Beyond existing requirements, new programs and changes in existing programs, may address various aspects of our business including oil and natural gas exploration and production, air emissions, waste management, and underground injection of waste material. Environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance in the future may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position.
  
  Hazardous Substances and Wastes
  
 The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, referred to as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons may include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances that have been released at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of some health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment.
  
 Under the federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, referred to as RCRA, most wastes generated by the exploration and production of oil and natural gas are not regulated as hazardous waste. Periodically, however, there are proposals to lift the existing exemption for oil and natural gas wastes and reclassify them as hazardous wastes or subject them to enhanced solid waste regulation. If such proposals were to be enacted, they could have a significant impact on our operating costs and on those of all the industry in general. In the ordinary course of our operations moreover, some wastes generated in connection with our exploration and production activities may be regulated as solid waste under RCRA, as hazardous waste under existing RCRA regulations or as hazardous substances under CERCLA. From time to time, releases of materials or wastes have occurred at locations we own or at which we have operations. These properties and the materials or wastes released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we have been and may be required to remove or remediate such materials or wastes.
  
   
17


  
 
  Water Discharges
  
 Our operations are also subject to the federal Clean Water Act and analogous state laws. Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA has adopted regulations concerning discharges of storm water runoff. This program requires covered facilities to obtain individual permits, or seek coverage under a general permit. Some of our properties may require permits for discharges of storm water runoff. We believe that we will be able to obtain, or be included under, these permits, where necessary, and make minor modifications to existing facilities and operations that would not have a material effect on us. The Clean Water Act and similar state acts regulate other discharges of wastewater, oil, and other pollutants to surface water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, wetlands, and streams. Failure to obtain permits for such discharges could result in civil and criminal penalties, orders to cease such discharges, and costs to remediate and pay natural resources damages. These laws also require the preparation and implementation of Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure Plans in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. In the event of a discharge of oil into U.S. waters, we could be liable under the Oil Pollution Act for clean-up costs, damages and economic losses.
  
 Our oil and natural gas production also generates salt water, which we dispose of by underground injection. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) regulations promulgated under the SDWA and related state programs regulate the drilling and operation of salt water disposal wells. The EPA directly administers the UIC program in some states, and in others it is delegated to the state for administering. Permits must be obtained before drilling salt water disposal wells, and casing integrity monitoring must be conducted periodically to ensure the casing is not leaking salt water to groundwater. Contamination of groundwater by oil and natural gas drilling, production, and related operations may result in fines, penalties, and remediation costs, among other sanctions and liabilities under the SDWA and state laws. In addition, third party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury.
  
  Hydraulic Fracturing
  
 Our completion operations are subject to regulation, which may increase in the short- or long-term. In particular, the well completion technique known as hydraulic fracturing, which is used to stimulate production of natural gas and oil, has come under increased scrutiny by the environmental community and many local, state and federal regulators. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and additives under pressure, usually down casing that is cemented in the wellbore, into prospective rock formations at depth to stimulate oil and natural gas production. We engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us in connection with substantially all of the wells for which we are the operator.
  
 Under the direction of Congress, the EPA completed a study finding that hydraulic fracturing could potentially harm drinking water resources under adverse circumstances such as injection directly into groundwater or into production wells lacking mechanical integrity. The EPA has also finalized pre-treatment standards under the Clean Water Act for wastewater discharges from shale hydraulic fracturing operations to municipal sewage treatment plants. Beyond that, several environmental groups have petitioned the EPA to extend toxic release reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act to the oil and natural gas extraction industry and to require disclosure under the Toxic Substances Control Act of chemicals used in fracturing. Congress might likewise consider legislation to amend the federal SDWA to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and natural gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process. Certain states, including Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, already have issued similar disclosure rules.
  
 In addition, the Department of the Interior has promulgated regulations concerning the use of hydraulic fracturing on lands under its jurisdiction, which includes lands on which we conduct or plan to conduct operations. States similarly have been imposing new restrictions or bans on hydraulic fracturing. Even local jurisdictions have adopted, or tried to adopt, regulations restricting hydraulic fracturing. Additional hydraulic fracturing requirements at the federal, state or local level may limit our ability to operate or increase our operating costs.
  
   
18


  
 
  Air Emissions
  
 The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources, including oil and natural gas production. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. Our operations, or the operations of service companies engaged by us, may in certain circumstances and locations be subject to permits and restrictions under these statutes for emissions of air pollutants.
  
 In 2012 and 2016, the EPA issued air regulations for the oil and natural gas industry that address emissions from certain new sources of volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”), sulfur dioxide, air toxics and methane. The rules include the first federal air standards for oil and natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured, or refractured, as well as requirements for other processes and equipment, including storage tanks. Compliance with these regulations has imposed additional requirements and costs on our operations. The EPA also has started to consider whether to extend such regulations to existing wells.
  
 In October 2015, the EPA announced that it was lowering the primary national ambient air quality standards (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion. Implementation will take place over several years; however, the new standard could result in a significant expansion of ozone nonattainment areas across the United States, including areas in which we operate. Oil and natural gas operations in ozone nonattainment areas would likely be subject to increased regulatory burdens in the form of more stringent emission controls, emission offset requirements, and increased permitting delays and costs.
  
  Climate Change
  
 Studies over recent years have indicated that emissions of certain gases may be contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere. In response to these studies, governments have been adopting domestic and international climate change regulations that require reporting and reductions of the emission of such greenhouse gases. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, are considered greenhouse gases. Internationally, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement address greenhouse gas emissions, and several countries, including those comprising the European Union, have established greenhouse gas regulatory systems. In the United States, at the state level, many states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have been implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through emission inventories, emissions targets, greenhouse gas cap and trade programs or incentives for renewable energy generation, while others have considered adopting such greenhouse gas programs.
  
 At the federal level, the EPA has issued regulations requiring us and other companies to annually report certain greenhouse gas emissions from our oil and natural gas facilities. Beyond its measuring and reporting rules, the EPA has issued an “Endangerment Finding” under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, concluding greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations. The finding served as the first step to issuing regulations that require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities.
  
 In addition, the Obama Administration developed a Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions that was intended to result by 2025 in a 40-45% decrease in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry as compared to 2012 levels. Consistent with that strategy, the EPA issued its air rules for oil and natural gas production sources, and the federal Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) promulgated standards for reducing venting and flaring on public lands.
  
 Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur additional operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems or other compliance costs, and reduce demand for our products.
  
   
19


  
 
  The National Environmental Policy Act
  
 Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities may be subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. This process has the potential to delay the development of future oil and natural gas projects.
  
  Threatened and endangered species, migratory birds and natural resources
  
 Various state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds, wetlands, and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Clean Water Act. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions on federal land use or on private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Where takings of or harm to species or damages to wetlands, habitat, or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or at times private parties may act to prevent or restrict oil and natural gas exploration activities or seek damages for any injury, whether resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and in some cases, criminal penalties may result. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to make a determination on listing of more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the ESA by no later than completion of the agency’s 2017 fiscal year. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The federal government in the past has issued indictments under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to several oil and natural gas companies after dead migratory birds were found near reserve pits associated with drilling activities. The identification or designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our development activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could adversely impact the value of our leases.
