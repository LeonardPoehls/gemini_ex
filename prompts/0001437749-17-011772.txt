ITEM 1. Business
OVERVIEW
 
The Salon Media Group is a technology-based advertising media business that wholly owns and operates an online news website called salon.com (“Salon.com”) that is committed to fearless journalism.  Our award-winning journalism combines original investigative stories and provocative personal essays along with quick-take commentary, articles, podcasts, and original video about politics, culture, entertainment, sustainability, innovation, technology and business.
 
Salon was originally incorporated in July 1995 in the State of California and reincorporated in Delaware in June 1999. In 1999, we had our initial public offering. In 2001, we adopted the name Salon Media Group, Inc. Our common stock is traded in the over-the-counter market and our stock symbol is SLNM.PK. 
 
Highlights from Fiscal Year 2017
 
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 (“fiscal year 2017”), we continued to execute our business strategy (see “Salon Strategy” below) to refine and broaden our editorial products in order to attract a premier audience that should attract more advertising, and increase our revenues. Our focus on high quality editorial attracted a continued robust audience to our Website in fiscal year 2017. However, we faced increased competition from both new and larger websites for online advertising campaigns, while industry trends continued a shift toward increased use of agency and software-based approaches to buying online advertising. As a result, we have re-focused our advertising sales to rely on the rapidly growing programmatic advertising business where we directly sell audience packages based on real time advertising demand as well as engaging third-party agencies to sell ads on our Website through programmatic advertising open marketplaces, and placed less emphasis on a traditional media sales effort. The highlights of our fiscal year 2017 are listed below: 

● | In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, our financial results continued to be impacted by industry trends that have prevailed over the past year; direct advertising revenue continued to decline and software-based “programmatic” advertising sales and video advertising products have dominated the digital advertising landscape. As a result of the continued decline in direct advertising, our total revenue in the fiscal year 2017 decreased 34% to $4.6 million. Following the market trend, 84% of our advertising revenue in fiscal year 2017 was generated by programmatic selling, and 16% by our direct sales team which focused mostly on high impact and higher cost-per-thousand-impression (“CPM”) custom video advertising. We have been making changes to our infrastructure to capture the greater programmatic opportunity for our display and video advertising inventory, and will continue to focus our efforts to allow better management of our advertising inventory and targeting for our advertisers. This has allowed us to improve our CPMs from our programmatic advertising by 25% in the March 2017 quarter as compared to the March 2016 quarter. However, the higher programmatic CPMs were offset by a decline in traffic from the same period last year, which led to a smaller inventory of ad products to sell, and a decline in revenues.

● | Net loss for the fiscal year 2017 was $10.4 million, a 432% increase from $2.0 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 (“fiscal year 2016.”) The increase in net loss was mainly attributed to a $5.6 million increase in non-cash interest expense from the prior year and an approximate $0.9 million in non-cash preferred deemed dividends, both recorded for the beneficial conversion feature of capital raising transactions during the fiscal year 2017. Operating expenses of $8.5 million for the fiscal year 2017 decreased 4% from the prior year.

● | We have continued to roll out our strategy to produce original video content focused on news, politics, and entertainment under the banner of “Salon Talks.” Our goal is to add high quality diversified content to our Website, and to attract premium video advertising that commands higher CPMs as compared to display advertising. We achieved nearly 30 million video views in the December 2016 quarter, and about 15 million in the March 2017 quarter, a short-term decline as we shifted our video technology to allow better monetization of these video view with high CPM pre-roll advertising. As a result of our efforts, we received positive critical acclaim as we were selected as a finalist for Magazine Industry Newsletter’s (“min”) 2016 Best of the Web Awards in the category of Scripted/Unscripted Video or Series for our Salon Talk video series, and again in min’s 2017 Magazine Media Awards for Video Excellence - original video.

● | Our focus on growing traffic has shifted from volume to quality, in order to maximize our ability to monetize our page views with higher CPM video and display advertising. Average monthly unique visitors to the Salon.com Website during the fiscal year 2017 was 12.7 million, compared to the average number of monthly users in fiscal year 2016 of 16.6 million, which is a decrease of 23%. We attribute the decline primarily to the changes in the algorithms used by Facebook to promote news content, which led to lower referral traffic from Facebook. We also had a decline in referral traffic from major sites like Yahoo and Twitter, and implemented software to remove non-human traffic, which also contributed to the decline. The traffic low point during the fiscal year 2017 was the month of September 2016, when the site attracted 9.6 million unique visitors and 28.6 million page views. Since September 2016, we have returned to growth, with Google referrals in the six months to March 2017 increasing 21%, Facebook referrals increasing 17% and unique visitors increasing 8%.

● | We continued collective bargaining with the Writers Guild of America, East, Inc. (“WGAE”) during the year. As we do not yet have an agreement with our union employees, we remain uncertain how it will impact our financial status, or if it will have a negative impact on our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary.

● | We were proud to be honored for our excellence in journalism during the fiscal year. In April 2017, Salon was named an honoree for the 2016 Webby Awards for its Online Film & Video, Video Remixes and Mashups category, for our Donald Trump/Big Lebowski mashup. We received further positive critical recognition for our video as we were selected as a finalist for min’s 2016 Best of the Web Awards in the category of scripted/unscripted video or series for our Salon Talks video series, and again in min’s 2017 Magazine Media Awards for Video Excellence - original video. Life essay contributor Susan Shapiro won an American Society for Journalists and Authors award for her 2016 Yom Kippur essay, “The Foregiveness Tour.” And, we are proud that our Editor-at-Large, D. Watkins has collaborated on the new season of the podcast “Undisclosed” which dives into the case of Freddie Gray and the Baltimore police.

● | Mobile users accounted for 60% of all users as of March 2017, which is down slightly from 62% at March 2016. We continue to have a company-wide focus on our users’ mobile needs, especially quick and easy access to fast-loading content optimized for better readability on smaller screens. We also have increased focus on monetization of mobile traffic through implementation of native and other mobile-optimized advertising.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Social media continues to be a major source of referral traffic, at approximately 27.6% of Website visitors as of March 31, 2017, and a significant focus across the Company. We make regular updates to the Website to optimize content to be shared on social media with a special focus on our mobile platforms. In March 2017, we had approximately 965,000 Facebook “likes,” and 953,000 Twitter followers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We restructured our advertising team during the fiscal year to focus our efforts on programmatic advertising, while continuing to pursue on a selective basis high value direct campaigns that incorporate custom creative applications, pre-roll video advertising and seamless video integrations. As a result of changes we have made to the composition of our sales team, we have added expertise in programmatic marketplaces that should allow us to optimize the sale of our advertising inventory.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We continually work toward leaner, more efficient technological systems through automation, improved architecture and adoption of emerging best practices. Throughout the year, we began a process to redesign our Website, made technological updates to our browser, tablet, mobile, and watch platforms with a focus on video, mobile and advertising and ad blocking.

Salon Strategy 
 
In May 2016, we adopted a new strategy alongside the appointment of Jordan Hoffner as Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). Our strategy focuses on improving monetization of our user base by innovating our ad technology in order to better match our highly educated and affluent users with advertisers. In the past few years, we have successfully attracted a sizeable user base, which in fiscal year 2017 averaged 12.7 million users per month who consumed an average of 35.5 million page views per month. Our number of page views translates to our number of viewer impressions that can be sold to our advertisers, and offers opportunities to develop business relationships with companies that want access to our attractive user base. We currently sell our impressions to advertisers programmatically based on Run of Site private marketplaces, or at times, based on editorial content that falls in a particular vertical such as “Movies” or “Innovation.” The CPM is driven by market demand for our content, and the general demographics of our audience. Going forward, the CPM that we can charge our advertisers will increasingly be based on our ability to deliver highly targeted and defined users to our advertiser, and we expect to achieve higher CPMs as we can deliver more detailed information about our users. 
 
Our strategy is predicated on the following core principles: (1) create high quality diversified content that meets our users’ and advertisers’ interests; (2) hire the best possible talent to create centers of excellence and (3) innovate to bring great products to our users and advertisers. Our focus on these core principles underpins our goal to continue to grow our user base, and to develop new strategies around Website monetization that will provide opportunity for future growth.

In fiscal year 2018, our goal is to continue our mission of creating fearless journalism and making the conversation smarter, while anticipating continued shifts in the online advertising market to better monetize our Website. To reach our goals, and to achieve profitability, we will push ahead in the following areas:
 

● | Develop a broader mix of provocative content in addition to the core areas of news and politics, building off the original definition of a “salon” as a center of intellectual discussion
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Deepen our editorial coverage by adopting a broader array of story-telling methods, such as continuing to expand our video content, audio podcasts and other visual products, with an unwavering commitment to high quality content and fearless journalism
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Integrate into our advertising approach a deeper focus on new advertising products that match our high-quality user with appropriate advertisers using data and innovative ad products
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Develop a Broader Mix of Provocative Content
 
We target an educated, culturally engaged audience interested in original thinking and smart commentary. We pursue that audience by featuring a diverse array of voices and perspectives, and covering a wide range of topics including News, Politics, Business, Technology, Life, Entertainment, Sustainability and Innovation. Twenty-four hours a day, 365 days per year, Salon invites users to immerse themselves in thought-provoking content that impassions and empowers them to be the intellectual and cultural leaders of our time.
 
In fiscal year 2017, we continued to expand our breaking news coverage with a focus on the 2016 Presidential Election. Using data analytics in real-time, we can assess where our users’ interests are shifting, and respond by determining content, site layout and structure to best suit their needs in the moment. In fiscal year 2018, we intend to respond to users’ interests by hosting more dynamic content, such as increased numbers of video, slideshows and images, as well as by expanding further into content areas such as innovation and lifestyle. We will expand into new content areas by reallocating internal resources, as well as continue to have content partnerships to diversify our content offerings across various verticals.

As we continue to focus our editorial to our users’ needs, we seek to grow unique visitors to our Website since the resulting page views serve as a platform for advertising impressions, a key driver of our revenue growth.
 
Develop Innovative, User-Oriented Products
 
We continually need fresh content and new ideas to attract readers to our Website. We plan to continue to focus on developing our audience through a combination of editorial enhancements, increased dynamic content and new user-focused functionalities and products. We are continually evaluating the needs of our users and trying to adjust and create new solutions to meet their needs. 

Video is popular with our users, and as a result in fiscal year 2017 we continued to develop more Salon-branded video content. In fiscal year 2018, in order to achieve widespread video integration, we have expanded our video editorial team, and will trial partnerships to gain access to premium video content, and implement new technology to improve viewability. Video is in high demand with our advertisers. In fiscal year 2017, we took initial steps to monetize our original video with pre-roll programmatic and direct advertising campaigns. We plan to expand the monetization of video through improved technology, wider advertising demand sources, and premium video ad products.

Web browsers and applications on mobile platforms are a significant area of audience growth and ad revenue in the online news industry, in particular as social media users have increasingly adopted usage on their mobile phones. Our users continue to move to mobile at record rates, and as of March 2017, mobile browsers accounted for 60%, of our unique visitors. Social media has also become a key driver of users for us, consistent with trends for other online news sites. The importance in Website traffic from social media was underpinned by the significant increases in the number of Facebook “likes” to more than 965,000, and Twitter followers to 953,000. Although social media traffic can be variable due to changes in their approach to news content, the large number of “likes” and “followers” ensures that Salon content is pushed out to a large audience of readers on a daily basis. In fiscal year 2018, we plan to continue our efforts to build our audience on social media, and place more emphasis on other emerging platforms, through a continuation of the strategies we have employed in the past two years.

In fiscal year 2018, we are working on a Website and advertising architecture redesign aimed at improving the user experience. As part of this effort, we will continue exploring new products that meet the immediate needs of our mobile users, building out new advertising products for video and mobile and improving our security and scaling capabilities.
 
A Deeper Focus on New Advertising Products that Match our User with Appropriate Advertisers 
 
In order to expand our base of advertisers and increase our advertising revenues, we plan to integrate into our advertising approach a deeper focus on new advertising products that match our high-quality user with appropriate advertisers using data and innovative ad products. This includes adding software and data capabilities to understand our users better and match their interests with advertisers more closely. Once these mechanisms are fully in place, we plan to leverage our capabilities beyond Salon.com.
Path to Profitability
 
Our operating losses in fiscal year 2017 increased compared to fiscal year 2016 despite continued attempts to make adjustments to our revenue model in order to increase advertising revenues. Due to an industry shift in advertising dollars toward programmatic and video advertising, and a decline in traffic during the year, our direct advertising declined 71% and programmatic advertising decreased 26% leading to total advertising revenues decreasing 41% in fiscal year 2017. At the same time, our production costs remained constant from a year ago, which resulted in higher losses. 
 
Entering fiscal year 2018, we plan to build off of the progress we made in increasing CPMs in our advertising through programmatic marketplaces, and take advantage of an active news cycle to increase our page views and video views. We will also further increase our popular video products, to optimize the higher CPMs achieved by pre-roll advertising. Furthermore, in April 2017, we took steps to reduce further our expense base and shift resources to content that will generate higher CPM advertising. Given these changes, we anticipate that fiscal year 2018 will better align production costs with our revenue potential in an effort to reach profitability.
 

OUR BUSINESS
 
We target an educated, culturally engaged audience interested in original thinking and reporting on the day’s big stories. We pursue that audience by featuring a diverse array of voices and perspectives, and covering a wide range of topics including politics, race, religion, culture, entertainment, sustainability, innovation, technology and business.

Revenue Sources
 
Advertising is our primary source of revenue. Internet advertising revenues accounted for 78% of revenues in fiscal year 2017. Revenue from referring users to third party websites primarily accounted for the remainder 22% of revenues in fiscal year 2017.
 
Internet advertising is affected by broad economic conditions, like other forms of advertising, but overall it has continued its upward trend even through the Great Recession. According to the 2016 IAB Internet Advertising Revenue Report conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) over the past ten years for Internet advertising in the United States was 16%, which has significantly outpaced the U.S. current dollar GDP growth of 3% over the same period. Furthermore, since 2012, Internet advertising growth was fueled by an 87% CAGR in mobile, compared to a 6% growth in non-mobile revenues. Internet advertising revenue in the United States totaled $72.5 billion in 2016, a 21.8% increase from $59.6 billion 2015. In the quarter ended December 2016, the sources for advertising revenues were non-mobile search (22%), mobile (including search, display and video formats) (53%), non-mobile display advertising (19%) and other (including classifieds, lead generation and other unspecified) (6%). Notably, mobile advertising grew 68% in 2016, jumping to the largest ad format. Within the non-mobile display advertising segment, banner ads accounted for 12% and digital video accounted for 7% of advertising revenues. Also, according to an eMarketer report from April 2017, U.S. based programmatic advertising spending will be over $32.5 billion, a 27% increase from $25.5 billion in 2016. 
 
The bulk of online advertising remains concentrated in a relatively small number of dominant Internet companies, with the top ten companies accounting for 73% of online advertising in the December 2016 quarter, and another 10% captured by the next tier of companies ranked 11th through 25th. Therefore, we believe our market opportunity falls roughly at 17% of the online advertising market, or $12.3 billion.
 
The primary factor in our ability to increase our advertising revenues in future periods is growth in our audience. Attracting more unique visitors to our Website is important because these users generate additional page views, and each page view becomes a potential platform for advertisements. Advertising comprises video, banners, rich media, and other interactive ads across our desktop, tablet, mobile browser and apps platforms. Advertisers pay for advertising based on a CPM, and different platforms attract different CPMs. CPMs for mobile have been less than for desktop. Videos and sponsored content on mobile devices continue to grow in popularity and can demand a higher CPM. We believe that continuing to add videos and sponsored content to our mobile platform and improving and optimizing the platform’s design will help increase revenues from our mobile platform.

Overall, monthly unique visitors to our Website have grown from 6.3 million in March 31, 2011 to a peak of 19.6 million in June 30, 2015, and has reverted to 10.4 million in March 31, 2017. Our full year average monthly unique visitors were 5.4 million, 6.4 million, 10.6 million, 11.2 million, 16.9 million, 16.6 million and 12.7 million in fiscal years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. These fluctuations overall reflect changes in content areas on our Website over this period, improved search engine optimization, and adjustments in social media algorithms. The table below reflects unique monthly visitors to our Website from fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2017. Unique visitors in the period from March 2011 to May 2013 included traffic to an affiliated website that has since been shut down.

Sales and Marketing
 
As a news and lifestyle Website that competes against much larger websites, we have sought to distinguish ourselves in the marketplace by offering customized, innovative and integrated advertising products that appeal to users and seamlessly and organically incorporate our advertising clients and their objectives into our Website. We work with our programmatic advertising partners to launch advertisements that match our high-quality audience, and innovate with new products as they become available.
 
Our sales and marketing office is located in both San Francisco and New York, with three advertising sales and operations employees who actively solicit orders as of March 31, 2017.
 
Product Development 
 
We recognize that users come to the site for online news, reporting, opinion and an engaging, active community of writers, users and commenters. Users engage with the site through desktop computers, mobile phones and social networking platforms and other referral partners. To meet users’ rapidly evolving online media needs, we are continually innovating and developing our Website, mobile Website and social media presence – by adding new features, design updates and technologies that improve the user experience, speed and search engine optimization.

In fiscal year 2016, we worked on a Website redesign focused primarily on our article pages, aimed at improving our users’ experience. As part of this effort, we continued building out new advertising products for video and mobile, expanded our social media integration, improved our security and scaling capabilities, and explored new products that meet the immediate needs of our mobile users. 
 
In fiscal year 2017, we launched a Website redesign that will put in place a publishing infrastructure that can better take advantage of current technologies. The redesign will allow a better user experience as a result of quicker load time, and improved re-circulation of Salon content on each page, and improved monetization due to improved viewability of ads on our website. As a part of this redesign, we will continue to build new products for video and mobile, expand our social media integration, and improve security and scaling capabilities. 
 
Competition
 
The bulk of online advertising remains concentrated in a relatively small number of dominant Internet companies, with the top ten companies accounting for 73% of online advertising in the December 2016 quarter, and another 10% captured by the next tier of companies ranked 11th through 25th. Therefore, we believe our market opportunity falls roughly at 17% of the online advertising market, or $12.3 billion. We compete for advertising revenues with numerous websites, including major portals such as Yahoo/AOL, major search engines such as Google, major social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, and other online large media publications such as Buzzfeed, Huffington Post, New York Times, Washington Post, MSNBC and CNN.com. We also compete with many smaller news and politics-oriented Websites, such as Slate, The Daily Beast, The Atlantic, Talking Points Memo, Politico and Axios for staff, audience and advertising sales.
Infrastructure and Operations 
 
We have created a flexible publishing structure that enables us to develop our content while responding quickly to news events and to take advantage of the ease of distribution provided by the Internet. Our content is deployed on our proprietary software platform and captured in a database for reuse in Web and other formats. The content on our Website has been structured to facilitate being found by search engines, a key driver in increasing traffic to our Website, and optimized for sharing on social networks. In fiscal year 2018, we are working on a Website and advertising architecture redesign aimed at improving the user experience. As part of this effort, we will continue exploring new products that meet the immediate needs of our mobile users, building out new advertising products for video and mobile and improving our security and scaling capabilities 
 
Our Website is hosted on cloud-based virtual servers running open-source Linux operating systems and various open-source web and network software packages. Our top technical priority is the fast and reliable delivery of pages to our users. Our systems are designed to handle traffic growth and network failures by balancing the requests among several pools of servers across the globe that automatically scale to match traffic demands. We rely on multiple tiers of redundancy/failover and third-party Content Delivery Network to achieve our goal of 24 hours, seven-days-a-week Website uptime. Regular automated backups protect the integrity of our data. Our servers are continuously monitored by numerous third-party and open-source monitoring and alerting tools.
 
Proprietary Rights 
 
Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on the goodwill associated with our trademarks, trade names, service marks and other proprietary rights and on our ability to use U.S. laws to protect our intellectual property, including our original content, content provided by third parties, and content provided by columnists. We have a registered trademark on our Salon name and logo.

Employees
 
As of March 31, 2017, Salon has 39 full-time employees, and 5 part-time employees. We believe our relations with our employees are good. We started collective bargaining with our non-supervisory editorial employees in November 2015, and the results of this process are uncertain. Our future success is highly dependent on our ability to attract, hire, retain and motivate talented personnel.
