ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
------------+----------

Overview
 
On April 5, 2017, we and GKS Funding LLC, as administrative agent under the Loan Agreement (as defined below) (“GKS Funding”) entered into a Cooperation Agreement (the “Cooperation Agreement”) in connection with a loan (the “Loan”) made to us pursuant to that certain Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of February 1, 2017 (as amended and in effect from time to time, the “Loan Agreement”), between us, the Lenders party thereto and GKS Funding. On March 31, 2017, we received a notice of default from GKS Funding stating that we were in default of the Loan for failure to make a scheduled interest payment on the Loan that was due on March 31, 2017. If such failure described above was not cured within the 15-day cure period, which was April 15, 2017, the Lenders (through GKS Funding, as administrative agent under the Loan Agreement) intended to exercise all rights and remedies available to them under the Loan Agreement, related note and applicable law, which included foreclosing on the collateral under the Loan Agreement.
 
As of the date of the Cooperation Agreement, the outstanding balance of our obligations under the Loan Agreement was approximately $1,011,800, plus accrued and accruing legal fees and expenses. Over the past several months, we have experienced significant operating losses and have been unable to raise additional capital in order to pay the expenses necessary to continue to operate its business. For the same reason, we were unable to pay interest on the Loan on March 31, 2017 (the “Existing Default”).
 
As a result of the foregoing, and after considering all options, our Board of Directors determined that we would not have sufficient funds to cure the Existing Default on or before April 15, 2017. In addition, given our inability to raise additional capital to fund ongoing operations, we also determined that we would be unable to continue to operate as a going concern. Thus, we determined that it was in the best interests of all constituents that we cooperate with GKS Funding and its exercise of remedies.
 
Pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement, we and GKS Funding agreed as follows: (i) we waived the 15-day cure period with respect to the Existing Default immediately upon execution of the Cooperation Letter and GKS Funding has the right to exercise its remedies under the Loan Agreement and applicable law with respect to such event of default, including, without limitation, by scheduling and conducting a sale of all of the collateral under the Loan Agreement on or about April 17, 2017 (the “UCC Sale”); (ii) GKS Funding agreed to fund loans to us up to the date of the UCC Sale to permit us to pay the Budgeted Expenses (as defined in the Cooperation Agreement) as and when due with this new loan, which is (a) secured by a first priority security interest in all of our real and personal assets, property, fixtures, rights and interests, (b) shall have priority in payment over the Loan made pursuant to the Loan Agreement; and (c) shall be repaid, before any other payments are made by us, out of the first cash proceeds of the collateral received by us; and (iii) we consented to fully cooperate with GKS Funding in connection with the UCC Sale, as well as the exercise by GKS Funding of any of its other right and remedies in connection therewith.
 
In light of the foregoing, we do not anticipate that we will be able to continue in our current line of business. At this point, the Board is reevaluating its business plan and strategy and has not made any determination as to whether or not it will seek to engage in a new line of business.
 
During the past year, our sole operations were as an agricultural technology company. The products and processes that we owned and are being foreclosed upon by GKS Funding convert generally available agricultural by-products into multi-functional all-natural ingredients that can be used in food manufacturing and other industries. Our primary focus and the source of substantially all of our revenue during the past several years has been from the sale of our all-natural products, Z Trim®, to the food industry. Our business involved the sale of a line of all-natural products to the food industry designed to help manufacturers reduce their costs, improve the quality of finished goods, and solve many production problems.
 
Products
 
During the year ended December 31, 2016, our core product portfolio was comprised of multifunctional food ingredients that included Corn Z Trim® (both GMO and non-GMO) and Oat Z Trim®. The superior water-holding capacity and amorphous structure of Z Trim ingredients are key to the exclusive multifunctional attributes they contribute to food product design, including moisture management, oil deflection, texture and appearance quality, fat and calorie reduction. These attributes allow manufacturers using such products to reduce costs of finished products by replacing more expensive ingredients with our fiber and water.  Z Trim® is now being used by food manufacturers world-wide, across a multitude of food categories, such as meats, sauces, soups, dressings, baked goods, fillings, toppings, prepared meals, dairy products, frozen handheld snacks, and pizza dough. Food formulators are seeking greater functionality and product performance than they can get from starches, gums, fats, and other fibers – for both standard and lower fat content foods - and Z Trim® multifunctional ingredients can help to satisfy their consumers with finished products that we believe have enhanced eating quality, outstanding product performance, and frequently, improved nutritional profiles.

Product Distribution
 
Our food ingredients had been marketed through (i) direct and brokered sales to major food manufacturers, as well as small and midsize companies for packaged retail foods, and (ii) direct and brokered sales to large and small foodservice manufacturers that supply to restaurants, hospitals, schools and cafeterias. In addition to direct sales, we used a network of ingredient distributors, both domestic and international, to distribute our products.
Competition
 
Z Trim® ingredients have competed with a wide variety of hydrocolloids and other fiber ingredients.  Within the food industry, depending on the food application, required functional properties and product development objectives, competitive ingredients included gums (e.g., guar, xanthan, locust bean, and Arabic), seaweed extracts (e.g., alginates, carrageenan), starches (native, modified and resistant), and fibers (e.g., oat bran, corn bran, pea fiber, potato fiber).  Most of these competitive ingredients are well-established in the food industry, and many of the companies that supply them have substantially greater resources than we do.  However, we believe that the unique properties of our multifunctional fiber ingredients provide differentiation and growth opportunities for food companies.  We believe that no other single hydrocolloid or fiber has the combined water holding and binding capacity that is effective across as wide a pH and temperature range as Z Trim®, and that Z Trim® ingredients can have synergistic effects with other hydrocolloids and fibers, allowing food manufacturers to achieve greater processing improvements, cost efficiencies, and finished product performance.  Many of the same ingredients used in foods are also used for industrial applications, where they compete with a similar complement of ingredients.  
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and the Names of Principal Suppliers
 
Raw materials used in Z Trim® products are sourced principally in the United States.  Approximately 70% of the raw materials consist of corn bran and oat hulls, which are generally available from a variety of suppliers.  Our major suppliers included Agricor, Inc. and Brenntag, Inc.
 
Dependence on a Few Major Customers
 
Our customers have been predominantly food manufacturers.  There were three significant customers who accounted for 34%, 12% and 7%, respectively, of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. There were three significant customers who accounted for 45%, 10% and 6%, respectively, of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. The loss of any of these three customers we believe would have a material adverse effect on our revenue.
Intellectual Property
 
Our intangible assets included patents pending and issued, as well as trade secrets and know how. Through the process of development and commercialization of our technology, we had identified and sought patent protection for improvements to the manufacturing process and product applications. 
 
All of our intellectual property has been pledged as collateral to GKS Funding and we expect will be sold by GKS Funding when they sell the collateral on April 17, 2017.


On December 1, 2009, we were issued U.S. Patent No. 7,625,591 B2; which expires in 2026 subject to the payment of maintenance fees.  On July 27, 2010, we were issued U.S. Patent No. 7,763,301; which will expire in 2027 subject to payment of maintenance fees.  These patents expanded the raw material sources for the creation of Z Trim products as well as incorporate blends of ingredients combined with Z Trim.  
 
In March 2013 we, jointly with the USDA, filed a utility patent for our BioFiber Gum line of products, seeking patent protection for the composition of matter, process for making, as well as applications for, our proprietary soluble fibers (application number: PCT/US2014/0017376). In January 2015 the USDA commended global filings outside of the United States. On September 6, 2016, U.S. Patent No. 9,434,788 B2 was issued which expired in 2032 subject to the payment of maintenance fees.
 
We have four additional utility patents on file that cover composition, process and various applications of Z Trim and BioFiber Gum, each filed jointly with the USDA and pledged as collateral to GKS.

Government Regulation
 
As an agricultural technology company, we have been subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. Food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign agencies.  However, as ingredients are made from natural raw material sources (corn and oat), they are considered Generally Recognized As Safe or “GRAS” and therefore not subject to many of the regulations applicable to foods.
 
In October 2012, the FDA approved the labeling of the products that we have sold in meat applications. Specifically, the FDA has approved the use of the ingredients in ground, emulsified, and processed meats and poultry.  
 
Research and Development
 
Our R&D team, in conjunction with our customers and strategic industry partners, including the USDA, has worked on the development of additional products and applications.  In June 2011, we entered into a 3-year agreement with the USDA to conduct joint research for the development of additional products and processes relating to our current patented products. This agreement was amended and the duration extended through May 31, 2016.  In January 2017, we entered into a new 3-year agreement with the USDA to conduct joint research for the development of additional products and processes relating to our current patented products. We require all employees and visitors to our plant to execute a non-disclosure agreement.  Research and Development expense was $10,817 in the year ended December 31, 2016 and $181,713 in the year ended December 31, 2015.
Environmental Compliance
 
We have not faced any material environmental compliance issues as a result of our manufacturing process, however there can be no assurances that we will continue to comply in the future or that any future business we enter into will comply.
Employees
 
Presently, we have 14 full-time employees; however, that is expected to change after GSK Funding forecloses on our assets.
 
Our History
 
We were originally incorporated in the State of Illinois on May 5, 1994 under the original name Circle Group Entertainment Ltd.  On June 21, 2006, we filed a certificate of amendment to our certificate of incorporation and changed our name to Z Trim Holdings Inc. On March 23, 2016, we changed our state of incorporation by engaging in a merger (the “Reincorporation”) with and into our newly formed wholly owned subsidiary, Agritech Worldwide, Inc., a Nevada corporation, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into by Z Trim and Agritech on March 18, 2016 (the “Merger Agreement”).  The Reincorporation was consummated on March 23, 2016 and was effectuated by the filing of (i) articles of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, and (ii) articles of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Illinois. The Reincorporation effected a change in our legal domicile form Illinois to Nevada. Upon the effectiveness of the Reincorporation our affairs of ceased to be governed by (i) Illinois corporation laws, (ii) our Articles of Incorporation, and (iii) our Bylaws, and our affairs became subject to (a) Nevada corporation laws, (b) Agritech’s Articles of Incorporation of and (c) Agritech’s Bylaws. The resulting Nevada corporation is (i) be deemed to be the same entity as the Illinois corporation for all purposes under the laws of Nevada, (ii) continue to have all of the rights, privileges and powers of the Illinois corporation, (iii) continue to possess all properties of the Illinois corporation, and (iv) continues to have all of the debts, liabilities and obligations of the Illinois corporation.
