The Company 
 We are one of the worlds leading specialty retailers of fashionable jewelry and accessories for young women, teens, tweens and kids. Our vision is to be the emporium of choice for all girls (in age or attitude) across the world. We deliver this by offering a range of innovative, fun and affordable products and services that cater to all of her activities, as she grows up, whenever and wherever. Our broad and dynamic selection of merchandise is unique, and over 90% of our products are proprietary. Claires® is our primary global brand that we operate in 44 countries through company-operated stores, concession stores, or franchise stores. Claires® offers a differentiated and fun store experience with a treasure hunt setting that encourages our customer to visit often to explore and find merchandise that appeals to her. We believe that, by maintaining a highly relevant and ever changing merchandise assortment, offering a compelling value proposition, delivered in a fun and accessible way, Claires® has universal appeal to teens, pre-teens and kids. Icing® is our second brand which we currently operate in North America through company-operated stores and in other markets through franchise stores. Icing® offers an inspiring merchandise assortment of fashionable and affordable products that helps a young woman to say something about herself, whatever the occasion. We believe Icing® provides us with significant potential to reach young women in age groups beyond our Claires® core demographic. 
 We believe Claires® represents a Girls Best Friend and is a favorite shopping destination for teens, tweens, and kids. Claires® target customer is a girl between 3-18 years old for whom we create three distinct ranges: 3 to 6, 6 to 12 and 12 to 18. As of January 28, 2017, Claires® had a presence in 44 countries through the 2,414 company-operated Claires® stores in North America and Europe, 933 concession stores and 584 franchised stores in numerous other geographies. 
 The Icing® brand creates and curates an inspiring and accessible array of fashionable jewelry, cosmetics and accessories for young women in the 18-35 year age group. This customer is independent, fashion-conscious, and has enhanced spending ability. We believe that expansion of our Icing® brand both in existing and new markets over time presents a significant opportunity to leverage our core merchandising, sourcing and marketing expertise to cater to a wider demographic. Furthermore, the differentiation of our Claires® and Icing® brands allow us to operate multiple locations within a single mall or in close proximity. As of January 28, 2017, we operated 296 Icing® stores across the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico and 19 franchised stores overseas. 
 We are organized by geography through our North America division and our Europe division. In North America, our stores are located primarily in shopping malls and average approximately 1,000 square feet of selling space. In Europe, our stores are located primarily on high streets, in shopping malls and in high traffic urban areas and average approximately 665 square feet of selling space. Despite smaller average selling square feet, our European stores average similar sales per store as our North American stores. 
 For Fiscal 2016, we had net sales of $1,311.3 million, compared to $1,402.9 million in Fiscal 2015. We reported net income for Fiscal 2016 of $53.9 million, compared to net loss of $(236.4) million for Fiscal 2015. 
 Our Competitive Strengths 
 We have various competitive strengths that we believe have allowed us to operate successfully in many different global markets, as demonstrated by our ability over the past ten years to double the number of countries in which we operate to 44 countries as of January 28, 2017. We compete primarily on price, shopping experience, and merchandise assortment. Although we believe we have many competitive strengths, we recognize that we face competitive challenges, including the fact that large value retailers, department stores and some teen retail stores may have substantially greater financial, marketing, and other resources, and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their merchandise than we do.

We believe our competitive strengths include the following: 
 Category Defining Claires® Brand 
 A 
Claires® store is located in approximately 79% of all major United States shopping malls across all 50 states and in 43 countries outside of the United States, including markets where we franchise. We are a Girls Best Friend and believe we serve as an authority in jewelry and accessories for 3  18 year olds. We believe that our reputation for providing age-appropriate merchandise and shopping experience allows parents to trust the 
Claires® brand for their daughters. Our 
Claires® brand is regularly featured in editorial coverage and relevant fashion publications, both online and off. Additionally, we leverage our e-commerce and mobile commerce (m-commerce) platforms and social media to enhance our brand awareness and strengthen our customer relationships.
Preferred Shopping Destination 
 We are recognized as a favorite shopping destination for young women, teens, tweens, and kids. We believe our customer finds our store an engaging and stimulating experience that allows her to explore and share discoveries, thereby encouraging frequency of visits. Our employees are trained to provide friendly and effective service which we believe creates a memorable shopping experience. Besides jewelry and accessories, we also offer an exciting assortment of beauty products, lifestyle accessories and seasonal items to keep our customer engaged. As part of our jewelry offering, our stores have pierced the ears of approximately 98 million customers over the years, including approximately 3.5 million in Fiscal 2016. We believe this seminal point of contact helps our stores establish an important relationship with our core customer. In addition, this service brings traffic to the malls where our stores are located, making us an attractive tenant. We believe our store environment, product assortment and low average dollar ticket differentiate us from other retail concepts as well as pure play online platforms. 
Attractive Unit Economics with Strong Cash Flow 
 Our stores have relatively low build out costs and moderate inventory requirements. We manage our store portfolio on a store-by-store basis to optimize overall returns and minimize risk. When we choose to close a store it is generally because the store has negative or marginally positive cash flow or the stores anticipated future performance or lease renewal terms do not meet our criteria. As a result, for Fiscal 2016, approximately 93% of our stores were cash flow positive. 
 Our cash flow is driven by our strong gross margins, efficient operating structure, low annual maintenance capital expenditures and flexible growth capital expenditure initiatives. Our moderate working capital requirements result from high merchandise margins, low unit cost of merchandise, relatively lower seasonality of our business and relatively strong inventory turnover. However, we are significantly leveraged, with total debt of approximately $2.16 billion as of January 28, 2017. As a result, a large portion of our cash flow is devoted to our debt service obligations. In addition, as of January 28, 2017, we had a total accumulated deficit of $1,095.9 million, primarily as a result of non-cash goodwill impairment charges in Fiscal 2008, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016. 
 Although our capital growth expenditure initiatives are flexible, we must make decisions regarding fair market rent of real estate properties within the countries in which we operate in advance of entering into a new five to ten year lease or renewing an existing lease. Also, although we have relatively low seasonality, our business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences. Approximately 30% of our net sales typically occur in the fourth quarter, with the remaining 70% spread relatively evenly over the remaining three quarters. We have several peak selling periods in addition to Christmas, such as back-to-school, and a significant number of other holidays across the globe not necessarily applicable to other retailers, which we believe contribute to our relatively lower seasonality. If we are unable to anticipate, identify and react to changing styles and trends, we may need to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow moving inventory from time-to-time.

Globally Diversified with Proven Ability to Enter New Countries 
 The Claires® concept has a global scale and geographic portability. As of January 28, 2017, we operated or franchised a total of 2,998 Claires® stores across all 50 states of the United States and in 43 additional countries across the world. In addition, we have 933 concession stores across 12 countries. We also operated or franchised 315 Icing® stores as of January 28, 2017. In Fiscal 2016, we entered one new market on a franchise basis: Russia, and franchised 12 new Icing® stores overseas. In Fiscal 2015, we entered three new markets on a franchise basis: Pakistan, Thailand and South Africa, and franchised four new Icing® stores overseas. During Fiscal 2014, we entered one new market on a franchise basis: Martinique, and franchised three new Icing® stores overseas. Over the past 10 years, we have doubled the number of countries in which we operate or franchise. 
 Cost-Efficient Global Sourcing Capabilities 
 Our merchandising strategy is supported by efficient, low-cost global sourcing capabilities diversified across approximately 471 suppliers located primarily outside the United States. Our vertically integrated Hong Kong buying office was established over 20 years ago and now sources a majority of our purchases. Our strategy of offering proprietary merchandise coupled with vertically-integrated local buying capabilities is designed to enable us to source rapidly and cost effectively. We believe our vertically integrated sourcing capabilities enable us to respond to quickly changing consumer trends. 
Business Strategy 
 Our business strategy is designed to maximize our sales opportunities, earnings growth and cash flow. 
 Generate Organic Growth 
 Enhance Merchandise and In-Store Experience 
 We are focused on enhancing the fashion-orientation and quality of our product offerings to deliver a unique, proprietary assortment that is highly relevant to our target customers. We believe we can drive growth through intensifying key merchandise categories as well as introducing new categories that matter to our customer as her tastes and needs change over time. 
 We believe we can drive increased frequency of visits through our unique and compelling in-store environment. We aim to provide a consistent, engaging and brand-right customer experience across all of our company-operated and franchised stores worldwide. Additionally, we focus on improving ease of shopping and increasing sales productivity by enhancing store layout and merchandise displays. We will continue to develop our store management teams and sales associates emphasizing in-store operational excellence. 
 Deepen Customer Relationship & Loyalty 
 We will continue to drive brand awareness and deepen customer relationships with our branding efforts conducted through in-store marketing collateral, influencer partnerships, and ongoing digital, social media, and email campaigns. Maintaining and improving our leadership in ear piercing also allows us to solidify the customers experience with Claires® and establish brand loyalty early. We believe we can leverage our 5 million strong social and email community to drive increased customer engagement for Claires® and Icing®.Company-Operated Store Base 
 We opened 46, 15 and 9 new company-operated stores in Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, respectively. Of our nine new stores opened in Fiscal 2016, six were in North America and three were in Europe. In January 2014, we made a decision to close our China stores and have closed all of our 17 company-operated stores in that country. We plan to open one new store in Fiscal 2017. In North America, the Claires® brand has significant penetration but we continue to opportunistically pursue additional locations. Historically, our remodel capital expenditures have produced increased sales returns similar to our new store expenditures. We typically target our most productive stores for remodel as they tend to deliver the best return on capital. We also evaluate stores whose leases are up for renewal and are likely to undergo a remodel. We plan to remodel approximately 20 additional Claires® and Icing® stores in Fiscal 2017. 
 
7 
 
Concession Store Expansion 
 In recent years, we have taken steps to expand our concession store base in North America and Europe, opening 111, 595, and 281 concession stores in Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, respectively. We partner with prominent retailers and provide our merchandise for sale within the partners retail location. Most of our concession locations are not located within traditional shopping malls. By partnering, we avail ourselves access to new sales channels that enable us to diversify our dependence on mall based locations. In connection with the concession store sales, we are obligated to pay a commission to the partner when our products are sold within the partners stores. We experienced significant growth in number of stores opened in Fiscal 2016 and plan to continue this growth by opening approximately 140 concessions stores net of closures in Fiscal 2017. 
Franchise in New Countries 
 Developing a robust franchising model has allowed us to gain a foothold in multiple international geographies and we believe that high potential white space opportunities remain. In Fiscal 2016, we entered one new market: Russia, and franchised 12 new Icing® stores overseas. In Fiscal 2015, we entered three new markets: Pakistan, Thailand and South Africa, and franchised four new Icing® stores overseas. In Fiscal 2014, we entered one new market: Martinique, and franchised three new Icing® stores overseas. We are studying our brand introduction strategy for markets such as South America and Australia via our franchise model and we will continue to evaluate new countries for franchised stores. In addition, we believe the Icing® brand represents an additional opportunity for franchise growth. 
 Grow Our E-Commerce Sales 
 We believe that, over time, our digital platform represents a valuable tool for engaging with our customer, gathering feedback on her preferences and enhancing our product testing capabilities, all of which should drive higher sales productivity both in-store and online. We have invested in the development of our social media channels and have experienced significant increases in the follower bases of our Instagram®, YouTube®, Snapchat®, WeHeartIt®, Facebook®, Twitter®, and Pinterest® pages and intend to further drive engagement, advertising and sales through these channels. 
 During Fiscal 2016, we strengthened our digital marketing activities to deliver to our customer a targeted shopping experience across the device of her choice. As a result, we: 
 

 | Grew sales driven by growth from our Europe division;

Merchandising 
 The Claires® mission is to be the Girls Best Friend brand for fun, fashionable, and value priced jewelry and accessories targeted at our core demographic of girls between 3-18 years old. To increase this focus, in Fiscal 2016, we realigned our buying and merchandising teams from three separate teams into one global team with a product focus on our under 12 and over 12 markets. Our merchandising team is keenly aware of the psychographics of our core customer and her ever-changing tastes and attitudes. We strive to connect with her as our friend with whom we share her most personal milestones  be it a first ear piercing, a first day at school, a first date, or a first job. We work to present a broad yet curated product assortment in an environment where girls and young women feel encouraged to express their personalities, creativity, and individuality. Our merchandising strategy leverages our authority as a jewelry destination and ear piercing specialist. Besides our core jewelry and accessories products, other important categories include hair accessories, our licensed product assortment, tech accessories and our beauty businesses. Our other accessories categories allow us to reflect seasonal changes in the business and the customer mindset, and we develop strong event assortments to capitalize on key traffic periods, like Prom, Back-To-School, Halloween, and Holiday. 
 For Fiscal 2016, the company-wide average in-store unit selling price for our products was $5.98 and the average transaction value was $16.94. Each Claires® store offers approximately 8,000 SKUs in the following major product categories: 
 

 | Jewelry: Includes earrings as well as our ear piercing service, necklaces, bracelets, body jewelry and rings; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Accessories: Includes hairgoods; beauty products; room decor; personal, fashion, and seasonal accessories, including tech accessories such as phone cases, jewelry holders, stationery, key rings, attitude glasses, headwear, legwear, armwear, and sunglasses; and handbags and small leather goods.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The following table shows a comparison of sales by product category: 
 

 | Percentage of Total | 
Product Category | Fiscal 2016 | | Fiscal 2015 | | Fiscal 2014
Jewelry | | 45.6 | | 45.2 | | 47.5 
Accessories | | 54.4 | | 54.8 | | 52.5 
 | | 100.0 | | 100.0 | | 100.0

 The mission of Icing® is to be the Say Something brand focused on smart, trend right products that are appropriate for young women aged 18-35, with a particular focus on women in their mid 20s. Jewelry is the dominant category for Icing®, but the accessories business in highly penetrated as well. Key accessories categories include handbags, small leather goods, and tech accessories. Hair accessories are also important, and the beauty business is developing an excellent range of nail, eye, lip, and beauty tools products. The Icing® customer expresses her unique style and individuality through our products, and we enable the many dimensions of her personality and viewpoints to shine.

Over 90% of our merchandise consists of proprietary designs that carry the Claires® or Icing® label. The remainder consists of licensed products featuring brands such as Disney, Ty, Shopkins or selected entertainment properties, such as 5 Seconds of Summer. Our wide range of products allows us to capitalize on a spectrum of trends, ideas and merchandise concepts, while not being dependent on any one of them. 
 Purchasing and Distribution 
 Our global sourcing group purchases merchandise from a diversified base of approximately 471 suppliers. Our vertically integrated buying office in Hong Kong has been in operation for over two decades and sources approximately 60-65% of our products. In Fiscal 2016, we purchased 84% of our merchandise from vendors based outside the United States, including 71% of those purchases made by our Hong Kong buying office. We are not dependent on any single supplier for our products. In Fiscal 2016, our Hong Kong buying office purchased over 90% of its merchandise from approximately 100 suppliers, none of which supplied more than 10% of total purchases made by our Hong Kong buying office. 
 Our distribution facility in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, ships merchandise to our North America stores, including our concession stores. Our distribution facility in Birmingham, United Kingdom services all of our stores in Europe, including our concession stores. We distribute merchandise to our franchisees from a third party-operated distribution center in Hong Kong. Our distribution centers ship merchandise by common carrier to our individual store locations. To keep our assortment fresh and exciting, we typically ship merchandise to our stores three to five times per week. 
 Stores 
 As of January 28, 2017, we operated a total of 2,710 stores, including 296 Icing® stores. We also have 933 concession stores throughout North America and Europe. We franchised 603 stores globally, including 19 Icing® stores. Approximately 139 of those franchise locations are concession format stores. Our company-operated stores, globally average net sales of approximately $470,000 and net sales per square foot of $462 for Fiscal 2016. 
Store Design and Environment 
 The in-store shopping experience is integral to the Claires® and Icing® brands. Our Claires® stores are designed and merchandised to allow our customer to discover appealing merchandise in a treasure hunt setting. We strive to maintain a consistent look and experience across all of our company-operated, concession stores, and franchised stores through a disciplined plan-o-gram process that coordinates floor plan changes 8-10 times per year. 
 Our stores in North America are located primarily in shopping malls and average approximately 1,000 square feet of selling space. Our stores in Europe are located on high streets, in shopping malls and in high traffic urban locations and average approximately 665 square feet of selling space. Our store hours are dictated by shopping mall operations which are typically from 10:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Monday through Saturday and where permitted by law, from noon to 5:00 p.m. on Sunday. In Fiscal 2016, approximately 41% of our sales were made in cash, with the balance made by checks, debit cards, and credit cards. 
 Each of our stores is typically led by a manager and a full-time assistant manager. In addition, each store has one or more part-time employees, depending on store volume. Concession stores are supported either by their nearby company-operated stores or, by dedicated concession teams when no nearby company-operated stores exist in that market. We utilize a labor scheduling model that optimizes the number of hours allocated to appropriately staff for varying sales volumes expected during each week. Our developing concession business provides further opportunities to optimize labor scheduling. 
 New Stores and Store Economics 
 We have a standardized procedure for the efficient opening of new stores and their integration into our information and distribution systems. The floor plan, merchandise layout and marketing efforts are developed specific to each new location. In addition, we maintain qualified store opening teams to provide training to new store employees. On average, we open a new store within one-to-two months from the commencement of construction. 
 
10 
 
We have experienced in-house real estate and development capabilities. During Fiscal 2016, we opened nine new company-operated stores globally. Our capital investment, which includes build-out costs and cash preopening costs, amounted to $12.7 million for new stores opened and remodels completed in Fiscal 2016. During the past three fiscal years, we have remodeled 186 stores and plan to remodel a total of approximately 20 stores in Fiscal 2017. Sales at our new stores ramp quickly and generate attractive returns. 
 Company-Operated Store Openings and Closings 
 In Fiscal 2016, we opened 9 stores and closed 166 underperforming stores, for a net decrease of 157 stores. When we choose to close a store it is generally because the store has negative or marginally positive cash flow or the stores anticipated future performance or lease renewal terms do not meet the Companys criteria. In North America, we decreased our store count by 100 stores, net, to 1,641 stores. In Europe, we decreased our store count by 57 stores, net, resulting in a total of 1,069 stores. Stores, net refers to stores opened, net of closings. In January 2014, we closed all of our 17 stores in China.

 We plan to open one company-operated store and close approximately 150 company-operated stores globally in Fiscal 2017. We also plan to continue opening stores when suitable locations are found and satisfactory lease negotiations are concluded. In addition to the investment in leasehold improvements and fixtures, we may also purchase intangible assets or incur initial direct costs for leases relating to certain store locations in our Europe operations. In Fiscal 2016, the average sales per store of our new stores were almost 5.3 times that of our average closed stores.

Financial Information About Segments 
 See Note 14  Segment Reporting in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
Marketing and Advertising 
 We rely on a multi-channel approach to marketing and advertising with a very limited reliance on traditional television, radio and print mediums. We have developed our public relations capability since 2012, initially in our main markets in Europe and, since 2014, in the United States. Given Claires® focus as a shopping destination, we invest in locating our stores in prominent, high-traffic locations. Our stores feature colorful displays showcasing our fun proprietarily designed merchandise, latest trends and key items, adding to the fun and playful atmosphere of the store. Our brands are also featured on the tags attached to most of our products. We believe that our Claires customer develops an affinity for our stores through frequent visits, social engagement, and through word-of-mouth publicity from her peers. 
 Our digital marketing effort includes our e-commerce and m-commerce sites, for Claires® and Icing®, both in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and France, which launched from Fiscal 2011. These have a look and feel consistent with the in-store experience. We also drive brand awareness and relevance with digital media, social media and email campaigns which are complementary to in-store key items and marketing. We leverage our social presence by posting engaging fun content focused on key trend items, behind the scenes snippets, and user generated images, and have over 3.1 million followers across our social channels. We use our email database to send regular emails to over 1.8 million customers who have provided their email addresses through our website or in-store registration process, including when customers get their ears pierced. In September 2015, we launched our first mobile app in the U.S. and in the U.K., which has been downloaded over 382,000 times. 
 Trademarks and Service Marks 
 We are the owner in the United States of various marks, including Claires®, Claires Club®, and Icing®. We have also registered these marks outside of the United States. We currently license certain of our marks under franchising arrangements in Japan, the Middle East, Greece, Guatemala, Malta, India, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Panama, Indonesia, Costa Rica, Serbia, Sweden, Romania, Martinique, Pakistan, Thailand, Southern Africa and Russia. 
 Concurrently with the Exchange Offer described elsewhere in this annual report, our subsidiary that holds our trademarks, CBI Distributing Corp. (CBI) transferred certain intellectual property rights (the Transferred IP) to our subsidiary, CLSIP LLC. The Transferred IP consists of (a) an undivided 17.5% interest (the US Claires Marks Ownership Interest) in all (i) trademark registrations and applications for trademark registration issued by or filed with any federal government authority in the United States related to the Claires ® brand, (ii) common law trademark rights in and to the Claires ® brand in the United States, and (iii) the associated goodwill of the assets described in clauses (i) and (ii); in each case, whether in existence or later adopted, filed, or acquired (collectively, the US Claires Marks); (b) all (i) trademark registrations and applications for trademark registration issued by or filed with any federal government authority in the United States related to the Icing ® brand, (ii) common law trademark rights 
 
12 
 
 in and to the Icing ® brand in the United States, and (iii) the associated goodwill of the assets described in clauses (i) and (ii); in each case, whether in existence or later adopted, filed, or acquired (collectively, the US Icing Marks); (c) certain internet domain names that incorporate, correspond with or are otherwise related to the Claires ® and Icing ® brands (the Domain Names); and (d) a mobile application agreement pursuant to which the Claires ® mobile application is licensed from a third party (the Mobile Application Agreement). 
 In addition, concurrently with the Exchange Offer, CLSIP entered into the Intellectual Property Agreement (the Transferred IP Agreement) with CBI , the Company and certain of its other domestic subsidiaries (Claires Parties), pursuant to which the Claires Parties will pay to CLSIP an annual fee of $12.0 million in exchange for (i) the exclusive right to use and exploit the US Icing Marks, the Domain Names and the Mobile Application Agreement, (ii) the exclusive right to use, exploit, register, enforce and defend the US Claires Marks, and (iii) CLSIPs acknowledgment that it will not exercise any rights in or to the US Claires Marks, either directly or indirectly, during the term of the Transferred IP Agreement without CBIs prior written consent; in each case, solely during the term of the Transferred IP Agreement and subject to the terms contained therein. 
 We believe our rights in our marks are important to our business and intend to maintain our marks and the related registrations. 
 Franchise strategy 
 Claires® has a strong global franchise platform with sophisticated franchise partners possessing strong retail experience, who also operate other leading retail brands. Claires® utilizes relationships with its franchisees to increase penetration in existing franchise markets, and intends to develop new franchise partnerships for entry into new geographic markets. During Fiscal 2016, we entered one new market on a franchise basis for Claires® and opened 12 Icing® stores overseas. Typically, franchise agreements range between 510 years, and provide the option for renewals. Claires® and Icing® earn license and merchandise fees on merchandise shipped to franchisees and a mark-up on merchandise sold. We generally expect, based on our historical experience, that two to three franchise stores will be equivalent to the operating income contribution of one company-operated store. In addition, there is no capital expenditure or working capital requirement for Claires ® and Icing® when a franchise partner opens a store. 
 Information Technology 
 Information technology is important to our business success. Our information and operational systems use a broad range of both purchased and internally developed applications to support our retail operations, financial, real estate, merchandising, inventory management and marketing processes. Sales information is generally collected from point of sale terminals in our stores on a daily basis. We have developed proprietary software to support key decisions in various areas of our business including merchandising, allocation and operations. We periodically review our critical systems to evaluate disaster recovery plans and the security of our systems. 
Competition 
 The specialty retail business is highly competitive. We compete on a global, national, regional, and local level with other specialty and discount store chains and independent retail stores. Our competition also includes Internet, direct marketing to consumer, and catalog businesses. We also compete with department stores, mass merchants, and other chain store concepts. We cannot estimate the number of our competitors because of the large number of companies in the retail industry that fall into one of these categories. We believe the main competitive factors in our business are brand recognition, merchandise assortments for each target customer, compelling value, store location, e-commerce and m-commerce capabilities, speed to market, and the shopping experience.

We compete primarily on price, shopping experience, and merchandise assortment. Although we believe we have many competitive strengths, we recognize that we face competitive challenges, including the fact that large value retailers, department stores and some junior retail stores have substantially greater financial, marketing, and other resources, and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their merchandise than we do. 
 We believe we do not have a direct competitor of scale that focuses purely on our product categories. As a result, we believe we are highly differentiated from other teen apparel players and benefit from meaningful margins, in addition to having a significant international presence. 
 Seasonality 
 Sales of each category of merchandise vary from period to period depending on current trends. We experience traditional retail patterns of peak sales during the Christmas, Easter, and back-to-school periods. Sales as a percentage of total sales in each of the four quarters of Fiscal 2016 were 23%, 24%, 24% and 29%, respectively. 
Employees 
 On January 28, 2017, we employed approximately 18,200 employees, 67% of whom were part-time. Part-time employees typically work up to 20 hours per week. We consider employee relations to be good.
