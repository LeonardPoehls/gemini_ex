Item 1. Business.
GENERAL
 
We are a publicly traded holding company conducting substantially all of our operations through our principal operating subsidiary, ZAIS Group, LLC (“ZAIS Group”), an investment advisory and asset management firm focused on specialized credit. ZAIS Group is a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary of ZAIS Group Parent, LLC (“ZGP”), which is our majority-owned consolidated subsidiary.  Our Class A common stock (“Class A Common Stock”) is traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker symbol “ZAIS”.  We are headquartered in Red Bank, New Jersey and also maintain an office in London. Prior to March 2015, we were a publicly traded special purpose acquisition corporation called HF2 Financial Management Inc. (“HF2”). On March 17, 2015, we completed a business combination transaction with ZGP (the “Business Combination”), whereby we acquired a 66.5% interest in ZGP and changed our name to ZAIS Group Holdings, Inc.  In the Business Combination, HF2 made a $78.2 million cash contribution to ZGP and effected the transfer of all its outstanding shares of Class B common stock (“Class B Common Stock”) to the members of ZGP (including Christian Zugel, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Investment Officer, the former managing member of ZGP and the founder and Chief Investment Officer of ZAIS Group (“Mr. Zugel”), and certain related parties, collectively, the “ZGP Founder Members”). 
 
ZAIS Group was formed in 1997 and is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), and with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) as a Commodity Pool Operator (“CPO”) and Commodity Trading Advisor (“CTA”). ZAIS Group provides investment advisory and asset management services to private funds, separately managed accounts, structured vehicles (collateralized debt obligation vehicles and collateralized loan obligation vehicles, together referred to as “CLOs”) and, until October 31, 2016, ZAIS Financial Corp. (“ZFC REIT”), a publicly traded mortgage real estate investment trust (collectively, the “ZAIS Managed Entities”). The ZAIS Managed Entities predominantly invest in a variety of specialized credit instruments including corporate credit instruments such as collateralized debt obligations or loan obligations, securities backed by residential mortgage loans, bank loans and various securities and instruments backed by these asset classes. ZAIS Group had approximately $4.512 billion of assets under management (“AUM”) as of December 31, 2017. ZAIS Group also serves as the general partner to certain ZAIS Managed Entities, which are generally organized as pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. ZAIS Group’s AUM is primarily comprised of (i) total assets for mark-to-market funds and separately managed accounts; (ii) uncalled capital commitments, if any, for funds that are not in liquidation; and (iii) for issued structured vehicles, all assets being managed calculated per the management fee basis methodology defined in the respective vehicles’ indenture, although in certain circumstances some or all of the referenced management fees may be waived. AUM also includes assets in the warehouse phase for new structured credit vehicles and is based on actual assets managed without reductions for leverage and most other liabilities and includes all assets regardless of whether management fees are being earned.

ZAIS Group employed 59 employees across its investment management, client relations, information technology, law, compliance, risk management, finance and operations groups as of March 19, 2018. The ZAIS Group team includes 25 investment professionals as of March 19, 2018 and is led by Mr. Zugel. The number of investment professionals will be reduced by three employees on March 31, 2018 in connection with the reduction in force commenced on March 1, 2018. Refer to Item 1. Business – “Employees” for additional information.


On February 15, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company (“Board of Directors”) formed a special committee of independent and disinterested directors (the “Special Committee”) to consider proposals for strategic transactions, as well as to consider all other strategic options for the Company. Subsequently, the Special Committee’s review of potential strategic alternatives included capital raising, asset sales, strategic partnerships, a sale of the entire Company, a sale of component parts of the Company, acquisitions and other options, including continuing operating as a public company.  Thereafter, Mr. Zugel reported to the Board of Directors that he was considering making a proposal that would be beneficial to the Company’s stockholders and which would result in the Company going private. Mr. Zugel made a proposal for a take private transaction to the Special Committee on September 5, 2017. Over the next several months Mr. Zugel and the Special Committee negotiated his proposal.
 
On January 11, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Z Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Z Acquisition”), and ZGH Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger as a subsidiary of Z Acquisition. Mr. Zugel is the sole managing member of Z Acquisition, and Daniel Curry, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, President and a Director (“Mr. Curry”), is a member of Z Acquisition. At the effective time of the Merger, shares of Class A Common Stock (“Class A Common Stock”), other than shares held by Mr. Zugel, affiliates of Mr. Zugel, and certain other shareholders, will be converted into the right to receive $4.10 per share in cash without interest, subject to any required withholding taxes. All outstanding restricted stock units (“RSUs”) are held by the Company’s independent directors and will also be converted in the Merger into the right to receive $4.10 per share in cash for the number of shares of Class A Common Stock underlying such RSUs. The proposed Merger is a “going private transaction” under SEC rules. There is no assurance that the Merger will be consummated. For a discussion of various risks relating to the Merger, see “Item 1A Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Merger,” and for additional information regarding the Merger, see our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 12, 2018.
 
The Company continually reviews its business and fund activities with a view towards improving our profitability. As a result of concluding that a planned expansion of our capabilities in the residential mortgage whole loan market would no longer be a part of our future strategy, a reduction in expenses related to infrastructure staffing was made by completing a reduction in force on March 8, 2016, which resulted in a decrease of 23 employees of ZAIS Group. At December 31, 2017, the Company had 59 employees compared with 60 employees at December 31, 2016. On October 31, 2016, the Company’s management agreement with ZFC REIT was terminated upon completion of a merger between ZFC REIT and Sutherland Asset Management Corp, which resulted in a decrease of $0.589 billion in ZAIS Group’s AUM during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016. As a result of the termination of the ZFC REIT management agreement, management fees earned by ZAIS Group decreased by approximately $2.5 million in 2017 compared to 2016 (estimated to be approximately $2.8 million on an annualized basis). The decrease in management fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 was offset by the receipt of a termination payment from ZFC REIT in the amount of $8.0 million that ZAIS REIT Management LLC (“ZAIS REIT Management”), a consolidated subsidiary of ZAIS Group, received pursuant to a termination agreement between ZAIS REIT Management and ZFC REIT (the “Termination Agreement”).
 
Broad Credit Investment Products Platform. ZAIS Group’s current investments include, but are not limited to, non-agency and agency residential mortgage backed securities (“RMBS”), commercial real estate (“CRE”) investments including commercial mortgage backed securities (“CMBS”), CRE loans and commercial properties, asset-back securities (“ABS”), corporate CLOs, individual corporate debt securities, leveraged loans, and structured corporate synthetics. Within these products, ZAIS Group invests predominantly in mezzanine and subordinate securities.

Diverse Client Base and Product Mix. Since its inception in 1997, ZAIS Group has built long-term relationships with an international investor base, including public and private pension funds, endowments, foundations, insurance companies, family offices, fund of funds, sovereign wealth funds and investment advisors. ZAIS Group manages assets using a range of strategies and investment vehicles, including hedge funds, hybrid private equity funds, separately managed accounts, structured vehicles such as CLOs and, until October 31, 2016, ZFC REIT. The chart set forth below provides a breakdown of our AUM by investor type.
 
AUM by Investor Type as of December 31 (1): 
 


(1) | ZAIS Group’s December 31, 2016 AUM uses values for certain structured vehicles that are prior to December 31, 2016 based on the most recent trustee report received as of December 31, 2016 for each respective vehicle.

 | ZAIS Group’s December 31, 2017 AUM uses values for certain structured vehicles that are prior to December 31, 2017 based on the most recent trustee report received as of December 31, 2017 for each respective vehicle.

ZAIS’s Investment Vehicles
 

• | ZAIS Group manages customized solutions in the form of separately managed accounts and funds of one that are tailored to the investment objectives of investors. The investors in these managed accounts may generally contribute additional capital or withdraw capital with little or no notice. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | CLOs purchase debt or loans and finance the purchases through the issuance of new debt and equity securities. Series of notes are issued with different risk-return profiles based on their position in the capital structure and payment waterfalls. The “equity securities” in such a structure typically take the first loss risk and are entitled to any excess returns from the vehicle. Should the credit quality of the portfolio deteriorate the equity securities will often be cut off from any distributions in order to protect the more senior debt tranches and accelerate their amortization.
• | ZAIS Group’s hedge funds generally permit new and existing fund investors to contribute capital on a periodic basis (typically monthly) and to redeem their capital on a periodic basis. These funds have an indefinite life as long as they have investors and ZAIS Group elects to continue their existence. 
• | ZAIS Group’s hybrid private equity style funds generally permit investors to make capital commitments when the fund is formed and these commitments are drawn down as the fund makes investments. Capital is returned to fund investors on distribution dates after the investment period has ended (averaging three years) and there is an anticipated termination date for the respective funds. In general, fund investors may not withdraw or redeem capital during the investment period and additional fund investors are not permitted to join the fund after the fund’s final closing date.

ZAIS’s Investment Strategies
 
Corporate Debt Strategies
 
ZAIS Group’s corporate credit expertise, analytics platform and experienced credit analysts allow ZAIS Group to provide solutions and insight to optimize portfolios backed by corporate debt. ZAIS Group believes, regardless of product form or credit ratings, that integrating a breadth of information across corporate credit markets can generate investment ideas and risk management processes capable of generating above average returns. ZAIS Group has consistently sought to offer its investors opportunities to capitalize on dislocated markets across the corporate credit spectrum. As of December 31, 2017, ZAIS Group has approximately $3.163 billion deployed in corporate debt strategies.
Mortgage Strategies
 
ZAIS Group’s mortgage investment platform combines a skilled team of experienced mortgage investors with analytical and risk management systems focused on the residential and commercial mortgage sectors. ZAIS Group has organized its internal resources to address opportunities across the mortgage markets as such opportunities evolve. Over time, ZAIS Group has successfully positioned its platform to capitalize on market dislocations and the subsequent recovery of the mortgage securities and the Government Sponsored Enterprises’ relative value trading opportunities. ZAIS Group has built an integrated investment platform focused on analyzing and managing securitized mortgage loan assets. ZAIS Group believes these strategies are well suited to the current mortgage environment to capitalize on market conditions. As of December 31, 2017, ZAIS Group has approximately $0.102 billion deployed in mortgage strategies.
 
Multi-Strategy Vehicles
 
ZAIS Group also uses its credit expertise and analytics platform to manage multi strategy funds that focus on various specialized credit investments. Some of these multi strategy funds contain investments in mortgage and corporate debt strategies referred to above. As of December 31, 2017, ZAIS Group has approximately $1.247 billion deployed in multi-strategy funds.

(4) | ZAIS Group does not earn management fee income on two ZAIS Managed Entities in which it had made investments that carry first loss risk. ZAIS Group receives distributions of its pro rata share of the gains and losses related to its investments in these ZAIS Managed Entities and incentive income equal to 50% of the net investment gains for the management of these ZAIS Managed Entities.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
For the management of its investment products and other vehicles, ZAIS Group receives fees and other income as follows:
 
Management Fee Income
 
Management fee income is typically based on a fixed annual percentage of net assets of the ZAIS Managed Entities and it is intended to compensate ZAIS for managing the investments. These fees are generally collected on a monthly or quarterly basis.
 
Funds and accounts: Management fees earned by ZAIS Group for funds and accounts are generally based on net asset value prior to the accrual of incentive fees/allocations or drawn capital during the investment period.
 
CLOs:  Management fees earned by ZAIS Group for the CLOs it manages are generally based on the par value of the collateral and cash held in the CLOs.
 
ZFC REIT: Through October 31, 2016, management fees earned by ZAIS Group from ZFC REIT, were based on ZFC REIT's stockholders' equity, as defined in the amended and restated investment advisory agreement between ZAIS REIT Management and ZFC REIT. Twenty percent of the management fee income received from ZFC REIT was paid to holders of Class B interests in ZAIS REIT Management. On October 31, 2016, the management agreement with ZFC REIT was terminated upon completion of the merger between ZFC REIT and Sutherland Asset Management Corp which resulted in a decrease to ZAIS Group’s AUM of approximately $0.589 billion during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016. In addition to the reduction in ZAIS Group’s AUM, management fees earned by ZAIS Group decreased by approximately $2.5 million in 2017 compared to 2016 (estimated to be approximately $2.8 million on an annualized basis for future periods) as a result of the Termination Agreement. The decrease in management fees earned from ZFC REIT for the year ended December 31, 2016 was offset by the receipt of a termination payment in the amount of $8.0 million.
Incentive Income
 
In some cases, ZAIS Group receives incentive income when certain pre-agreed financial hurdles have been met.
 
Funds and accounts:  For ZAIS Managed Entities with hedge fund-style fee arrangements, incentive income earned by ZAIS Group is based on a percentage of the net realized and unrealized profits attributable to each investor, subject to a hurdle (if any) set forth in each respective entity’s operative agreement. Additionally, all of ZAIS Group’s funds and accounts with hedge fund-style fee arrangements are subject to a perpetual loss carry forward or “high-water mark,” meaning that the funds and accounts will not pay incentive fees/allocations to ZAIS Group with respect to positive investment performance generated for an investor in any year following negative investment performance until that loss is recouped, at which point an investor’s capital balance surpasses the high-water mark. For funds and accounts with private equity-style fee arrangements, incentive income earned by ZAIS Group is based on a priority of payments under which investor capital must be returned and a preferred return, as specified in each fund’s operative agreement, must be paid to the investor prior to any payments of incentive income to ZAIS Group. 
 
CLOs:  For CLOs, incentive income is earned based on a percentage of all profits, subject to the return of contributed capital (and subordinate management fees, if any), and a preferred return as specified in the respective CLO’s collateral management agreements.
 
ZFC REIT: The advisory agreement between ZAIS REIT Management and ZFC REIT did not provide for ZAIS Group to earn incentive income from ZFC REIT.

Capital Invested In and Through ZAIS Group’s Products
 
As further alignment of ZAIS Group’s interests with those of its investors, ZAIS Group and certain eligible employees have invested capital in certain ZAIS Managed Entities.
Regulatory and Compliance Matters
 
ZAIS Group is subject to extensive regulation by a number of regulators and self-regulatory organizations that have the authority to authorize, and in specific circumstances to limit, restrict or prohibit regulated entities from carrying out particular activities if they fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations. A significant failure to comply could expose ZAIS Group to liability or reputational damage. Further, new legislation, heightened regulatory oversight of fundraising activities, changes in rules of self-regulatory organizations or exchanges or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations may directly affect ZAIS Group’s operations and profitability.
 
Rigorous legal and compliance analysis of ZAIS Group’s businesses and investments is ingrained in its culture. ZAIS Group strives to maintain a culture of compliance through the use of carefully tailored policies and procedures, monitoring and oversight, a code of ethics, compliance systems, communication of compliance guidance and employee education and training, including by making clear that doing business in compliance with applicable law and regulations is the responsibility of each of ZAIS Group’s employees. ZAIS Group has compliance professionals, led by a Chief Compliance Officer, who monitor ZAIS Group’s compliance with regulatory requirements to which ZAIS Group is subject and manages ZAIS Group’s compliance policies and procedures. ZAIS Group’s compliance policies and procedures address a wide variety of regulatory and compliance obligations that arise under the various bodies of law that apply to ZAIS Group’s business. Senior management is involved in various aspects of ZAIS Group’s compliance program.
 
United States
 
ZAIS Group is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser pursuant to the Advisers Act. The Advisers Act, together with the SEC’s regulations and interpretations thereunder, is a highly prescriptive regulatory statute. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act, ranging from fines and censures to termination of an adviser’s registration and, in the case of willful violations, can refer a matter to the Unites States Department of Justice for criminal prosecution.
 
Under the Advisers Act, an investment adviser (whether or not registered under the Advisers Act) owes fiduciary duties to its clients. These duties impose standards, requirements and limitations on, among other things, trading for proprietary, personal and client accounts; allocations of investment opportunities among clients; use of “soft dollars,” a practice that involves using client brokerage commissions to purchase research or other services that help managers make investment decisions; execution of transactions; and recommendations to clients. On behalf of its investment advisory clients, ZAIS Group makes decisions to buy and sell securities for each ZAIS Managed Entity, selects broker dealers to execute trades and negotiates brokerage compensation.
 
The Advisers Act also imposes specific restrictions on an investment adviser’s ability to engage in principal and cross transactions. ZAIS Group policy permits cross trades so long as no client is disfavored. Generally, cross trades between clients will be permitted if: (1) third party bids are obtained to assess appropriate market values, (2) ZAIS Group receives any necessary client permissions following disclosure of certain material facts related to any such trade and (3) complete records are maintained. Any cross trades involving assets for which third party bids are not available will only be executed after obtaining a reasonable, independent indicator of value and approval from the ZAIS Group Conflicts/Cross Trade Committee. ZAIS Group does not receive any special compensation for cross trades. While cross trades may create the appearance of a conflict of interest, ZAIS Group believes its cross trade procedures mitigate the potential conflict and provide all parties to the transaction with a fair and equitable price.
 
As a registered investment adviser, ZAIS Group is subject to additional requirements that cover, among other things, disclosure of information about its business to clients; maintenance of written policies and procedures; maintenance of extensive books and records; restrictions on the types of fees ZAIS Group may charge; custody of client assets; client privacy; advertising; and solicitation of clients. The SEC has legal authority to inspect any investment adviser and typically inspects a registered adviser periodically to determine whether the adviser is conducting its activities in compliance with (i) applicable laws and regulations, (ii) disclosures made to clients and (iii) adequate systems, policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent and detect violations.

Under the Advisers Act, ZAIS Group’s investment management agreements may not be assigned without the client’s consent. The term “assignment” is broadly defined and includes direct assignments as well as assignments that may be deemed to occur upon the transfer, directly or indirectly, of a controlling interest in ZAIS Group.
 
Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act provides a “safe harbor” to investment managers who use commission dollars generated by their advised accounts to obtain investment research and brokerage services that provide lawful and appropriate assistance to the manager in the performance of investment decision-making responsibilities. ZAIS Group, as a matter of policy, does not use “soft dollars” and so it has no incentive to select or recommend a broker or dealer based on any interest in receiving research or related services. Rather, ZAIS Group selects brokers based on its clients’ interest in receiving best execution.
 
With respect to certain investment vehicles, ZAIS Group is also registered with the CFTC as a CPO or CTA. ZAIS Group is also a member of the National Futures Association (“NFA”), the commodity and futures industry self-regulatory organization that inspects CPOs and CTAs for compliance with the CFTC’s and its own rules and regulations. As with the Advisers Act, the CEA governs many aspects of ZAIS Group’s derivatives-related business.
 
ZAIS Group is also a member of various Swap Execution Facilities (“SEFs”), each of which is a self-regulatory organization with its own rulebook, and with inspection and enforcement authority. The SEFs of which ZAIS Group is a member have contracted with the NFA to conduct compliance inspections of their members.
 
United Kingdom
 
ZAIS Group (UK) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of ZAIS Group is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom. Its regulatory authorizations fall within the framework established by the European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (as implemented into English law) and encompass, among other things, the ability to advise on investments, manage investments and arrange deals in investments for non-retail clients. ZAIS Group (UK) Limited has exercised its right to provide these services to clients across the European Economic Area (“EEA”) by passporting its regulatory authorizations into all other EEA member states.
 
ZAIS Group (UK) Limited does not hold client money and, on the basis of its size and systemic importance, the Financial Conduct Authority has classified it as a “flexible portfolio firm”.
 
Competition
 
ZAIS Group competes in all aspects of its business with other investment management companies, including investment funds, hedge funds, private equity funds and traditional and non-traditional financial services companies, including commercial banks and insurance companies. ZAIS Group faces competition in the pursuit of outside investors for its funds. ZAIS Group also pursues investment opportunities for client accounts and for ZAIS Group alongside many competitors.
 
ZAIS Group competes for outside investors based on a variety of factors, including:
 

• | investment performance;
--+------------------------


• | investor perception of investment managers’ drive, focus and alignment of interest;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | terms of investment, including the level of fees and expenses charged for services;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ZAIS Group’s actual or perceived financial condition, liquidity and stability;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


12
--


• | ZAIS Group’s investment professionals and its non-investment staff;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the quality and mix of services provided to, and the duration of relationships with, investors; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ZAIS Group’s business reputation.
--+----------------------------------

 
In order to grow its business, ZAIS Group must be able to compete effectively for outside investors. ZAIS Group must also effectively execute its investment strategies on behalf of its clients and itself. ZAIS Group’s ability to successfully implement its investment strategies is based on a variety of factors, including:
 

• | the experience and insights of its management team;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the research and recommendations of its portfolio management team;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | its efficient investment analysis and decision-making processes; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the effective support of its analytics platform and trading personnel.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Many of ZAIS Group’s competitors are substantially larger and may possess greater financial and technical resources. Several of these competitors have recently raised, or are expected to raise, significant amounts of capital and many of them have similar investment objectives to ZAIS Group, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities. Some of these competitors may also have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to ZAIS Group, which may create competitive disadvantages for ZAIS Group with respect to investment opportunities. Some of these competitors may have higher risk tolerance, make different risk assessments or have lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments, bid more aggressively for investments that ZAIS Group wants to make or accept legal or regulatory limitations or risks ZAIS Group would be unable or unwilling to accept. Moreover, an increase in the allocation of capital to alternative investment strategies by institutional and individual investors could lead to a reduction in the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies that many of ZAIS Group’s investment funds seek to exploit. Alternatively, a decrease in the allocation of capital to alternative investments strategies could intensify competition for that capital and lead to fee reductions and redemptions, as well as difficulty in raising new capital.
 
Competition is also intense for the attraction and retention of qualified employees. ZAIS Group’s ability to continue to compete effectively in its businesses depends upon its ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate existing employees.
 
Employees
 
ZAIS believes that one of the strengths and principal reasons for its success is the quality and dedication of its people. The Company continually reviews its business and fund activities with a view towards improving our profitability. As a result of concluding that a planned expansion in our capabilities in the residential whole loan market would no longer be a part of our future strategy, a reduction in expenses related to infrastructure staffing was made by completing a reduction in force on March 8, 2016 which resulted in a decrease of 23 employees of ZAIS Group.
 
On February 27, 2017, Howard Steinberg, our former General Counsel, resigned effective March 31, 2017 and was retained as Senior Legal Advisor to the Company and ZAIS effective April 1, 2017.
 
On November 20, 2017, Gregory Barrett resigned as our Head of Business Development and Client Relations effective immediately. Mr. Barrett remained an employee of ZAIS through December 31, 2017 and was available to conduct business at our request.
 
On January 5, 2018, we announced that Michael Szymanski had tendered his resignation as Chief Executive Officer, President and a Director and that the Company’s Board of Directors had elected Daniel Curry to succeed Mr. Szymanski in these positions. Mr. Szymanski’s resignation was effective as of the close of business on January 5, 2018 and the election of Mr. Curry was effective as of January 8, 2018.

On March 1, 2018, ZAIS Group commenced a reduction in force which resulted in a decrease of three employees who will remain employees through March 31, 2018. In connection with this reduction in force, ZAIS Group provided notice on March 12, 2018 to two counterparties, that it would be terminating the investment management agreements related to such accounts.
 
As of March 19, 2018, ZAIS Group employed 59 individuals, including 25 investment professionals, located in its Red Bank and London offices. At December 31, 2017, ZAIS Group had 59 employees compared with 60 employees at December 31, 2016. The number of investment professionals will be reduced by three employees on March 31, 2018 in connection with the reduction in force commenced on March 1, 2018.
