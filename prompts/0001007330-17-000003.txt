ITEM 1. Business
PRGX Global, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is a global leader in recovery audit and spend analytics services, providing services within our clients' Source-to-Pay ("S2P") business processes. Our services include recovery audit, spend analytics and supplier information management ("SIM") services. We are based in the United States of America (“U.S.”) and serve clients in more than 30 countries. PRGX Global, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Georgia in 1996. At the heart of our client services portfolio is the core capability of mining client data to deliver “actionable insights.” Actionable insights allow our clients to improve their financial performance by reducing costs, improving business processes, managing risks and increasing profitability.
The vast majority of our revenue comes from recovery audit, a service based on the mining of a tremendous amount of our clients’ purchasing-related data, looking for overpayments made to their third-party suppliers. PRGX is the world's leading provider of accounts payable recovery audit services principally to large businesses and government agencies with high volumes of transactions and complex pricing arrangements with vendors. We provide services to 75% of the top 20 global retailers and over 20% of the top 50 companies in the Fortune 500. We earn the largest portion of our revenue from our retail clients. Recovery audit in the retail industry is a mature service offering and we have been serving a number of our clients for decades. Pricing of merchandise for resale in the retail industry is extremely complex due to the high volume of promotions, allowances and rebates provided by suppliers. The second largest portion of our business is referred to within the recovery audit business as “commercial.” Commercial recovery auditing is the delivery of recovery audit services to industries other than retail, such as telecommunications, automotive and industrial manufacturing, resources, financial services, and transportation. Recovery audit in the industries represented within commercial is typically less complex in terms of vendor pricing structure, scope of purchase transactions made available for audit and depth of audit programs within individual companies. “Contract compliance” auditing is a specific type of recovery auditing which is more heavily utilized by commercial clients and is expected to be a growing part of our business. This service offering focuses on auditing complex supplier billings against large services, construction and licensing contracts, and is relevant to a large portion of our client base. We continue to innovate through technological advances, new audit tools and expanded service offerings, including spend analytics and SIM services. These services target client functional and process areas where we have established expertise, enabling us to provide services to finance, merchandising and procurement executives to improve working capital, optimize purchasing leverage in vendor pricing negotiations, improve insight into product margin and true cost of goods for resale, identify and manage risks associated with vendor compliance, improve quality of vendor master data and improve visibility and diagnostics of direct and indirect spend. These service offerings are increasingly important to our business and are applicable to clients in both retail and commercial industries. 
PRGX is unique in that we are a global recovery audit services provider, serving clients in over 30 countries across a multitude of industries. We conduct our operations through three reportable segments: Recovery Audit Services - Americas, Recovery Audit Services - Europe/Asia-Pacific and Adjacent Services. The Recovery Audit Services - Americas segment represents recovery audit services we provide in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and is our largest segment in terms of clients served and revenue generated. The Recovery Audit Services - Europe/Asia-Pacific segment represents recovery audit services we provide in Europe, Asia and the Pacific region and is responsible for a significant portion of our revenue. Our Adjacent Services offerings are generally provided to clients on a global basis. We report the unallocated portion of corporate selling, general and administrative expenses not specifically attributable to the three reportable segments in Corporate Support. For additional financial information relating to our reporting segments, see Note 2 - Operating Segments and Related Information of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
In October 2016, we announced that we had entered into agreements to acquire Cost & Compliance Associates, LLC and Cost & Cost Compliance Associates Limited (together, “C&CA"), a commercial recovery audit and contract compliance firm with operations in the U.S. and the U.K., and Lavante, Inc. (“Lavante”), a Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS")-based SIM and recovery audit services firm based in San Jose, California. The Lavante acquisition closed in October 2016 and the C&CA acquisition closed in February 2017.
As of December 31, 2015, the Company discontinued its Healthcare Claims Recovery Audit ("HCRA") business. PRGX has entered into agreements with third parties to fulfill its Medicare recovery audit contractor ("RAC") program subcontract obligations to audit Medicare payments and provide support for claims appeals and assigned its remaining Medicaid contract to another party. The Company will continue to incur certain expenses while the current Medicare RAC contracts are still in effect.

The Recovery Audit Industry and PRGX
Many businesses and government agencies generate substantial volumes of payment transactions involving multiple vendors, numerous discounts and allowances, fluctuating prices and complex pricing arrangements or rate structures. Although these entities correctly process the vast majority of payment transactions, errors occur in a small percentage of transactions. These errors include, but are not limited to, missed or inaccurate discounts, allowances and rebates, vendor pricing errors, erroneous coding and duplicate payments. Many factors contribute to the errors, including communication failures between the purchasing and accounts payable departments, complex pricing arrangements or rate structures, personnel turnover and changes in information and accounting systems. In the aggregate, these transaction errors can represent meaningful amounts of reduced cash flow and lost profits for these entities. Recovery auditing is a business service focused on finding overpayments created by these errors. These audits are either accounts payable audits or contract compliance audits and entail comprehensive and customized data acquisition from the client, frequently including purchasing, receiving, point-of-sale, pricing and deal documentation, emails, and payment data. 
PRGX, like most companies in the recovery audit services industry, generates the majority of its revenue through contingent fee arrangements, sharing a pre-determined percentage of successful claims or “recoveries” generated from an audit. There are certain recovery audit services or types of audits that are billed as a fixed fee or on a time and materials basis, but the vast majority of our revenue is generated through contingent fee contracts. 
Recovery audit clients generally recover claims by either (a) taking credits against outstanding payables or future purchases from the involved vendors or service providers, or (b) receiving refund checks directly from those vendors or service providers. Industry practice generally dictates the manner in which a client receives the benefit for a recovery audit claim. In many cases, we must satisfy client-specific procedural guidelines before we can submit recovery audit claims for client approval. 
Contracts with recovery audit clients generally vary in length from one year to three years, with some being evergreen. Most of our recovery audit contracts provide that the client may terminate the contract without cause prior to the completion of the term of the agreement by providing relatively short prior written notice of termination. 
As businesses have evolved, PRGX and the recovery audit industry have evolved with them, innovating processes, error identification tools, and claim types to maximize recoveries. The following are a number of factors impacting recovery auditing:
•Data Capture and Availability. Businesses increasingly are using technology to manage complex procurement and accounts payable systems in an effort to realize greater operating efficiencies. Many businesses worldwide communicate with vendors electronically - whether by Electronic Data Interchange (“EDI”) or the Internet - to exchange inventory and sales data, transmit purchase orders, submit invoices, forward shipping and receiving information and remit payments. These systems capture more detailed data, which should further inform transactional reviews by recovery auditors.
•Increased Role of Email Documentation in Client Transaction Data. Clients and vendors increasingly document transaction terms in email correspondence that is not integrated into their financial or merchant deal systems, which increases opportunities for errors. To efficiently identify these errors, recovery audit firms must use sophisticated technology-based tools that are able to ingest and search through massive volumes of emails to identify potential errors that then are investigated by the auditors. A comprehensive recovery audit requires the effective use of technology-based email search tools and techniques.
•Increasing Number of Auditable Claim Categories. Traditionally, the focus of a recovery audit was on a simple, or “disbursement,” claim type, such as the duplicate payment of invoices. Enhancements to accounts payable software, particularly large enterprise software solutions used by many large companies, have reduced the extent to which these companies make simple disbursement errors. However, the introduction of creative vendor discount programs, complex pricing arrangements and activity-based incentives has led to an increase in auditable transactions and potential sources of error. These transactions are complicated to audit, as the underlying transaction data is difficult to access and recognizing mistakes can be complex. Recovery audit firms such as PRGX with significant industry-specific expertise and sophisticated technology are best equipped to audit these complicated claim categories.
•Globalization. As the operations of business enterprises become increasingly multi-national, they often seek service providers with a global reach. Sophistication in systems and processes varies markedly across the global network of suppliers which further drives the need for our services. PRGX serves clients in more than 30 countries and we believe we are the recovery audit service provider best suited to deliver multi-national audits.
•Significant Promotional Activity. Trade promotion spending is substantial within the retail trade and significant sums are being spent in categories with numerous transactions and a high potential for errors, such as scan downs, or discounts at the point of sale. Because of the high volume of trade promotion within retail, there are significant opportunities for mistakes and, therefore, auditable claims.

•Technology Platform. The ability to efficiently and cost effectively ingest large volumes of structured and unstructured data is critical to providing best in class recovery audit services. We believe we have developed the most sophisticated and highest performing large data processing infrastructure system in our industry. This system is based on the Hadoop open source technology standard and allows us to effectively process and manage our clients’ data in large scale volumes and at superior speeds. We are achieving significant acceleration in data processing speeds for both structured and unstructured data sets, which supports our efforts to accelerate audit results and transform our core audit processes.
We expect the evolution of the recovery audit industry to continue. In particular, we expect that the industry will continue to move towards the electronic capture and presentation of data, more automated, centralized processing and auditing closer to the time of the payment transaction.
Adjacent Services 
Our Adjacent Services business, targets client functional and process areas where we have established expertise, enabling us to provide services to our clients' finance, merchandising and procurement functions to improve working capital, optimize purchasing leverage in vendor pricing negotiations, improve insight into product margin and true cost of goods for resale, identify and manage risks associated with vendor compliance, improve quality of vendor master data and improve visibility and diagnostics of direct and indirect spend. Our Adjacent Services include our global PRGX OPTIXTM analytics solution and our SIM services offering, which includes the CIPS Sustainability Index ("CSI") offered in the United Kingdom through our strategic alliance with the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply ("CIPS"). As our clients’ supplier base, data volumes and complexity levels continue to grow, we are using our deep data management experience to develop new actionable insight solutions, compliance-related tools, analytics solutions and data transformation services. Taken together, our deep understanding of our clients’ S2P data and our Adjacent Services solutions provide multiple routes to help our clients achieve greater profitability.
Clients
PRGX provides its services principally to large businesses and government agencies having a tremendous volume of payment transactions and complex procurement environments. Retailers continue to constitute the largest part of our client and revenue base. Our five largest clients contributed approximately 37.3% of our revenue from continuing operations in 2016, 34.5% in 2015 and 32.2% in 2014. We have one client, The Kroger Co., that accounted for approximately 11% of our revenue from continuing operations in 2016, while no client accounted for 10% or more of our revenue from continuing operations in 2015 or 2014.
Some organizations (primarily large retailers) maintain internal recovery audit departments to recover certain types of payment errors and identify opportunities to reduce costs. Despite having such internal resources, many companies also retain independent recovery audit firms, such as PRGX, due to their specialized knowledge, capabilities and focused technologies. In the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Mexico, Brazil, and Australia, large retailers routinely engage independent recovery audit firms as a standard business practice. It is typical in the retail industry for large firms to engage a primary audit firm at one contingency fee rate and a secondary firm to audit behind the primary at a higher rate. Our commercial recovery audit clients are typically Fortune 1000 companies in industries other than retail and with multi-billion dollars of purchase transactions to be audited. These clients range from large multi-national manufacturing and resource companies, to large regional or national telecommunications and financial services institutions to global high tech software organizations. The audit specialty practice of contract compliance is a specific type of recovery auditing which is more heavily utilized by commercial clients and is expected to be a growing part of our business. This service offering focuses on auditing complex supplier billings against large services, construction and licensing contracts, and is relevant to a large portion of our client base.

The PRGX Strategy 
PRGX is a global leader in recovery audit and spend analytics services. We provide recovery audit and other S2P services, including, spend analytics and SIM services. We principally offer these services to large businesses and government agencies having a tremendous volume of payment transactions and complex procurement environments. We plan to achieve revenue growth and higher profitability through the following strategy:
1.Grow and improve our core recovery audit business;
2.Differentiate our service offerings and capabilities;
3.Create adjacent service offerings, including SaaS solutions; and
4.Expand into new high potential industries and geographies.
Grow and improve our core recovery audit business
We continue to be the industry leader by introducing innovative concepts and audit processes. In addition, we are deploying global best practices and rolling out enhanced world class and proprietary audit tools to drive deeper recoveries and enable next generation audit concepts. We expect to achieve our objectives through process redesign coupled with investing in our technology infrastructure and aggressively rolling out new technologies across our global audits. 
Differentiate our service offerings and capabilities
We plan to differentiate our service offerings and capabilities through enhancing our current services and implementing innovations such as:

• | Audit acceleration. Our clients are constantly seeking to accelerate the audit process to deliver audit results closer to the time of the transaction to increase recovery yields, provide a greater opportunity to address process errors, and reduce supplier abrasion. We believe that our deep and broad business process experience across thousands of audits, together with our enhanced and new technology initiatives will put us in a unique position to achieve superior results for our clients.


• | Global audit best practice programs. Our global programs take advantage of our operations that span over 30 countries to provide true global audit capabilities to multi-national companies. This unique perspective gives our clients visibility to their business practice variations around the world and creates value for our clients by allowing them to see their data in new ways.

Create adjacent and high value service offerings
We will continue to focus on new service offerings that complement our existing services and provide increased value to our customers.
Our Adjacent Services offerings, including PRGX OPTIX and SIM services, target client functional and process areas where we have established expertise, enabling us to provide services to support our clients' finance, merchandising and procurement functions. These services can be project-based (advisory services), which are typically billed on a rates and hours basis, or subscription-based (typically SaaS offerings), which are billed on a monthly basis. The Adjacent Services offerings assist our clients in improving many aspects of their businesses, including working capital, optimization of purchasing leverage in vendor pricing negotiations, improved insight into product margin and true cost of goods for resale, identification and management of risks associated with vendor compliance, improved quality of vendor master data and improved visibility and diagnostics of direct and indirect spend.
Expand into new high potential industries and geographies
Our plans include continuing to build our commercial recovery audit practice, which serves industries outside of retail in order to reduce our industry concentration. We have organized the commercial recovery audit practice into industry verticals such as resources, telecommunications, financial services and manufacturing, and are building focused practice areas with targeted service offerings for each industry.

Technology
PRGX uses advanced, proprietary information systems and processes and a large-scale technology infrastructure to conduct its audits of clients’ payment transactions. The ability to efficiently and cost effectively ingest large volumes of structured and unstructured data is critical to providing best in class recovery audit and spend analytics services. We believe we have developed the most sophisticated and highest performing large data processing infrastructure system in the recovery audit industry. This system is based on the Hadoop open source technology standard and allows us to effectively process and manage our clients’ data. We are achieving significant acceleration in data processing speeds for both structured and unstructured data sets, which supports our efforts to accelerate audit results, transform core audit processes and deliver actionable spend analytics insights.
We believe that our proprietary technology and processes serve as important competitive advantages over both our principal competitors and our clients’ internal recovery audit functions. To sustain these competitive advantages, we continually invest in technology initiatives to deliver innovative solutions that improve both the effectiveness and efficiency of our services.
We design our data acquisition, data processing and data management processes with the objectives of maximizing efficiencies and productivity and maintaining the highest standards of transaction auditing and spend analytics accuracy. We also maintain sophisticated and highly reliable security standards and tools to protect all data under our control. At the beginning of a typical recovery audit or spend analytics engagement, we use a dedicated staff of data acquisition specialists and proprietary tools to acquire a wide array of transaction data from the client for the time period under review. We typically receive this data by secured electronic transmissions, digital media or paper. For paper-based data, we use a custom, proprietary imaging technology to scan the paper into electronic format. Upon receipt of the data, we secure, catalog, back up and convert it into standard, readable formats using third party and proprietary tools.
Our technology professionals clean and map massive volumes of structured and unstructured client data, primarily using high performance database and storage technologies, into standardized layouts at one of our secure data processing facilities. We also generate statistical reports to verify the completeness and accuracy of the data.
We then process the data using proprietary algorithms (business rules) leveraging over thirty years’ experience to help uncover patterns or potential problems in clients’ various transactions or transactional streams. We deliver this processed data to our auditors who, using our proprietary audit software, sort, filter and search the data to validate and identify actual transaction errors. We also maintain a secure database of audit information with the ability to query on multiple variables, including claim categories, industry codes, vendors and audit years, to facilitate the identification of additional recovery opportunities and provide recommendations for process improvements to clients.
Once we identify and validate transaction errors, we present the information to clients for approval and submission to vendors as “claims.” We offer a proprietary web-based claim presentation and collaboration tool to help the client view, approve and submit claims to vendors.
In providing our spend analytics services, we use proprietary algorithms and technologies to clean and classify a client’s vendor spend data down to the line item level. We then are able to present this information to the client as a multi-dimensional data cube over a web-based interface. We believe these proprietary algorithms and technologies provide us with a competitive advantage over many of our competitors.
As part of our Adjacent Services we offer the PRGX OPTIX suite of analytics tools. The PRGX OPTIX suite facilitates S2P business decisions through actionable, data-enabled insights that are delivered through four primary modules - Product, Payment, Spend and Supplier.  Each of these modules is powered by the core PRGX OPTIX platform that provides the ability to process and visualize S2P data delivered via a SaaS interface. In addition to the PRGX OPTIX suite, we offer SIM services through our proprietary Lavante SIM platform. The SIM platform is designed to enable supplier master data harmonization, on-boarding, compliance with regulatory and client specified standards and requirements, as well as an enterprise level view of supplier performance. Lavante SIM is offered as a SaaS-based technology solution.

Competition
Accounts Payable Recovery Audit Services
We believe that the principal providers of domestic and international accounts payable recovery audit services in major markets worldwide consist of PRGX, two substantial competitors, and numerous other smaller competitors. The smaller recovery audit firms generally do not possess multi-country service capabilities and advanced technology infrastructure necessary to support our clients' large and complex purchasing and accounts payable operations. In addition, many of these firms have limited resources and may lack the experience and knowledge of national promotions, seasonal allowances and current recovery audit practices. As a result, we believe that compared to most other firms providing accounts payable recovery audit services, PRGX has competitive advantages based on its domestic and international presence, well-trained and experienced professionals, and advanced technology.
While we believe that PRGX has the greatest depth and breadth of audit expertise, data and technology capabilities, scale and global presence in the industry, we face competition from the following:
Client Internal Recovery Audit Departments. A number of large retailers (particularly those in the discount, grocery and drug store sectors) have developed an internal recovery audit process to review transactions prior to turning them over to external recovery audit firms. The scale and scope of these client internal organizations varies by client based on their level of in-house expertise and investment in required tools and technologies. Regardless of the level of recoveries made by internal recovery audit departments, virtually all large retail clients retain at least one (primary), and frequently two (primary and secondary), external recovery audit firms to capture errors not identified by their internal recovery audit departments.
Other Accounts Payable Recovery Audit Firms. The competitive landscape in the recovery audit industry is comprised of:

• | Full-service accounts payable recovery audit firms. We believe that only two companies other than PRGX offer a full suite of U.S. and international recovery audit services;


• | A large number of smaller accounts payable recovery firms which have a limited client base and which use less sophisticated tools to mine disbursement claim categories at low contingency rates. These firms are most common in the U.S. and U.K. markets. Competition in most international markets, if any, typically comes from small niche providers;


• | Firms, including one of our two substantial competitors, that offer a hybrid of audit software tools and training for use by internal audit departments, or general accounts payable process improvement enablers; and 


• | Firms with specialized skills focused on recovery audit services for discrete sectors such as sales and use tax, telecom, freight or real estate.

Other Providers of Recovery Audit Services. The major international accounting firms provide recovery audit services; however, we believe their practices tend to be primarily focused on tax-related services.
Adjacent Services
Our Adjacent Services business faces competition from global and regional consulting firms; well-known ERP software vendors; procurement-specific software and SaaS providers and smaller, very specialized analytics providers. These competitors generally compete on the basis of the breadth of services, market reputations and integration with other services. We believe that we differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our in-depth knowledge of our clients’ data, systems, and purchasing processes, along with advanced and specialized technology tools.
 Hiring, Training and Compensation of Personnel
Many of our auditors and other professionals formerly held finance-related management positions in the industries we serve. Training primarily is provided in the field by our experienced professionals enabling newly hired personnel to develop and refine their skills and improve productivity. We also use various other training materials such as process manuals and documented policies and procedures to supplement the field training provided by our experienced professionals. We periodically upgrade our training programs based on feedback from auditors and changing industry protocols. Many of our professionals participate in one of our incentive compensation plans that link their compensation to the financial performance of their service offering(s).

Proprietary Rights
From time to time, we develop new software and methodologies that replace or enhance existing proprietary software and methodologies. We rely primarily on trade secret and copyright protection for our proprietary software and other proprietary information. We capitalize the costs incurred for the development of computer software that will be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed or that will be used in our operations beginning when technological feasibility has been established. We consider the costs associated with developing or replacing methodologies to be research and development costs and we expense them as incurred. Research and development costs, including the amortization of amounts previously capitalized, were approximately $3.5 million in 2016, $3.0 million in 2015 and $3.1 million in 2014. 
We own or have rights to various trademarks, trade names and copyrights, including U.S. and foreign registered trademarks and trade names and U.S. registered copyrights, that are valuable assets and important to our business. We monitor the status of our copyright and trademark registrations to maintain them in force and renew them as appropriate. The duration of our active trademark registrations varies based upon the relevant statutes in the applicable jurisdiction, but generally endure for as long as they are used. The duration of our active copyright registrations similarly varies based on the relevant statutes in the applicable jurisdiction, but generally endure for the full statutory period. Our trademarks and trade names are of significant importance and include, but are not limited to, the following: PRGX®, Discover Your Hidden Profits®, Thrive in the Data™, imDex™, Profit Discovery™,  GET™; PRGX APTrax™, PRGX AuditTrax™, PRGX ClaimTrax™, PRGX MailTrax™, PRGX MerchTrax™, PRGX SpendTrax™, Lavante®, Lavante SIM TM and PRGX OPTIXTM.
Regulation
Various aspects of our business, including, without limitation, our data flows and our data acquisition, processing and reporting protocols, are subject to extensive and frequently changing governmental regulation in the U.S. and the numerous other countries around the world where we operate. These regulations include extensive data protection and privacy requirements. In the U.S., we are subject to the provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) with respect to our discontinued HCRA business. Internationally, we must comply with the European Data Protection Directive that various members of the European Union have implemented, as well as with data protection laws that exist in many of the other countries where we serve clients. Failure to comply with such regulations may, depending on the nature of the noncompliance, result in the termination or loss of contracts, the imposition of contractual damages, civil sanctions, damage to our reputation or in certain circumstances, criminal penalties.
Employees
As of January 31, 2017, PRGX had approximately 1,500 employees, of whom approximately 600 were in the U.S. The majority of our employees are involved in our recovery audit business. 
Website
PRGX makes available free of charge on its website, www.prgx.com, its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports. PRGX makes all filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") available on its website no later than the close of business on the date the filing was made. In addition, investors can access our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov. 
We also post certain corporate governance materials, including our Board of Directors committee charters and our Code of Conduct and Code of Ethics For Senior Financial Officers, on our website under the heading “Corporate Governance” on the “Investors” page. From time to time, we may update the corporate governance materials on our website as necessary to comply with rules issued by the SEC or NASDAQ, or as desirable to further the continued effective and efficient governance of our company.
