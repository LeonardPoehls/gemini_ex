Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 We are the leading provider of Technology Business Management, or TBM, solutions. We pioneered the TBM software category to provide the strategic business management system for the CIO because IT needed a data-driven system comparable to those leveraged by other enterprise functions such as sales, human resources and finance. Our cloud-based platform and SaaS applications enable IT leaders to analyze, optimize and plan technology investments, and to benchmark their financial and operational performance against peers. We empower IT leaders to transform IT into a service provider, to navigate the cloud transition, and to shift technology resources to drive more business innovation. 
 Our TBM solutions consist of a powerful, cloud-based platform and a suite of SaaS applications: Cost Transparency, IT Benchmarking, Business Insights, Bill of IT and IT Planning. Our data and analytics platform leverages proprietary modeling capabilities, powerful self-service analytics and planning workflows to enable customers to make actionable, data-driven strategic and operational decisions. Our platform automatically aggregates, cleanses and establishes relationships across large amounts of customer data from disparate sources and maps the data into our standard IT operating model. Our solutions are the business system of record for our customers’ IT organizations. 
 Technology has become a strategic imperative for enterprises regardless of size and industry, driven by the digitalization of business processes. To gain and maintain a competitive advantage, IT leaders must focus more time and resources on transforming their IT business while optimizing their existing infrastructure and applications. IT organizations manage large budgets and are faced with a rapidly changing, vastly more complicated and increasingly diverse technology and vendor ecosystem. In the absence of a TBM solution, some IT leaders attempt to manage their investments manually using spreadsheets or general purpose business intelligence tools, while others do not even try. 
 Enterprise IT is undergoing a fundamental transition as cloud computing and technology-as-a-service delivery models offer compelling benefits and economics. IT organizations must transition from traditional internally delivered IT infrastructure and applications to a more hybrid and service-oriented approach. This hybrid delivery and service model allows modern IT organizations to optimize service options and deliver IT as a service to meet business needs, but evaluating, deciding and managing between alternatives is complex. IT organizations are in the early stages of a long-term transformation to delivering IT as a service through the use of public and private clouds as well as third party service providers. Our SaaS applications enable IT leaders to make data-driven decisions, such as which workloads to move into the cloud or leave on-premise. 
 Our growing customer base spans a broad spectrum of industries, including financial services, professional services, technology, energy, consumer goods, manufacturing, healthcare, media, retail and transportation, as well as federal and state government agencies. We offer our solutions on a subscription basis, with subscription fees based on spend managed by our applications and the number of applications or capabilities for which the customer has subscribed. Our customers’ annual IT spend ranges from less than $10 million to billions of dollars.
 We formed the Technology Business Management Council, or TBM Council, as a separate non-profit entity in 2012 to foster the growth of the TBM category. The TBM Council has become the leading community for CIOs, IT professionals and IT finance professionals dedicated to advancing the discipline of managing the business of IT, with over 4,500 members as of December 31, 2017. This community establishes industry-endorsed best practices for TBM and helps create a powerful network effect for TBM solutions. Our relationship with the TBM Council helps us introduce a growing body of CIOs and other leaders to the advantages of TBM and to our solutions. 
 On February 2, 2018, we acquired Digital Fuel SV, LLC, or Digital Fuel, a provider of IT financial management solutions. Except where specifically indicated below, this Form 10-K does not include the results of Digital Fuel’s business. 
 We had total revenue of $188.5 million, $160.6 million and $129.3 million, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 17% and 24% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. For 2017, 2016 
 3


and 2015, our net losses were $25.6 million, $31.6 million and $41.0 million, respectively, as we focused on growing our business. 
 Our Opportunity 
 We believe the total addressable market for TBM solutions is large and largely unpenetrated. The total addressable market for our solutions is driven by global IT spend, which Gartner, an independent technology industry and market research firm, forecast in a July 2016 report to be $2.7 trillion for 2016, which is the sum of all enterprise IT spending by vertical industry market worldwide. Subscription fees for our applications are based primarily on the customer’s annual costs being managed by our applications and the number of applications or capabilities for which the customer has subscribed. We typically sell a subset of the five applications we offer so that customers can realize a rapid time to value from a targeted implementation, and seek to sell additional applications over time. Assuming full deployment of all of our current applications, subscription fees typically range from 0.1% to 0.5% of a customer’s annual IT spend. With a reasonable expectation of our ability to penetrate the market, we believe that the current total addressable market for our existing TBM solutions is approximately $6.0 billion. 
 We also believe that, with the development of additional capabilities and applications, our platform can be extended to other areas of customers’ businesses. In fact, our solutions are currently deployed by several customers to address a variety of non-IT, enterprise business management use cases in shared services such as legal, human resources and facilities and for analyzing operational metrics such as unit costs of various offerings or transactions, and we believe that enterprise business management use cases such as these represent future market opportunities. If we are successful in our strategy of developing and selling additional applications beyond our current offerings, we believe that our market opportunity will expand. 
 Our Technology Business Management Solutions 
 We provide the business system of record for our customers’ IT organizations, which enables them to analyze, optimize and plan investments, and benchmark their financial and operational performance against peers. Our TBM solutions consist of a powerful, cloud-based platform and a suite of SaaS applications that empower IT leaders to understand, communicate and transform IT to drive greater value from technology investments. 
 Key elements of our solutions include: 
 Adaptive Data Management. Our purpose-built, cloud-based data and analytics platform aggregates, cleanses and correlates large amounts of customer data from a wide variety of disparate sources. Our platform automatically establishes relationships between data from various sources and transforms the data into intuitive, dynamic and easily usable reports through our applications. Our typical customer starts with a handful of data sources and has the option to integrate data from hundreds of sources. For example, a customer may choose to aggregate and analyze general ledger data from Oracle, human resources data from Workday, billing data from Microsoft, and service management and other operational data from HP, VMware and ServiceNow, although they have the capability to capture data from significantly more sources. Our database preserves historical context of the data, and easily tracks and adapts to changing technology and policy requirements and IT complexity. 
 Standard IT Operating Model and Taxonomy. Our platform is underpinned by a flexible framework that provides a standard model for how IT costs are captured, categorized and allocated to IT services and business services. While we allow our customers to modify this framework, we encourage customers to adopt the Apptio TBM Unified Model, or ATUM, our standardized cost and operational model. ATUM is the first of its kind in our industry. This model was developed in conjunction with the TBM Council’s efforts to establish standards for TBM, including common taxonomies, frameworks and benchmarks that organize and translate IT costs, operational data and other metrics into IT and business perspectives. We believe that ATUM is a strategic advantage and will be an important element to broaden the market for TBM solutions and accelerate market adoption. 
 Visual Modeling and Powerful Calculation Engine. Our visual modeling capabilities allow users to intuitively build and manage the financial and operational model of their IT organization. The powerful calculation 
 4


engine in our platform then allows the models to be applied across very large data sets accessible to users through the analytics capabilities included in our applications. Our platform, modeling capabilities and calculation engine can be applied to IT business services and to non-IT enterprise business services, such as legal, human resources and facilities. 
 Intuitive, Self-Service Analytics. Our analytics interface is powerful, yet easy to use by a broad range of IT and business users. Our solutions enable analysis, scenario modeling and planning with intuitive data visualization. Our analytics can be applied to infrastructure modernization, vendor consolidation, application rationalization, cloud decisions, personnel costs and business services. Our solutions enable users to start with a high level view such as costs and utilization allocated across major categories, such as compute, application, storage, network and cloud. The user may then drill through various levels of detail — such as fully burdened costs by application — all the way to a single line item cost in a monthly bill for a given application. 
 Modular Applications. Our platform currently includes five SaaS applications that can be deployed in a modular fashion. This approach allows customers to realize a rapid time to value and also provides us with a significant opportunity to sell additional applications. Customers gain rapid return on investment from our solutions by making data-driven decisions allowing them to shift expenses from running the business to transforming the business, or by automating processes that the IT organization is currently performing manually. Our applications are: 

• | Cost Transparency. The Cost Transparency application allows customers to understand their enterprise’s IT costs to drive better and faster resource investment decisions. Our Cloud Cost Management offering in the Cost Transparency application family enables customers to understand and plan their public cloud investments.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | IT Benchmarking. The IT Benchmarking application enables customers to see how they compare with their peers and share this information within their organization.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Business Insights. The Business Insights application enables customers to optimize their IT investments by better understanding the value to the enterprise of such investments and what drives that value.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Bill of IT. The Bill of IT application allows IT leaders to communicate the IT costs attributable to each business partner and to empower each business partner to be a better consumer of IT by giving the partner choices that help reduce and recover costs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | IT Planning. The IT Planning application allows IT finance and budget owners to plan more effectively and confidently, align faster with financial plans and business priorities, and hold budget owners accountable with variance analysis.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Data Aggregation and Benchmarking. As a cloud-based solution serving many customers and industry verticals, we are uniquely positioned to capture data across our customer base, forming a new source of IT-specific business data. We also license additional data from third parties to enable our benchmarking offerings. Over time, our customers will benefit from aggregated anonymized benchmarking data providing additional performance insights based on peer groups by industry, business size and geography. We expect to offer our benchmarking data to platform customers and others to drive additional growth and advance our position as a TBM thought leader. 
Benefits of Our Solutions 
 Our Technology Business Management solutions deliver the following benefits: 
 Increase the Value of IT. Our solutions deliver transparency and actionable insights to IT leaders, enabling them to manage IT in the context of the business. This allows IT professionals to strategically align with C-level executives and other business leaders to deliver positive business contributions. As a result, our solutions enable IT leaders to change their IT organizations from a reactive cost center to a proactive service provider, and increase the return on business investments through initiatives such as application rationalization and infrastructure optimization. 
 Understand and Communicate IT Costs. Our solutions provide IT and business leaders with a business system of record that gives a comprehensive, transparent and up-to-date view of the costs of IT services associated 
 5


with specific business functions and services. With this insight, IT leaders can work with business leaders to evaluate different IT options, such as cloud versus owned infrastructure, and custom-built or purchased versus SaaS applications, and make better, data-driven decisions. 
 Optimize IT Investments to Drive Better Business Results. Our solutions enable IT professionals to more efficiently manage existing IT investments and focus incremental effort and spend on innovating and expanding technology investments where they can drive the most value for the business. IT professionals can also leverage value-added insight from benchmarking in order to better understand and optimize asset and service utilization and cost. In addition, unlike initiatives based on the advice of consultants or laborious, internally developed legacy business processes held together by spreadsheets, that are too expensive or time consuming to undertake regularly, our solutions, with their dynamic analytics, key performance indicators, and benchmarking capabilities, allow professionals to optimize investments on an ongoing basis. 
 Plan IT Investments. IT professionals can collaborate with the business to understand their demand for IT services, and then plan efficiently and predictably to meet these demands. For example, customers can model various scenarios with various complexity, such as how costs associated with a single application priced on a per-user basis with multiple pricing bands would change if a business unit added more users, or what would the effect be if the business took multiple applications from one or more vendors and aggregated various levels of usage across the enterprise. 
 Transform IT into a Service Provider. Our solutions enable IT to be delivered as a service regardless of whether it is provided by internal resources, cloud providers or other external service providers. Using our solutions, IT leaders can provide transparency into total and unit costs of alternatives and are able to correlate costs to expected value. This empowers business leaders with real, data-driven choices to better align IT and business objectives. 
 Our Growth Strategy 
 We are pursuing the following strategies to grow our business: 
 Expand Our Customer Base. We believe the market for TBM solutions is large, growing and under-penetrated. We intend to leverage our strong brand, leadership position, high-profile customer base from a wide range of industries and experienced sales team to target customers with a wide range of IT spend and across industries. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 440 customers and we believe there are tens of thousands of potential customers worldwide with an annual IT spend in excess of $10 million that could benefit from our solutions.
 Further Maximize Our Existing Customer Base. Many customers initially subscribe for a subset of the applications we offer so they can realize rapid time to value by reducing costs or shifting technology investments to where they will be most productive. We seek to generate additional revenue from customers by selling subscriptions to other existing or newly developed applications, and expanding the use of our solutions to additional business units. 
 Continue to Foster the IT Leader Community. We will continue to support the TBM Council and leverage our leadership position in a large and growing IT leader community to increase awareness and adoption of TBM solutions. Our relationship with the TBM Council helps us introduce a growing body of CIOs and other leaders to the advantages of TBM and to our solutions, and continues to create a network effect as members exchange information, ideas and experiences with TBM.
 Continue to Deliver Innovative Products. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in product development to enhance the capabilities of our existing applications and expand the number of applications on our extensible platform to address customers’ evolving needs. For example, we launched our IT Financial Management Foundation product in July 2017, to help finance leaders produce accurate budgets in partnership with technology leaders, and in November 2017 we introduced Cloud Cost Management, our new cloud spend optimization offering.

Leverage Our Unique Position to Deliver Valuable Benchmarking Data. Over time, we believe there will be substantial opportunities to leverage our large, unique and growing aggregated data set by embedding data insights in our solutions, or by selling data to customers or third parties on a standalone basis.
 Expand Internationally. We have a growing presence in Europe and Australia. We believe that there is significant opportunity for our TBM solutions outside of the United States and we intend to expand our direct sales force and third-party relationships to further penetrate these and other regions. 
 Expand into Enterprise Business Management. Many shared services groups, such as legal, facilities and human resources, face similar challenges to IT in making data-driven decisions and lack a software solution to help them do so. We currently have several customers utilizing our solutions in legal, facilities and other shared services functions, and to analyze unit costs of various offerings or transactions outside of shared services, and we believe a substantial market exists for enterprise business management outside of the IT organization.
Applications and Technology  
 Applications 
 We have built a suite of cloud-based TBM applications that run on our platform. We currently offer five applications that can be deployed in a modular fashion, with the following core capabilities and features: 
 Cost Transparency. The Cost Transparency application allows customers to understand their enterprises’ IT costs to drive better and faster resource investment decisions. This understanding is accomplished by putting actionable, current, and trusted information about IT costs at the fingertips of the decision-makers. The Cost Transparency application translates raw financial and IT data into an automated sub-ledger model for IT finance, coupled with real-time and intuitive analytics. IT organizations can then use this information to leverage the best practices in the ATUM standard, or a customized model to ensure that the IT leaders’ cost and key performance indicator, or KPI, categories are directly relevant to the IT business owners. Our Cloud Cost Management offering in the Cost Transparency application family enables customers to understand and plan their public cloud investments both separately and as part of their overall IT spending. By understanding IT costs, IT organizations can replace assumption and emotion with defensible facts. 
 IT Benchmarking. The IT Benchmarking application enables customers to see how they compare with their peers and share this information within their organization. IT Benchmarking extends the Cost Transparency application by surfacing side-by-side peer benchmarks beside the customer’s actual KPIs. With IT Benchmarking, customers can evolve their costing monthly via the Cost Transparency application and iteratively improve their data quality and completeness. The data that informs our benchmarking application is global and spans 23 industries. The data is based on real engagements, and peer costs are calculated via consistent cost structures. Today, we utilize a combination of third-party data and our own aggregated data to enable our benchmarking offerings. ATUM normalizes data and enables IT leaders to make actionable apples-to-apples comparisons of their monthly actual costs against a database of current benchmarks from relevant peer organizations. 
 Business Insights. The Business Insights application enables customers to optimize their IT investments by better understanding the value to the enterprise of such investments and what drives that value. Business Insights does this by correlating operational IT data, such as capacity, performance and utilization, with financial data provided by the Cost Transparency application. The Business Insights application provides additional insights that enable IT organizations to automate the ongoing measurement and tracking of key metrics on the utilization, performance and quality of IT products and services delivered. It also allows IT organizations to measure the financial impact of changes in performance and utilization so IT leaders can improve and demonstrate efficiency, justify new investments and accelerate decisions. It enables customers to accelerate initiatives and business cases for investment, drive greater efficiency, facilitate better conversations between IT and the business, and improve IT consumption behavior by the business. 
 Bill of IT. The Bill of IT application allows IT organizations to communicate the IT costs attributable to business partners in the enterprise, and to empower business partners to be better consumers of IT by giving the partner choices that help reduce and recover costs. The Bill of IT application does this by leveraging the information 
 7


rendered from the Cost Transparency application or other data sources to create and deliver an internal invoice for the IT services consumed by the recipient. The Bill of IT application enables IT cost reporting through a simple but interactive “bill” template that allows IT leaders to provide budget, cost, price-based or hybrid bills to their business partners. This then enables cost recovery and unit rate analysis. It shows IT consumption by business units, departments, and users, and provides business-controlled demand levers, such as usage, headcount, and actual or planned consumption. The application also provides “what-if” modeling to collaborate on cost reduction. 
 IT Planning. The IT Planning application automates planning of IT within a single source via a collaborative workflow resource for IT finance and budget owners so these teams can plan more effectively and confidently. The IT Planning application does this by automating, centralizing, and simplifying any budget, forecast and variance tracking processes in a manner that is purpose-built for the IT finance function and budget owner. The application enables automated baseline budget creation, roll-up of budget requests, and flexible approval hierarchies. IT Planning incorporates IT specific planning capabilities, and shifts the process from that of managing spreadsheet logistics to consulting and guiding the business. 
 Technology 
 ATUM. We developed ATUM, in conjunction with the TBM Council to provide a standardized TBM model utilizing industry-endorsed best practices. Without a standard methodology, organizations face the task of how to combine finance and IT data and develop a framework that accurately represents the cost and operations of IT. 
 Organizations that adopt ATUM can realize better alignment between IT, finance and the rest of the business by having a common language about the IT operating structure and work with the confidence that they have embraced industry best practices. This approach offers easier, more frequent comparisons of performance with peers via ATUM-aligned benchmarking, reducing the challenge of peer comparability that is a significant impediment to historical benchmarking approaches. Importantly, our applications are built to the latest ATUM standards to enable rapid adoption within our customers and have the adaptability to evolve the model over time as IT practices change. 
 There are three core elements of ATUM: 
  
• | Data: Enables organizations to source the data elements, formats, and relationships needed by the model.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Taxonomy: Provides a way to organize components of key IT operational functions into standard management categories for consistency and comparability.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Model: Prescribes standard costing and allocation rules to apportion costs to IT categories to ensure alignment with industry best practices.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proven, Scalable Technology Foundation 
 Our solutions are built on an innovative and highly adaptive foundation of modern technologies. 
 Purpose-Built Platform. Our powerful platform is built to enable TBM applications. It provides integrated data ingestion and management, cost analytics and visualization capabilities. Each element was designed and built specifically for TBM applications with end-to-end optimization providing the highest levels of scalability, while maintaining high levels of performance and reliability. Our platform includes an integrated visual design experience, which makes its modeling capabilities accessible to non-technical users. Our platform is also highly configurable and extensible, making it customizable for a variety of uses, evaluations and models, able to integrate other third-party solution providers, and enables our customers to manage the rapid pace of change in the technology market. 
 Data Ingestion. Our solutions can easily ingest data from wide variety of disparate sources, including financial, budget, HR, asset management, project management, service desk, monitoring and provisioning systems, as well as from vendor and cloud provider billing systems. We can ingest data through a direct connection between our solutions and the vendor’s solution, through a customer’s extract, transform and load infrastructure or by ingesting a file, which may be as simple as a flat file exported from the relevant system and imported into our 
 8


solution. While we have relationships with many key vendors in the technology ecosystem to facilitate data ingestion, our solutions are not dependent on those relationships. 
 Automated Data Management. Our platform integrates innovative technologies that greatly ease the cleansing, transformation and mapping process for source data. Our platform persists all source data, intrinsically versions all data and models, and can index to any point of time. This allows our customers to effectively rewind to points in time with full fidelity. Our journal-based architecture provides both auditability and granular rollback of individual transactions and actions in the system. 
 Calculation Engine. Our in-memory calculation engine optimizes calculations allowing for high levels of scalability, performance and interactivity. This enables our customers to benefit from high performance for the most complex models with large data sets updated on a regular basis. This calculation engine is designed to scale-up, by increasing resources on a given machine, and scale-out, by deploying work across multiple machines, to increase performance without impacting the customer’s user experience. 
 Proven Scalability. Our platform has proven its capacity to scale to enterprises representing some of the largest IT budgets in the world, while being leveraged for much smaller customers. Our platform can scale calculations or components of work across multiple servers. Through this infrastructure we are able to provide a consistent and highly interactive application experience up through customer solutions at multi-terabyte scale. 
 Security. We employ a number of technologies, policies and procedures to protect customer data and utilize data centers and services that that have SSAE 16 or ISO 27001 attestations or equivalent attestations. 
 Shared and Dedicated Services. Our platform and applications combine shared and dedicated services, to provide the best performance for our applications while also optimizing our cost to deliver. 
 Portable. Our platform and applications are portable across hosting environments. Our solutions can run in co-located data centers and public cloud environments, which provides us with flexibility in deployment of our solutions. 
 Other Technology Components. We utilize industry standard development environments and programming languages. We broadly utilize Java-based environments and JavaScript. We utilize standard database technologies where applicable, including MySQL. Our software is deployed on virtual server instances running on industry standard servers, networking and storage. 
 TBM Council 
 The TBM Council is a non-profit entity that promotes interaction, learning, and the development and improvement of standards and best practices to members, many of which dovetail with our solutions. Our relationship with the TBM Council helps us introduce a growing body of CIOs and other leaders to the advantages of TBM and our solutions, creating a network effect as members exchange information, ideas and experiences with TBM. Our relationship with the TBM Council also enabled development of ATUM, our standardized cost and operational model for the business of IT, which is the first of its kind in our industry. We consider this relationship an important growth catalyst for the TBM category and our business 
 In an effort to further our and the industry’s understanding of TBM, we formed the TBM Council in April 2012 as a nonprofit professional organization dedicated to advancing TBM. We are deeply invested in the TBM Council and committed to its future success. We are the founding member of the TBM Council, we serve as its technical advisor, and our chief marketing officer is a member of its board of directors. Since its inception, we have invested significant financial and operational resources in the TBM Council’s growth. As a result of our relationship with the TBM Council’s finances and corporate governance, we consolidate the operations of the TBM Council into our financial statements. 
 Today, the TBM Council has become the leading community for CIOs, IT leaders and IT finance professionals dedicated to advancing the discipline of managing the business of IT, with over 4,500 members as of 
 9


December 31, 2017, and a board of directors comprised of IT thought leaders from some of the world’s most respected companies. The TBM Council hosts an annual TBM Conference in the U.S. plus two international conferences to explore best practices that produce greater value, align IT with business goals, and deliver TBM breakthroughs. 
 We believe that the future success of our business depends upon the development and adoption of the market for TBM. The TBM Council provides an opportunity for IT leaders to be introduced to standards and best practices of TBM and accelerates adoption of our TBM solutions in the market. In addition, we believe that the wide-spread adoption of TBM standards promulgated by the TBM Council will help to broaden the market for TBM solutions to companies with a wider range of annual IT spend, and drive customer adoption of ATUM. 
 Customers 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 440 customers. We have customers in a wide variety of industries, including financial services, professional services, technology, energy, consumer goods, manufacturing, healthcare, media, retail and transportation. Multiple companies or divisions within a single consolidated enterprise that each have a separate paid subscription for our applications are each treated as a separate customer. Typically, our customer subscription contracts have a one- to three-year term and provide for the purchase of certain applications or capabilities being subscribed for by our customers. For 2017, 2016 and 2015, no single customer represented more than 10% of our revenue. 
 Since inception, we have invested heavily in our professional services organization to help ensure that customers successfully deploy and adopt our applications. We believe that the success of our customers is critical to the success of our overall business and therefore we have continued to expand our professional services and partner ecosystem. We actively engage with our existing customer base to assess whether our customers are satisfied and realizing the benefits from our solutions. While these efforts often require a substantial commitment and upfront costs, we believe our investment in professional services will create opportunities to expand our customer relationships over time. In addition, we have made substantial investments to drive increased customer adoption of our solutions and of ATUM. We believe that our efforts to develop more standardized applications will enable us to provide our TBM solutions to a broader set of organizations while reducing the per customer investment required to promote success. For 2017, 2016 and 2015, we derived 18%, 19% and 23%, respectively, of total revenue from professional services. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We sell substantially all of our applications through our direct sales organization. Our direct sales team is comprised of inside sales and field sales personnel who are organized by geography, account size, and role. We generate customer leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs, through our strategic relationships and by our participation in the TBM Council. Our marketing programs target technology professionals and senior business leaders. Our principal marketing programs include: 

• | recommendations from key customers;
--+------------------------------------


• | field marketing events for customers and prospects;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | sales development representatives who respond to incoming leads to convert them into new sales opportunities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | participation in, and sponsorship of, TBM Council conferences;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | integrated marketing campaigns, including direct e-mail, online web advertising, blogs and webinars;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | public relations, analyst relations and social media initiatives;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cooperative marketing efforts with partners, including joint press announcements, joint trade show activities, channel marketing campaigns and joint seminars; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | use of our website to provide application and company information, as well as learning opportunities for potential customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 10


We have also developed go-to-market partnerships with a number of key technology, system integrator and consultant partners, both domestically and internationally, to help customers and potential customers validate our solutions and provide introductions to potential customers, and in some cases to resell our software services, or provide professional services related to our solutions. We anticipate that we will continue to develop a select number of third-party relationships to help grow our business. 
 Competition 
 The market for TBM solutions is relatively new and rapidly evolving. In many cases, our primary competition is legacy business processes held together by spreadsheets by our prospective customers. Occasionally we encounter either custom software developed in-house or by consultants, or legacy solutions such as ERP or business intelligence solutions repurposed by in-house IT and finance departments of our potential customers to meet specific business needs. Our competitors also include larger companies, such as ServiceNow, that provide a suite of products and services, a few niche vendors that provide subsets of TBM capabilities, and several specialized companies that currently target the TBM market through solutions that are tailored to a specific TBM use case or industry. Service management software vendors and others in adjacent segments also have solutions that offer a subset of TBM capabilities, generally targeted around their core offerings. We have ongoing partnerships with many of these vendors and many customers ingest IT finance and operational data from products these vendors provide. 
 We believe the principal factors affecting a company’s competitive advantage as a provider of TBM solutions include the following: 
  
• | platform reliability and availability;
--+---------------------------------------


• | ease of use;
--+-------------


• | the use of customer data to drive the information provided in TBM solutions, including benchmarking;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | breadth of applications, product features and capabilities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | focus on, and expertise in, the TBM market;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | price of products and services;
--+--------------------------------


• | breadth of expertise of sales organization;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | strength of professional services organization;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | independence of the TBM vendor and trustworthiness of information being delivered;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | IT business management expertise and thought leadership;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to attract customers through demonstrated customer successes; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | company size and financial stability of operations.
--+----------------------------------------------------

 We believe that we compete effectively on each of the factors listed above; however, we expect competition to intensify in the future. It is possible that the large software vendors who currently do not have an offering in the TBM category, some of which operate in adjacent product categories today, may in the future bring such a solution to market through product development, acquisitions or other means. In addition, several of our competitors have greater name recognition, much longer operating histories, more and better-established customer relationships, larger sales forces, larger marketing and software development budgets and significantly greater resources than we do. Therefore, it is possible that we may not compete favorably with competitors with respect to certain of the forgoing factors. 
 Data Center Operations 
 We rely heavily on data centers and other technologies and services provided by third parties in order to operate critical functions of our business. We host our applications and serve our customers from multiple redundant data centers in the following geographies: North America, Europe, and Australia. While we procure and operate all infrastructure equipment delivering our applications, the data centers that we use are operated by third parties. In 
 11


addition, some of our platform and applications are delivered using a Virtual Private Cloud infrastructure built on Amazon Web Services, or AWS. 
 Research and Development 
 Our ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to research and development and our ability to introduce new applications, technologies, features and capabilities in a timely manner. Our research and development organization is responsible for design, development, testing and release. Our efforts are focused on developing new products and core technologies and further enhancing the functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of existing solutions. We focus our efforts on anticipating customer demand in bringing new products and new versions of existing products to market in order to remain competitive in the marketplace. 
 Research and development expenses were $40.6 million, $35.5 million and $30.6 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, patent and other intellectual property laws, contractual arrangements, such as assignment, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, and confidentiality procedures and technical measures to gain rights to and protect the technology and intellectual property used in our business. We actively pursue registration of our trademarks and service marks in the United States, Australia, Singapore, and the European Community. 
 As of December 31, 2017, we owned eight issued U.S. patents and 16 pending U.S. patent applications. We also owned eight pending counterpart applications worldwide, including three European Patent Office applications, one Australian patent application and four United Kingdom patent applications. The issued U.S. patents that we own are expected to expire between July 2030 and December 2035. We have sole ownership of all of our U.S. patents and pending U.S. patent applications. 
 Our applications use “open source” software. Open source software is made available to the general public in source code form for use, modification and redistribution on an “as-is” basis under the terms of a non-negotiable license. We also rely on other technology that we license from third parties. Though such third-party technology may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, we believe that alternative technology would be available to us. 
 Our policy is to require employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, and other technology and intellectual property created by them on our behalf and agreeing to protect our confidential information, and all of our key employees and contractors have done so. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our vendors and customers. We also control and monitor access to our software, source code and other proprietary information. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 The legal environment of internet-based businesses is evolving rapidly in the United States and elsewhere. The manner in which existing laws and regulations are applied in this environment, and how they will relate to our business in particular, both in the United States and internationally, is often unclear. For example, we sometimes cannot be certain which laws will be deemed applicable to us given the global nature of our business, including with respect to such topics as data privacy and security, pricing, advertising, taxation, content regulation, and intellectual property ownership and infringement. 
Data Privacy and Security Laws 
 Data privacy and security with respect to the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information, or PII, and other forms of data, continue to be the focuses of worldwide legislation and regulation. We are subject to data privacy and security regulation by data protection authorities in the United States (including the 
 12


states in which we conduct our business) and in other countries where we conduct our business. These regulations include laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, and, in the European Union, the Data Protection Directive and EU member state implementations thereof, which require comprehensive information privacy and security protections for consumers with respect to PII collected about them. The EU also has adopted a General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, to supersede the Data Protection Directive. This regulation, which will become fully effective on May 25, 2018, will cause EU data protection requirements to be more stringent and provide for greater penalties for noncompliance. We post on our website our privacy policies and practices concerning the processing, use and disclosure of PII, and certify adherence to and compliance with the EU – U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Our publication of our Privacy Shield certifications, our privacy policy, and other statements we publish regarding privacy and security may subject us to potential state and federal action if they are found to be deceptive or misrepresentative of our practices. We also may be bound from time to time by contractual obligations, including model contract provisions approved by the European Commission, that impose additional restrictions on our handling of PII. The various privacy and data security legal obligations that apply to us may evolve in a manner that relates to our practices or the features of our applications or platform, and we may need to take additional measures to comply with such changes in legal obligations and to maintain and improve our information security posture in an effort to avoid information security incidents or breaches affecting PII or other sensitive or proprietary data. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 753 full-time employees globally, of which 617 work in the U.S. and 136 work internationally. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or are the subject of a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider out relations with our employees to be good.

Apptio, Inc.
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 Note 1. Description of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 Operations
 Apptio, Inc. or the Company, was incorporated on October 2, 2007 and is headquartered in Bellevue, Washington. The Company develops and sells Technology Business Management, or TBM, solutions. The Company’s cloud-based platform and SaaS applications enable IT leaders to analyze, optimize and plan technology investments, and benchmark their financial and operational performance against peers. The Company operates in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, Canada, France, Singapore and Italy.
Initial Public Offering 
 In September 2016, the Company completed an initial public offering, or IPO, in which the Company sold 6,900,000 shares of its newly-authorized Class A common stock at the initial price to public of $16.00 per share. The Company received net proceeds of $99.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, from sales of its shares in the IPO. Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO, (1) all shares of common stock then outstanding were converted to Class B common stock on a one-for-one basis, (2) common stock warrants then outstanding were converted to warrants to purchase 47,893 shares of Class B common stock on a one-for-one basis, (3) a warrant to purchase 27,321 shares of convertible preferred stock was converted to a warrant to purchase 27,321 shares of Class B common stock, and (4) all shares of convertible preferred stock then outstanding were converted into 18,239,475 shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis, and then reclassified as shares of Class B common stock. See Note 6 for further discussion of Class A and B common stock.
Deferred Offering Costs
 Deferred offering costs of $3.7 million, consisting of legal, accounting and other costs related to the IPO, were reclassified to additional paid-in capital as a reduction of the proceeds upon the closing of our IPO on September 28, 2016.
Principles of Consolidation
 The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
 Accounting Principles
 The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP.
 Use of Estimates
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties
 The Company continues to be subject to the risks and challenges associated with other companies at a similar stage of development, including risks associated with: dependence on key personnel; successful marketing and sale of its solutions and adaptation of such solutions to changing market dynamics and customer preferences; 
 72

Apptio, Inc.
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
 
competition from alternative products and services, including from larger companies that have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more and better established customer relationships and greater resources than the Company; and the ability to raise additional capital to support future growth. Since inception through December 31, 2017, the Company has incurred losses from operations, and accumulated a deficit of $225.9 million, and has been dependent on equity and debt financing to fund operations.
 Operating Segments
 The Company follows the authoritative literature that establishes annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise’s operating segments and related disclosures about its products and services, geographic regions and major customers.
 The Company operates its business as one operating segment. Its chief operating decision makers, or CODMs, are its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The CODMs review separate revenue information for the Company’s subscription and professional services revenue, and all other financial information presented on a consolidated basis, for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance and allocating resources.
 Foreign Currency
 The functional currency of the Company’s international subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. The results of operations for the Company’s international subsidiaries are remeasured from the local currency into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates during each period. The majority of assets and liabilities are remeasured using exchange rates at the end of each period. All equity transactions and certain assets are remeasured using historical rates.
 Comprehensive Loss
 Certain gains and losses are recognized in comprehensive loss, but excluded from net loss. Comprehensive loss includes net loss and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities.
 Cash and Cash Equivalents
 The Company considers all highly liquid investments, including money market investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase, to be cash equivalents.
 Investments
 The Company classifies its investment securities as available-for-sale. Investment securities are stated at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity (deficit). Realized gains and losses and declines in value of securities judged to be other than temporary are included in interest income (expense) and other, net. The cost of investments for purposes of computing realized and unrealized gains and losses is based on the specific identification method. Investments in securities with maturities of less than one year, or where management’s intent is to use the investments to fund current operations, are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities of greater than one year are classified as long-term investments.
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 At December 31, 2017 and 2016 the Company has the following financial instruments: cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
The fair value of the Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable, and certain accrued liabilities approximates their respective carrying amounts. The Company measures its cash equivalents, marketable securities, 
 73

Apptio, Inc.
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
 
and preferred stock warrants using the fair value measurement principles under GAAP, which requires that fair value be based on the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability.
 Fair value principles require disclosures regarding the manner in which fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a three-tiered fair value hierarchy into which these assets and liabilities must be grouped, based upon significant levels of inputs as follows:
  
Level 1 | Observable inputs, such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.

Level 2 | Observable inputs, other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
--------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Level 3 | Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The lowest level of significant input determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy. Management’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability.
 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
 The Company performs initial and ongoing evaluations of its customers’ financial positions, and generally extends credit on account, without collateral. The Company determines the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon various factors, including past collection experience, credit quality of the customer, age of the receivable balance, and current economic conditions.
 If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances might be required. Accounts are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once collection efforts are unsuccessful.
 Activity within the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows (in thousands):
 
 
 | December 31, | 
-------------------------------+--------------+----
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | | 2015
Balance at beginning of period | $ | 122 | | $ | 289 | | $ | 450 |

Write-offs | | — | | | (74 | ) | | (158 | )
Balance at end of period | $ | 413 | | $ | 122 | | $ | 289 | 

Concentration of Credit Risk
 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash accounts with financial institutions where, at times, deposits exceed federal insurance limits. The Company has credit risk regarding trade accounts receivable. No individual customer represented more than 10% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2017 or 2016. No individual customer represented more than 10% of revenue during 2017, 2016 or 2015.
 Advertising
 Advertising costs are charged to operations as incurred or the first time the advertising takes place, based on the nature of the advertising, and include direct marketing, events, public relations, sales collateral materials and

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
 
partner programs. Advertising expenses were approximately $7.7 million, $7.4 million and $7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 Interest Expense
 Interest expense in 2017 consists of interest on capital leases. In 2016 and 2015, interest expense consists of interest on capital leases and debt, and fair value adjustments for the Company’s preferred stock warrant liability. No interest was capitalized during 2017, 2016 or 2015.
 Property and Equipment
 Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method and the following estimated useful lives:
 
 
Computer and office equipment | 2-3 years
------------------------------+----------
Software | 1-3 years
Furniture | 3 years 

 
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related asset. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of, and the related accumulated depreciation, is removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
 In 2014, the Company recorded an asset retirement obligation related to certain leased facilities and a corresponding leasehold improvement which is depreciated over the expected term of the lease. The asset retirement obligation in total, and the period over period changes for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, are immaterial to the financial statements.
 Preferred Stock Warrant Liability
 The Company classified its warrants to purchase preferred stock as a liability. The Company adjusted the carrying value of the warrant liability to fair value at the end of each reporting period utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The preferred stock warrant liability was included on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and its warrant revaluation was recorded as interest expense and is included in interest income (expense) and other, net. Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO, the warrant to purchase shares of convertible preferred stock was converted to a warrant to purchase shares of Class B common stock and was no longer classified as a liability on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. On September 26, 2016, the warrant holder exercised the warrant and the Company issued shares of Class B common stock through a cashless exercise of the warrant, in accordance with its terms. See Note 5 for additional information.
 Revenue Recognition
 The Company derives its revenue from two sources: (1) subscription revenue, which is comprised of subscription fees from customers utilizing the Company’s applications, fees for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees, which are referred to as premium support offerings, and fees for subscription based online training offerings; and (2) professional services, which consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of the Company’s applications, as well as fees for in-person training and TBM Council conference registration and sponsorship fees. Implementation and configuration services primarily consist of consultative services, such as data mapping and establishing best practices. Implementation and configuration services do not result in any significant customization or modification of the software platform or user interface. The Company presents revenue from each of these sources separately in its consolidated statements of operations.
 The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are met: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer; (3) the collection of related fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. If collection is 
 75

Apptio, Inc.
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
 
not reasonably assured, the Company defers the revenue recognition until collectability becomes reasonably assured. In addition, in instances where final acceptance of non-standard service deliverables are required before revenue is recognized, revenue and the associated costs are deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. The Company’s arrangements do not contain general rights of return.
 The Company enters into arrangements with multiple deliverables that primarily include subscription and professional services, but may also include premium support, online training and in-person training. The professional services are not considered essential to the functionality of the software. To qualify as a separate unit of accounting, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis. The Company believes its subscription offerings and its professional services offerings have stand-alone value. The Company’s subscriptions have stand-alone value because such services are often sold separately from other professional services. The Company’s professional services have stand-alone value because those services may be sold separately by other vendors and there are trained third-party consultants capable of performing the professional services. Deliverables that are accounted for separately consist of software subscription, professional services, premium support and online and in-person training.
 When arrangements involve multiple elements that qualify as separate units of accounting, the Company allocates revenue to each deliverable in a multiple-deliverable arrangement based upon its relative selling price. The estimated selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy, in order of priority: (1) vender-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available; (2) third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price, if VSOE of selling price is not available; or (3) best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE of selling price is available.
 The Company determines VSOE of selling price based on historical stand-alone sales to customers. In determining VSOE, the Company requires that a substantial majority of the selling prices for its subscription or professional services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range of the applicable median selling price. The Company has not yet been able to establish VSOE for its subscription and professional services because it has not historically priced its service offerings within a sufficiently narrow range. When VSOE cannot be established, the Company applies judgment with respect to whether it can establish a selling price based on TPE. TPE is determined based on third-party prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Generally, the Company’s pricing strategy differs from that of its peers and its services and solutions contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of other offerings with similar functionality cannot be obtained. Furthermore, the Company is unable to reliably determine what similar competitor services’ selling prices are on a stand-alone basis. As a result, the Company uses BESP as the selling price for its services.
 The Company estimates BESP for subscriptions, premium support and online training based on the historical amounts for such deliverables on a stand-alone basis. The BESP for professional services is based on the historical average rate per hour charged, and BESP for in-person training is based on historical amounts on a per-seat basis.
 The Company recognizes revenue for subscription fees from customers utilizing its applications ratably over the subscription term, which are typically one to three years. The Company’s subscription arrangements generally do not allow the customer the contractual right to take possession of the software; as such, the arrangements are considered to be service contracts. Fees for premium support offerings and subscription-based online training are generally one-year agreements billed upfront, and are recognized ratably over the term of the support or training agreement. The Company’s premium support offerings include all of the Company’s standard incident support services, with enhanced response times, dedicated support resources, access to architecture and configuration experts and other services not included with standard support. The Company’s subscription-based online training provides self-directed training for customers via access to recorded training sessions.
 Professional services revenue consists of fees associated with application configuration, integration, change management, education and training services, and conference registration and sponsorship fees. The Company’s professional services engagements are priced either on a time-and-materials basis or on a fixed-fee basis. The duration of the Company’s professional services engagements varies based on the scope of services requested, but typically ranges between three and six months. For time-and-materials arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue as hours are worked. For fixed-fee arrangements, the Company recognizes professional services revenue as delivered using the percentage of completion, or POC, method measured on an hours incurred basis. Under the POC 
 76

Apptio, Inc.
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
 
method of accounting, revenue and expenses are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual hours incurred and total estimated hours at the completion of the project. Changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the project. Estimates of both hours and costs to complete a project are reviewed periodically and the effect of any change in the estimated hours to complete a project is reflected as an adjustment to revenue in the period the change becomes known.
 If current estimated costs to complete a project exceed the revenue allocated to the project, a loss equal to the amount of estimated excess costs will be recognized in the period the change becomes known. The use of the POC method of accounting involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenue, costs and profits, and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods. Associated out-of-pocket travel expenses related to the delivery of professional services are typically reimbursed by the customer. Out-of-pocket expense reimbursements are recognized as revenue and cost of service expense.
 Fees for in-person training are billed in advance of the training and are recognized in the period the training occurs. Conference registration and sponsorship fees are for TBM Council conferences and related TBM Council activities. Registration fees for TBM Council conferences are billed in advance of the conference and are recognized in the period the conference occurs. TBM Council sponsorship fees are paid in advance and are recognized in the period the sponsorship activities occur, or ratably over the contractual period if the sponsorship entails ongoing activities beyond a single event.
 On occasion, the Company sells its subscriptions through third-party resellers. These arrangements typically call for the reseller to retain a portion of the price to the customer as compensation. Since the Company is typically responsible for the acceptability of the services purchased by the customer, the Company is the primary obligor in the transaction and, therefore, records revenue on a gross basis based on the amount billed to the customer. Reseller fees are recognized as sales and marketing expense as incurred.
 Deferred revenue represents the unearned revenue on cash receipts or accounts receivable for the sale of subscriptions and for professional services for which services have not yet been provided. The substantial majority of deferred revenue relates to subscription revenue.
 Research and Development
 Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and primarily include payroll, employee benefits, consulting services, stock-based compensation expense and other headcount-related costs associated with product development and depreciation of equipment used in research and development.
 Capitalized Software Costs
 For development costs related to the Company’s software solutions and internal use software, qualifying internally developed software costs, including payroll and stock-based compensation costs, incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and recorded in property and equipment, net. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. The Company capitalized $0.7 million, $1.1 million and $0.8 million for software development costs during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Stock-based compensation costs included in capitalized software costs and amortization of capitalized software costs were immaterial to the consolidated financial statements for all years presented.Cost Allocation
 The Company allocates certain overhead and information technology operating costs between cost of goods sold, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administration expense based upon the number of employees in the related departments.
 77

Sales Commissions
 The Company pays sales commissions to employees shortly after executing customer agreements related to initial sales and subsequent renewals of all subscriptions and related services. Sales commission obligations are accrued to sales and marketing at the time of the initial sale for the full amount of the contract.
 Income Taxes
 The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. This method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance has been established for the full amount of the net deferred tax assets as the Company has determined that the future realization of the tax benefit is not more likely than not.
 The Company recognizes the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit is measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties on amounts due to taxing authorities as a component of income tax expense.
 The Company’s annual effective tax rate is based on expected income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s annual effective tax rate and in evaluating the Company’s tax positions.
 Stock-Based Compensation
 The Company recognizes expense related to the fair value of stock-based compensation. Compensation cost recognized for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 includes costs for all share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and is recognized using the straight-line attribution method.
 The Company’s stock price volatility and expected option life involve management’s best estimates, both of which impact the fair value of the award calculated under the Black-Scholes option pricing model and, ultimately, the expense that will be recognized over the life of the award. The Company has elected to recognize compensation expense for only the portion of awards expected to vest. Therefore, management applies an estimated forfeiture rate that is derived from historical employee termination behavior. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from these estimates, additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required.
 Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
 In May 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or 
FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2017-09 Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Scope of Modification Accounting. ASU 2017-09 provides clarification on when modification accounting should be used for changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. This ASU does not change the accounting for modifications but clarifies that modification accounting guidance should only be applied if there is a change to the value, vesting conditions, or award classification and would not be required if the changes are considered non-substantive. The Company elected to early adopt this new standard in the second quarter of 2017. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. For public entities, ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this new standard as of January 1, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has accumulated excess tax benefits from temporary differences resulting from the amount and timing of stock-based compensation expense recorded in our financial statements compared to deductions on its income tax return from 
 78

Apptio, Inc.
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
 
the award compensation that reduces the net operating loss deferred tax asset. The Company provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets since it has been determined that it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Upon adoption of this standard, the stock-based compensation excess tax benefit was eliminated, resulting in an increase to the net operating loss deferred tax asset, with a corresponding increase in the valuation allowance. The Company elected to continue to estimate the number of share-based awards expected to vest, rather than electing to account for forfeitures as they occur to determine the amount of stock-based compensation expense to be recognized each period. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
 In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Inter-Entity Transfers of Assets other than Inventory. The guidance requires entities to recognize the income tax impact of an intra-entity sale or transfer of an asset other than inventory when the sale or transfer occurs, rather than when the asset has been sold to an outside party. The guidance will require a modified retrospective application with a cumulative catch-up adjustment to opening retained earnings at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2019, but permits adoption in an earlier period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and the timing of adoption.
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The objective of the update is to improve financial reporting by increasing transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. For public entities, the new standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. For all other entities, the new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and for interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Early application of the amendments is permitted for all entities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on the Company’s financial statements.
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), outlining a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers that supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance with a comprehensive revenue measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements. The standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining customer contracts. For public entities, ASU 2014-09, as amended, is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. For all other entities, the new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and the guidance must be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption.
 The Company is in process of finalizing its assessment of the new standard, including ascribing the appropriate amortization period to the respective commission costs. The Company adopted the requirements of the new standard on January 1, 2018 and will utilize the full retrospective transition method. 
 The impact of adopting this standard on 2017 and 2016 subscription and services revenue is not material. The primary impact of the standard will be the requirement to capitalize certain contract costs, such as commissions, which are currently being expensed as incurred. Because these costs will now be capitalized and amortized over the period benefited by the transaction, the Company expects that adoption of this standard will result in marginally lower sales and marketing expense in scenarios where current period sales results are higher than the prior period sales results. In scenarios where current period sales results are lower than the prior period sales results, the Company expects sales and marketing expenses will be marginally higher than if the Company had expensed these selling costs as incurred. Under the new standard, the Company will defer commission costs to obtain customer subscription contracts and will amortize these costs over a period of benefit that we have determined to be four years for new subscription agreements, and over the term of the respective subscription for renewals of subscription agreements. Commissions on service arrangements will continue to be expensed as incurred as the term for these arrangements is typically less than 12 months. The Company expects this to materially reduce annual sales and marketing expenses.

Note 2. Fair Value Measurements
 The following tables present information about the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that have been measured at fair value as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs utilized to determine such fair value (in thousands):

 | $ | 59,376 | | $ | 33,840 | | $ | 93,216

 
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company utilized the market approach to value its money market mutual funds and U.S. government treasury securities using Level 1 valuation inputs because published net asset values were readily available. The Company’s Level 2 marketable securities are valued using the market approach based on broker or dealer quotations, actual trade data, recent observable transaction information for similar securities, benchmark yields or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency, and include the Company’s investments in U.S. government agency securities and corporate notes and obligations.
 

Note 3. Investments
 Available-for-sale investments consist of fixed-income securities that are accounted for at fair value. Premiums and discounts paid on securities at the time of purchase are recorded as accrued interest and amortized over the period of maturity. The amortized cost and fair value on the available-for-sale investments and unrealized gains and losses as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in thousands):

 | December 31, 2017 | 
----------------------------------------------------+-------------------+-------
 | Amortized | | Gross Unrealized | | | Gross Unrealized | | Fair | 
 | Cost | | Gains | | | Losses | | Value |

Total long-term available-for-sale debt securities | $ | 38,515 | | $ | — | | $ | (69 | ) | $ | 38,446

 
As interest rates increase, those securities purchased at a lower yield show a mark-to-market unrealized loss. The longer the duration of these securities, the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields. The unrealized losses are due primarily to changes in interest rates. The Company regularly reviews investments for other-than-temporary impairment using both qualitative and quantitative criteria. 
 The following table presents gross unrealized losses and fair values for those investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2017, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in thousands):
 
 
 | December 31, 2017 | 
----------------------------------------------------+---------------------+-------
 | Less than 12 months | | 12 months or greater | 
 | Fair Value | | Unrealized Loss | | | Fair Value | | Unrealized Loss
Corporate notes and obligations | $ | 18,873 | | $ | (22 | ) | $ | 3,998 | $ | (3 | )
U.S. government treasury securities | | 24,415 | | | (52 | ) | | 31,466 | | (33 | )
Total short-term available-for-sale debt securities | $ | 43,288 | | $ | (74 | ) | $ | 35,464 | $ | (36 | )

 
The Company did not consider any of the unrealized losses on its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired based on its evaluation of available evidence, which includes the Company’s intent as of December 31, 2017 to hold these investments until the cost basis is recovered. Realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities were immaterial for all periods presented.
 Note 4. Property and Equipment
 
A summary of property and equipment is as follows (in thousands):

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
 

Depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment was $6.1 million, $6.0 million and $6.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company retired $1.5 million and $1.5 million fully depreciated computer and office equipment, respectively. Property and equipment includes $192,000 and $198,000 of capital leases at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Accumulated depreciation of these leased assets was $148,000 and $113,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These leased assets are included in the computer and office equipment category in the table above.
 Note 5. Warrants 
 Common Stock Warrants
 In connection with entering into and amending the senior credit facility, see Note 12, the Company issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 21,208 shares of Class B common stock at an exercise price of $14.31 per share. On September 26, 2016, one of the warrant holders exercised warrants to purchase 10,604 shares of Class B common stock. The remaining warrants to purchase 10,604 shares of Class B common stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2017. 
Convertible Preferred Stock Warrant
 The Company previously issued a warrant to purchase 27,321 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock in conjunction with a loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, at an exercise price of $1.37255 per share. Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO, this warrant was converted to a warrant to purchase 27,321 shares of Class B common stock. On September 26, 2016, the warrant holder exercised the warrant and the Company issued 25,658 shares of Class B common stock through a cashless exercise of the warrant, in accordance with its terms. 
Note 6. Stockholders’ Equity
 Preferred Stock
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had authorized 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001, of which no shares were issued and outstanding.
 Common Stock
 As of December 31, 2017 the Company had authorized 451,000,000 shares of Class A common stock and 44,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, each par value $0.0001 per share, of which 27,402,965 shares and 14,709,981 shares of Class A and Class B common stock, respectively, were issued and outstanding. Holders of Class A and Class B common stock are entitled to one vote per share and ten votes per share, respectively. Each share of Class B common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into one share of Class A common stock. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon transfer, subject to certain exceptions, and upon the earlier of (1) the seventh anniversary of the closing of the IPO, and (2) the date on which the Class B common stock ceases to represent at least 25% of the outstanding common stock. The shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, except for voting and conversion rights. During the year ended December 31, 2017, 16,782,886 shares of Class B common stock were converted into 16,782,886 shares of Class A common stock at the request of the holders thereof.

rights, performance units and performance shares to employees, directors and consultants of the Company and the Company’s subsidiaries’ employees and consultants. As of December 31, 2017, the total number of shares available for issuance under the 2016 Plan was 4,237,746. These available shares will automatically increase each January 1, by the least of 5,500,000 shares of Class A common stock, by 5% of the outstanding shares of all classes of the Company’s common stock as of the last day of the Company’s immediately preceding fiscal year, and such other amount as the Company’s board of directors may determine on or before the last day of the Company’s immediately preceding fiscal year. Pursuant to the above, on January 1, 2018, the number of available shares automatically increased by 2,105,647.
2007 Stock Plan
 The Company granted options under its 2007 stock plan, as amended, or the 2007 Plan, until September 23, 2016, when the plan was terminated in connection with the Company’s IPO. Accordingly, no shares are available for future issuance under this plan. The 2007 Plan continues to govern outstanding equity awards granted thereunder.
2011 Executive Equity Incentive Plan
 The Company granted options under its 2011 executive equity incentive plan as amended, or the 2011 Plan, until September 23, 2016, when the plan was terminated in connection with the Company’s IPO. Accordingly, no shares are available for future issuance under this plan. The 2011 Plan continues to govern outstanding equity awards granted thereunder.
2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
 The Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or 2016 ESPP, became effective on September 21, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the total number of shares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the 2016 ESPP was 821,635 These available shares will automatically increase each January 1, by the least of 1,600,000 shares of Class A common stock, 1% of the number of shares of all classes of the Company’s common stock outstanding on the immediately preceding fiscal year, and such lesser number of shares as determined by the Company’s board of directors. Pursuant to the above, on January 1, 2018, the number of available shares automatically increased by 421,129.
 The 2016 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company’s Class A common stock at a discount through payroll deductions of their eligible compensation, subject to any plan limitations. Except for the initial offering period, the 2016 ESPP provides for separate six-month offering periods beginning November 30 and May 31 of each fiscal year. The initial offering period ran from September 23, 2016 through May 31, 2017. The initial offering period included the employee enrollment period, which ran from September 23, 2016 to November 10, 2016, at which time employee deductions commenced.
 On each purchase date, eligible employees will purchase the Company’s Class A common stock at a price per share equal to 85% of the lesser of (1) the fair market value of the Company’s Class A common stock on the first trading day of the offering period, and/or (2) the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the purchase date.
 Stock Options
 Stock options are exercisable at a price equal to the market value of the underlying shares of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant as determined by the Company’s board of directors or, for those stock options issued subsequent to the IPO, the closing price of the Company’s common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Market on the date of grant. Stock options granted under the 2016 Plan, 2011 Plan and the 2007 Plan generally vest 25% one year from the date the requisite service period begins and continue to vest monthly for each month of continued employment over the remaining three years. Options granted generally are exercisable for a period of up to 10 years.

Exercisable at December 31, 2017 | | 4,935 | | | $ | 8.74 | | | | 5.53 | | $ | 72,930

 The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of options granted during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $5.94, $5.73 and $6.05, respectively. The total fair value of shares vested during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $11.6 million, $8.3 million and $7.6 million, respectively.
 The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $38.5 million, $2.9 million and $5.4 million, respectively. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company received $21.9 million, $1.3 million and $2.7 million, respectively, from exercises of stock options. Shares are issued from plan reserves upon exercise.
 The fair value of stock options granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:
  
 | Years Ended December 31, | 
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 
Dividend yield | | 0.0% | | 0.0% | | 0.0%
Risk-free interest rate | 1.8% - 2.1% | | 1.1% - 2.1% | | 1.3% - 2.0% 
Expected life | 4.1 - 5.6 | | 5.6 - 7.9 | | 5.0 - 6.1 
Expected volatility | 33.3% - 35.4% | | 37.4% - 42.4% | | 38.9% - 47.0%

 The weighted-average volatility used in the fair value calculations of option grants for 2017, 2016 and 2015, was 34.7%, 38.9% and 42.7%, respectively.
 The Company has not declared or paid any dividends. The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model is based on the implied yield available at the time of the option grant in U.S. Treasury securities at maturity with a term equivalent to the expected life of the option. Expected volatility is based on an average volatility of stock prices for a group of publicly traded companies with similar software product offerings. The expected life of options represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. Consideration was given to the contractual terms of the stock-based awards, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. Prior to the IPO, given the absence of an active market for the Company’s common stock, the Company’s board of directors was required to estimate the fair value of the Company’s common stock at the time of each option grant based on several factors, including consideration of input from management and contemporaneous third-party valuations. These valuations include consideration of enterprise value and assessment of other common and convertible preferred stock transactions occurring during the period. Subsequent to the completion of the IPO, the Company uses the market-closing price for the Company’s Class A common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Market.

As of December 31, 2017, there was a total of $14.9 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based compensation associated with options granted under the 2007, 2011 and 2016 Plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining expected term of 2.3 years
 RSUs
 RSU activity under the 2016 Plan during the year ended December 31, 2017 was as follows (in thousands, except per share data):

RSUs granted under the 2016 Plan generally vest 25% one year from the date the requisite service period begins and continue to vest quarterly for each quarter of continued employment over the remaining three years. The aggregate grant date fair value of RSUs granted in 2017 and 2016 was $27.8 million and $10.4 million, respectively.
 
We recognized $5.3 million of stock-based compensation associated with RSUs during the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, total unrecognized compensation cost, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, related to unvested RSUs was approximately $28.8 million and weighted-average remaining vesting period was 3.3 years.

Note 8. Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders
 The Company calculates basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders in conformity with the two-class method required for companies with participating securities. The Company considers all series of convertible preferred stock to be participating securities. Under the two-class method, the net loss attributable to common stockholders is not allocated to the convertible preferred stock as the holders of convertible preferred stock do not have a contractual obligation to share in losses.
 The diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period. For purposes of this calculation, convertible preferred stock, options to purchase common stock and warrants to purchase common stock and convertible preferred stock are considered common stock equivalents, but have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as their effect is antidilutive. Basic and diluted net loss per share was the same for each period presented, as the inclusion of all potential common shares outstanding would have been antidilutive.
 The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share (in thousands, except per share data):

Note 9. Income Taxes
 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. The Company has estimated the provision for income taxes in accordance with the Tax Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing, and as a result recorded a reduction of $30.0 million in its deferred tax assets, which is entirely offset by its valuation allowance resulting in zero total tax expense in the period in which the legislation was enacted. The provisional amount related to the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, was $30.0 million. The provisional amount related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was $0.7 million based on cumulative foreign earnings of $5.5 million.
 On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, or SAB 118, was issued to address the application of GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. Additional work is necessary for a more detailed analysis of the deferred tax assets and liabilities and the Company’s historical foreign earnings as well as potential correlative adjustments. Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to current tax expense in the quarter of 2018 when the analysis is complete.
 The components of loss before provision for income taxes were as follows (in thousands):

 | $ | 561 | | $ | 452 | | $ | 109 | 

 
The reconciliation of the statutory rate of 34% and the Company’s effective rate of -2.24% is driven primarily by effects of the Tax Act, increased tax deductions related to stock compensation, and change in the relative amounts of income earned in foreign jurisdictions.
 At December 31, 2017, the Company has U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $207.9 million, which may be used to offset future taxable income. The carryforwards expire in years ranging from 2028 through 2036. Carryforwards of net operating losses are subject to possible limitation should a change in ownership of the Company occur, as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 382.

The Company has established a full valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset balance due to the uncertainty of future realization of the net deferred tax assets.
 The net change in the total valuation allowance was as follows (in thousands):

Balance at end of period | $ | (59,270 | ) | | $ | (68,052 | ) | $ | (58,542 | )

 
The calculation of the Company’s tax obligations involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations. ASC 740, Income Taxes, provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits. The Company has assessed its income tax positions and recorded tax benefits for all years subject to examination, based upon its evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at each period end. For those tax positions where the Company has determined there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is determined there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized.
 Although the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for its uncertain tax positions, it can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. As the Company expands internationally, it will face increased complexity, and its unrecognized tax benefits may increase in the future. The Company makes adjustments to its reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the

amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
 The total balance of unrecognized gross tax benefits was as follows (in thousands):

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and internationally in the United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, France, Canada, Australia, Singapore and Italy. As of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, there is no accrued interest or penalties associated with income taxes recorded in the consolidated financial statements. The 2011 through 2017 tax years are open to review by taxing authorities.
 

Note 10. Segments
 The Company operates its business as one operating segment. Its chief operating decision makers, or CODMs, are its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The CODMs review separate revenue information for the Company’s subscription and professional services revenue, and all other financial information presented on a consolidated basis, for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance and allocating resources.

Apptio, Inc.
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
 
Legal Matters
 From time to time, the Company has become involved in claims and other legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company investigates these claims as they arise. Although claims are inherently unpredictable, the Company is currently not aware of any matters that may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows, individually or in the aggregate. The Company accrues estimates for resolution of legal and other contingencies when losses are probable and estimable. As of December 31, 2017, the Company does not believe that any material losses relating to claims were probable and estimable, and therefore has not recorded a reserve for any material contingencies.
Note 12. Credit Facilities
 On April 20, 2016, the Company amended a revolving credit agreement, or the senior credit facility, with Silicon Valley Bank. The Company was able to incur revolver borrowings on a borrowing base tied to the amount of eligible accounts receivable, not to exceed $15.0 million, under the senior credit facility. The revolver matured and expired on June 16, 2017 with no amounts outstanding. The senior credit facility was not renewed and, therefore, the Company has no active credit facilities.
Note 13. Subsequent Events
 On February 2, 2018, the Company acquired all outstanding membership interests of Digital Fuel SV, LLC, or Digital Fuel. The Company acquired Digital Fuel to extend its leadership of the Technology Business Market and broaden the Company’s customer base. The Company’s accounting and analysis of this transaction is pending completion. The total estimated consideration for Digital Fuel was $42.5 million, comprised of $38.3 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments provided for in the Purchase Agreement, and 176,406 shares of Apptio’s Class A common stock.
