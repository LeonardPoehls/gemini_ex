Item 1. Description of Business.
Our Background.  CrowdGather, Inc. formerly WestCoast Golf Experiences, Inc., (the “Company,” “we” or “CrowdGather”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 20, 2005.
 
On April 2, 2008, the Company, General Mayhem LLC (“General”) and the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, General Mayhem Acquisition Corp. (the “Acquisition Subsidiary”), closed the agreement and plan of merger, pursuant to which General merged into the Acquisition Subsidiary, with the Acquisition Subsidiary surviving, and each share of General was converted into and became one (1) share, such that former members of General were issued 26,000,000, or approximately 64.9%, of the outstanding shares at that time. Immediately thereafter, the Acquisition Subsidiary merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving, and the Company changed its name to CrowdGather, Inc.

On May 19, 2014, we closed the Agreement and Plan of Merger with Plaor, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Plaor”) and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Plaor Acquisition Corp., pursuant to which Plaor Acquisition Corp. merged with Plaor and Plaor survived as our wholly-owned subsidiary (“Merger”). Pursuant to the Merger, the shareholders of Plaor received 55,075,800 shares of common stock of CrowdGather .
 
Recent Developments.
 On March 18, 2016, we sold our subsidiary Plaor, Inc. (“Plaor”) to Native Games America, LLC (“NGA”).  The terms outlined included a cash payment of $200,000, the assumption of approximately $1,800,000 of CrowdGather, Inc debt, approximately $500,000 of Plaor, Inc. debt. The balance, approximately $974,000, is in the form of deferred payments beginning May 2017 in six equal monthly payments. Total consideration offered was in aggregate $3,500,000. At close of the transaction on March 18, 2016, NGA assumed $1,848,000 of debt and accrued interest, $589,000 of outstanding liabilities and made cash payments of $200,000 to the Company and cash payments on behalf of Ploar to settle liabilities of $284,000. The balance was note receivable of $731,000. Based on discussion with the management of NGA we impaired the balance in note receivable on our balance sheet to $0. See Note 4 of the financial statements.
 
The Company was current in all of its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission through April, 2016 and on October 31, 2016, the Company filed a Form 15-12G terminating its filing requirements with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Our Business. CrowdGather operates a media network of forum and online communities focused on a broad number of vertical interests, as well as social casino games.  Following the merger with Plaor we began to operate a social casino game available free to play on Facebook, iOS, and Android. Subsequent to the sale of our Plaor subsidiary, we are no longer active in the gaming sector.  We continue to focus on pursuing opportunities to improve and increase monetization of our consolidated media network as well as opportunities to evolve our holdings by focusing more on the cannabis vertical which will allow for us to have more predictable growth due to the rate at which this segment of the economy is growing. We initially entered the digital cannabis space with the acquisition of WeedTracker.com, an online community forum dedicated to the cannabis industry in 2015. Going forward, we will launch other cannabis communities as well as leveraging our existing free forum building software to allow users to create their own cannabis themed communities. In this way we will continue the initial mission CrowdGather was formed for which was to ‘gather’ a large crowd of online enthusiasts, but with an emphasis on moving away from the diverse verticals we currently service so that we can gain significant leverage by focusing primarily on the online cannabis space.  Additionally, when funding permits it, we intend to ‘gather’ the crowd offline through the launch of cannabis themes coworking spaces beginning when our current lease is up in November 2016.  By consolidating all of our efforts into the burgeoning cannabis vertical, we hope to generate enough free cash flow to then leverage our capital into other attractive cannabis related acquisitions and opportunities.
 
Our forum business specializes in monetizing a network of online forums and message boards designed to engage, provide information to and build community around users. We are in the process of building what we hope will become an important social, advertising and user generated content network by consolidating existing groups of online users who post on message boards and forums. Our goal is to create superb user experiences for forum communities and world class service offerings for forum owners. We believe that the communities built around message boards and forums are one of the most dynamic sources of information available on the web because forums are active communities built around interest and information exchange on specific topics.
 
Our network is comprised of two types of forum communities: branded and hosted communities that are built on one of our forum hosting platforms.  The branded communities, such as Pocketables.com and Digishoptalk.com, are wholly owned by us and we monetize them through a combination of text and display ads.  The hosted communities comprise the majority of our revenues, traffic, and page views, and are built upon one of our leading forum hosting platforms - Yuku.com and Freeforums.org.  We monetize the web traffic on these sites through a combination of Internet advertising mediums at our discretion in exchange for providing free software, support and hosting.  In some instances, we may derive subscription revenues in lieu of or in addition to advertising revenue because the site administrator has decided to pay monthly fees in exchange for providing an ad-free experience and other services for their members.  Our goal is to ultimately build an advertising network that allows us to leverage the targeted demographics of the combined network in order to generate the highest advertising rates for all of our member sites.
 
Our Community of Online Forums. Our forum community connects what we believe is a robust and vibrant network of people sharing their questions, expertise and experiences. We hope that this collection of forums will help users easily access relevant, dynamic, and compelling user-generated content, conversations and commerce.

Digital Cannabis.  We strive to operate in the rapidly evolving and highly regulated cannabis industry that, as has been estimated by some, will exceed $30 billion by the year 2020.  Historically, we have been and will continue to be aggressive in executing acquisitions and other opportunities that we believe will benefit us in the long-term. Going forward, we intend to refine our focus towards adding more digital cannabis related assets to our portfolio while also developing a cannabis coworking business where we will offer flexible office rental plans to entrepreneurs focused on building and growing their cannabis related businesses.
 
In April, 2015 we acquired an online discussion community—WeedTracker.com— devoted to users and vendors in the cannabis sector. As a discussion site that in no way deals with the sales of cannabis, we believe weedtracker.com is not engaged in activities which violate Federal law. WeedTracker has been in operation longer than most major cannabis sites currently operating. As such, it has registrations from many of the earliest participants in the cannabis sector. We believe that this database of users, the brand equity in the name, and the thousands of images and posts already contained within the site can all add up to building a powerful presence in this nascent sector.
 
Difficulties in obtaining finances have delayed our plans to relaunch WeedTracker.com, but management believes that a new, mobile implementation of this site will be ready in early calendar 2017.  At present, CrowdGather is in discussions with several technology development agencies who seek to partner with us on revising WeedTracker.  As part of these discussions, we may ultimately sell majority interest in WeedTracker in order to accelerate its development and growth without having to increase our cost structure.
 
At present, our lack of financial resources has required management to put on hold its plans for a cannabis coworking space to open in early 2017.  Our focus instead will be on generating maximum leverage from all of our assets in a way that is cost effective and allows for us to put our exclusive focus on the cannabis opportunity.
 
Revenues. We derive revenue principally from the sale of Internet advertising and sponsorships, as well as from subscription services on free forum hosting platforms and e-commerce. The Internet is an attractive forum for certain advertisers, depending on the number of users we have and a variety of other factors.  Internet advertising spending continues to increase on an annual basis.  We believe that significant revenues can be generated from online advertising both for our Company-owned sites as well as on a commission sales basis for our third-party network sites.
 
Plaor generated revenue from Mega Fame Casino through the sale of virtual currency to players that they may exchange to play at any of our online slot machines, video poker machines, Hold’em style poker tables, or for other features and experiences available within Mega Fame Casino. Players can pay for our virtual currency using Facebook local currency payments when playing our games through Facebook and can use other payment methods such as credit cards or PayPal on other platforms. Mega Fame Casino currently had nearly 14,000 daily active users at the time of the sale of Plaor, Inc to Native Games America.
 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution. We intend to pursue direct sales with advertisers interested in exposing their products or services to our forum populations on a targeted basis.  We will work not only with direct advertisers, but also advertising networks as represented by intermediaries.  A key component of our strategy will be to customize advertising programs that are directly relevant to an advertiser, while not at odds with our online communities.  We will also allow for direct personalized advertising sales to the members of our respective forum communities who wish to market their products or services to their fellow members.
 
We hope to develop a widely recognized brand, which will enable us to attract, retain, and more deeply engage users, forum owners, advertisers, publishers, and developers. We believe a great brand begins with a great product, services, and content.  We focus on each step of product and services development, deployment, and management and content design to understand our offerings and how best to market them to our communities of potential and existing users. We hope to use online advertising, and leverage our online network and our distribution partnerships to market our products and services to the right people at the right time. With continued investment in brand and product marketing, we believe we can continue to attract and engage users, advertisers, publishers, and developers.

Competition. We operate in the Internet products, services, and content markets, which are highly competitive and characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and increasing competition from companies offering communication, information, and entertainment services integrated into other products and media properties.
 
We compete for users, advertisers, publishers, and developers with many other providers of online services, including Web businesses where expertise in a particular market segment may provide a competitive advantage and with social media and networking competitors. Ad networks which create specialized marketing solutions for specific advertiser or publishers segments, also compete with us for a share of marketing budgets.
 
We compete with companies to attract users and developers as well as attract advertisers and publishers to our forums. The principal competitive factors relating to attracting and retaining users include the usefulness, accessibility, integration, and personalization of the forums that we offer and the overall user experience on our sites.
 
Currently, there are a number of other companies that provide similar offerings to ours in both the digital and cannabis coworking domains. Companies like WeedMaps.com and MassRoots have much larger user bases than our WeedTracker, but we believe the sector is still in its early emerging stages and that plenty of opportunities abound for us as well as future entrants to this market.
 
Over time, our competitors may be local or international enterprises and may have financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources greater than ours. These companies may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and consultants.
 
Our competitive position will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified advisors with industry depth, and talented managerial, operational and other personnel. Our competitive position will also depend on our ability to develop and acquire effective digital assets in parallel with securing profitable locations for our coworking spaces.
 
Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, more industry experience, larger customer or user bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. We may not be able to compete with either the large or mid-sized companies. We are also at a significant competitive disadvantage within the Internet industry because we have limited capital resources. Our ability to compete will depend on our ability to obtain users of our products without spending any significant funds to market and promote our products.
 
Intellectual Property. Our intellectual property assets include domain names and websites; trademarks related to our brands, products and services; copyrights in software and creative content; trade secrets; and other intellectual property rights and licenses of various kinds. We also currently own the web domain www.crowdgather.com , which serves as our corporate website.  Our portfolio currently consists of over 350 domain names and over 70 web properties at various stages of development.  
 
Under current domain name registration practices, no one else can obtain an identical domain name, but someone might obtain a similar name, or the identical name with a different suffix, such as “.org”, or with a country designation.  The regulation of domain names in the United States and in foreign countries is subject to change, and we could be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that infringe or otherwise decrease the value of our domain names.
 
We seek to protect our intellectual property assets through patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other laws of the United States and other countries, and through contractual provisions. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and non-disclosure agreements with third parties with whom we conduct business in order to secure our proprietary rights and additionally limit access to, and disclosure of, our proprietary information. We consider our trademarks to be our most valuable assets and we will seek to register these trademarks in the United States and will seek to protect them. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademark, patent, copyright, and trade secret rights to third parties.

Government Regulation. We are subject to regulations and laws directly applicable to providers of online content and services. Many laws and regulations, however, are pending and may be adopted in the United States, individual states and local jurisdictions and other countries with respect to the Internet. The federal government and some state governments have introduced or considered legislation relating to Internet usage generally, including measures relating to privacy and data security, as well as specific legislation aimed at social networking sites, such as ours.  It is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be adopted, and certain proposals, if adopted, could negatively affect our business. We do not know for certain how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, copyright and other intellectual property issues, digital rights management, security, illegal or obscene content, retransmission of media, spyware, and personal privacy and data protection apply to the Internet.  We monitor pending legislation to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments within the industry.
 
A number of U.S. federal laws, including those referenced below, impact our business. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) is intended, in part, to limit the liability of eligible online service providers for listing or linking to third-party Websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights of others. Portions of the Communications Decency Act (“CDA”) are intended to provide statutory protections to online service providers who distribute third-party content. We rely on the protections provided by both the DMCA and CDA in conducting our business. Any changes in these laws or judicial interpretations narrowing their protections will subject us to greater risk of liability and may increase our costs of compliance with these regulations or limit our ability to operate certain lines of business. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”) prohibits web sites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent. The Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (“CAN-SPAM”) regulates the distribution of unsolicited commercial emails, or “spam.” Online services provided by us may be subject to COPPA and CAN-SPAM requirements. Congress and individual states may also consider online privacy legislation that would apply to personal information collected from teens and adults. We believe that we are in material compliance with the requirements imposed by those laws and regulations.
 
We are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations applied to businesses generally. We believe that we are in conformity with all applicable laws in all relevant jurisdictions. We do not believe that we have not been affected by any of the rules and regulations specified in this section.
 
Cannabis is currently a Schedule I controlled substance and is, therefore, illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized, its use, possession, or cultivation remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse.
 
Research and Development. We seek to continually enhance, expand, and launch products and features to meet evolving user, advertiser, and publisher needs for technological innovation and a deeper, more integrated experience for the online community of users. We intend to leverage our internal development efforts through technology acquisitions.  
Our Subsidiaries. Our sole remaining subsidiary is Adisn, Inc. Our former subsidiary Plaor, Inc. was sold on March 18, 2016.
 
Employees. As of December 16, 2016, we have 3 full time employees.  None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, nor are they represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider relations with our employees to be good.
