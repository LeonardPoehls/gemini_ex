Item 1. Business.
 All Marketing Solutions, Inc. (All Marketing Solutions, we, the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on December 17, 2008 and established a fiscal year end of December 31. We are a Company formed in order to enter into the international market for patent consulting and technology transfer services.
 The Company business model is to assist small business and entrepreneurs that have developed patentable novel products or services but does not have the financial resources to fund their own patent application. The Company will take an equity position in the product and pay for the patent application on behalf of the inventor. The patents will be applied listing both the inventor and the Company as co-patent holders. The estimated cost of a US patent application is between $20,000 and $30,000 US. The Company does not intend to market any of the products it accepts for patent application, once a patent pending has been issued it is the companys intent to sell the patent application to an individual or Company who already operates within the same industry. The Company will negotiate with each inventor on the Companys equity share but the Companys standard offer will be 50% ownership in the invention. If the Company is successful in taking an equity position, it will provide the funds for making the patent application, use its knowledge and expertise in arranging the filing of the patent application, and it will sell the patent. All of these efforts will be the Companys alone, with no participation or efforts of any other party. The Company will use the Internet to markets services as well and attend some tradeshows that are specific to inventors and entrepreneurs such as INPEX the largest such trade show in the United States.

In January of 2014 the Company expanded its business model to identify entrepreneurs or companies with emerging technologies that are potentially patentable and at a stage where funding and/or marketing and management expertise is required; first to protect these technologies and second to take advantage of the opportunity they afford the target market. The Company is interested in evaluating both product and service technologies, which technologies meet the Companys objectives. Upon successful completion of due diligence, the Companys intention is to acquire or partner with these entrepreneurs or companies.

Early in 2014, the Company announced OneBigDrive. Customers downloading OneBigDrive were provided with an easy-to-use one-stop solution for consolidating multiple free cloud storage accounts into one. OneBigDrive would consolidate 32 gigabytes of free cloud storage provided by Box, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive. 

On May 12, 2014, the Company announced that its OneBigDrive application is now integrated with Box.com, consolidating more free storage for OneBigDrive customers and enabling Box.com customers the ability to utilize OneBigDrives technology.

On February 15, 2015 the Company announced it was in the final stages of hubiC testing for cloud storage services. Once fully integrated, All Marketing Solutions announced that the minimum consolidation capability would raise by 25GB. In addition, the Company announced in February that it was changing its product name OneBigDrive to Cloudz.

Coudz is available to customers by downloading the software from the Companys web site. Cloudz will operate on Windows, Mac OSx, IOs and Android.
 
Since December 17, 2008 (inception) through December 31, 2017 the Company has no revenues and has accumulated losses since inception of $1,387,077.
