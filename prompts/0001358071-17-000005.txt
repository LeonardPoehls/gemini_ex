Item 1. Business
General
 
Concho Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Concho,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”) formed in February 2006, is an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, exploration and production of oil and natural gas properties. Our core operations are focused in the Permian Basin of southeast New Mexico and west Texas. The Permian Basin is one of the most prolific oil and natural gas producing regions in the United States and is characterized by an extensive production history, long reserve life, multiple producing horizons and enhanced recovery potential. Currently, the majority of the rigs running in the Permian Basin are drilling horizontal wells. Concho’s legacy in the Permian Basin provides us a deep understanding of operating and geological trends. We are actively applying new technologies, such as extended length lateral drilling and enhanced completion techniques, throughout our four core operating areas: the Northern Delaware Basin, the Southern Delaware Basin, the Midland Basin and the New Mexico Shelf. Our strategy remains focused on development and exploration activities on our multi-year project inventory and pursuing acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives.
Acquisitions
 
Reliance Acquisition

In October 2016, we completed an acquisition of approximately 40,000 net acres in the Northern Midland Basin and other assets from Reliance Energy, Inc. (collectively, the “Reliance Acquisition”) for approximately $1.7 billion. As consideration for the acquisition, we paid approximately $1.2 billion in cash and issued to the seller approximately 3.9 million shares of common stock with an approximate value of $0.5 billion.
Business and Properties
 
Our core operations are focused in the Permian Basin, which underlies an area of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas approximately 250 miles wide and 300 miles long. Commercial accumulations of hydrocarbons occur in multiple stratigraphic horizons, at depths ranging from less than 1,000 feet to over 25,000 feet. At December 31, 2016, substantially all of our 720.0 MMBoe total estimated proved reserves were located in our core operating areas and consisted of approximately 59.5 percent oil and 40.5 percent natural gas. We have assembled a multi-year inventory of horizontal development and exploration projects, including projects to further evaluate the regional extent and multi-pay potential of our Northern Delaware Basin, Southern Delaware Basin, Midland Basin and New Mexico Shelf assets.

 | Awaiting completion at year-end | | 43.8% | | 25.5% | | 29.9% 
 | | | 100.0% | | 100.0% | | 100.0%

 
In 2016, we drilled 99.6 percent of our wells horizontally. In 2017, we intend to spend substantially all of our capital plan for drilling and completion activities on horizontal opportunities.
 
We produced approximately 55.1 MMBoe, 52.3 MMBoe and 40.9 MMBoe of oil and natural gas during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During 2016, approximately 76 percent of our total production was attributable to horizontal wells. During 2016, our total estimated proved reserves increased by approximately 96.5 MMBoe, primarily due to (i) 124.8 MMBoe of extensions and discoveries, (ii) 59.1 MMBoe of acquisitions and (iii) 63.3 MMBoe of positive technical and performance revisions primarily related to decreased lease operating expenses, which were partially offset by (i) 57.4 MMBoe of negative revisions due to proved undeveloped reserves reclassified to unproved reserves because they are no longer expected to be developed within five years of their initial recording, (ii) negative price revisions of 29.9 MMBoe, (iii) current year production of 55.1 MMBoe and (iv) 8.3 MMBoe from various divestitures completed throughout the year.

Marketing Arrangements
 
General. We market our oil and natural gas in accordance with standard energy industry practices. The marketing effort is coordinated with our operations group as it relates to the planning and preparation of future drilling programs so that available markets can be assessed and secured. This planning also involves the coordination of access to the physical facilities necessary to connect new producing wells as efficiently as possible upon their completion.
 
Oil. We generally do not transport our oil, and we do not refine or process the oil we produce. A portion of our oil in Southeast New Mexico is connected directly to oil gathering pipelines. Most of our gathered oil from the New Mexico Shelf is utilized in a two-refinery complex in Southeast New Mexico. Most of the oil production from the New Mexico portion of our Northern Delaware Basin core area is now connected to the Alpha Crude Connector, LLC (“ACC”) pipeline system. Most of the oil production connected to the ACC pipeline system is purchased by three different purchasers and moved on several different pipeline outlets off ACC. We have assigned our shipping rights on ACC to these purchasers and they purchase our production at the receipt points into ACC. The remaining oil in our Northern Delaware Basin core area that is not on ACC is purchased by approximately ten different oil purchasers and trucked to pipeline stations in the area. 
 
Most of our oil in the Southern Delaware Basin is on one of three different oil gathering systems in the area. We have a partial ownership in one of those gathering systems. The oil is then transported to the Crane/Midland/Colorado City pipeline corridor and then onto Cushing or Gulf Coast markets. A significant portion of our Midland Basin production is on one of five different gathering systems. Most of this production is sweet crude and is transported by third parties to the Cushing or the Gulf Coast market. The balance of our oil in these areas that is not directly connected to pipeline is trucked to unloading stations on those same pipelines. We sell the majority of the oil we produce under contracts using market-based pricing. This price is then adjusted for differentials based upon delivery location and oil quality.
 
Natural Gas. We consider all natural gas gathering and delivery infrastructure in the areas of our production and evaluate market options to obtain the best price reasonably available under the circumstances. We sell the majority of our natural gas under individually negotiated natural gas purchase contracts using market-based pricing. The majority of our natural gas is subject to long-term agreements that generally extend five to ten years from the effective date of the subject contract.
 
The majority of the natural gas we sell is casinghead gas sold at the lease location under percentage of proceeds processing contracts; however, we are currently transitioning to a mixture of percentage of proceeds and fee based contracts. The purchaser gathers our casinghead natural gas in the field where it is produced and transports it via pipeline to a natural gas processing plant where natural gas liquid products are extracted and sold by the processor. The remaining natural gas product is residue gas, or dry gas, which is placed on residue pipeline systems available in the area. Under our percentage of proceeds contracts, we receive a percentage of the value for the extracted liquids and the residue gas.
 
Our Principal Customers
 
We sell our oil and natural gas production principally to marketers and other purchasers that have access to pipeline facilities. In areas where there is no practical access to pipelines, oil is transported to storage facilities by trucks and rail owned or otherwise arranged by the marketers or purchasers. Our marketing of oil and natural gas can be affected by factors beyond our control, the effects of which cannot be accurately predicted.
 
For 2016, revenues from oil and natural gas sales to Plains Marketing and Transportation, Inc. and Holly Frontier Refining and Marketing, LLC accounted for approximately 29 percent and 16 percent, respectively, of our total operating revenues. While the loss of either of these purchasers may result in a temporary interruption in sales of, or a lower price for, our production, we believe that the loss of either of these purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our operations, as there are alternative purchasers in our producing regions.
 
Competition
 
The oil and natural gas industry in the areas in which we operate is highly competitive. We encounter strong competition from numerous parties, ranging generally from small independent producers to major integrated companies. We primarily encounter significant competition in acquiring properties. At higher commodity prices, we also face competition in contracting for drilling, pressure pumping and workover equipment and securing trained personnel. Many of these competitors have financial, technical and personnel resources substantially larger than ours. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable properties, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources will permit.
  8
  

In addition to competition for drilling, pressure pumping and workover equipment, we are also affected by the availability of related equipment and materials. The oil and natural gas industry periodically experiences shortages of drilling and workover rigs, equipment, pipe, materials and personnel, which can delay drilling, workover and exploration activities and cause significant price increases. We are unable to predict the timing or duration of any such shortages.
 
Working Capital
 
Based on current market conditions, we have maintained a stable liquidity position. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility. At December 31, 2016, we had no debt outstanding under our credit facility and more than $2.6 billion of liquidity available, including $53.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.5 billion of unused commitments under our credit facility. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, our cash position will be increased by our disposition of ACC for approximately $802.8 million and reduced by our Northern Delaware Basin acquisition for approximately $107.0 million, resulting in a net increase of $695.8 million. Our primary needs for cash are development, exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas assets, payment of contractual obligations and working capital obligations. However, additional borrowings under our credit facility or the issuance of additional debt securities will require a greater portion of our cash flow from operations to be used for the payment of interest and principal on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. 
 
In February 2017, we announced our updated 2017 capital budget, excluding acquisitions, of approximately $1.8 billion with expected capital spending to range between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion. Approximately 90 percent of capital will be directed to drilling and completion activity. Our 2017 capital program is expected to continue focusing on extended length lateral drilling. Our 2017 capital budget, based on our current expectations of commodity prices and costs, is expected to be within our cash flows. Our budget could change depending on numerous factors, including commodity prices, leverage metrics and industry conditions. However, if we were to outspend our cash flows, we could use our cash on hand, credit facility and other financing sources. We believe that we have adequate availability under our credit facility to fund any cash flow deficits. Our liquidity position, along with internally generated cash flows from operations, is expected to provide continued financial flexibility as we actively manage the pace of exploration and development activities and acquisitions of leasehold acreage. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations––Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity” for additional information regarding our liquidity and ability to fund working capital.

Applicable Laws and Regulations
 
Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
 
Regulation of transportation and sale of oil.  Prices at which sales of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are made are not currently regulated, and sales of these products are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.
 
Our sales of oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. In general, interstate oil pipeline rates must be cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market-based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. Effective January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system that permits an oil pipeline, subject to limited challenges, to annually increase or decrease its transportation rates due to inflationary changes in costs using a FERC approved index, without making a cost of service filing. Every five years, the FERC reviews the appropriateness of the index in relation to industry costs. On December 17, 2015, the FERC established a new Producer Price Index for Finished Goods (the “PPI-FG”) of PPI-FG plus 1.23 percent for the five-year period beginning July 1, 2016. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors.
 
Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis at posted tariff rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors.
 
Effective November 4, 2009, pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) issued a rule prohibiting market manipulation in the petroleum industry. The FTC rule prohibits any person, directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of oil, gasoline or petroleum distillates at wholesale, from knowingly engaging in any act, practice or course of business, including the making of any untrue statement of material fact, that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, or intentionally failing to state a material fact that under the circumstances renders a statement made by such person misleading, provided that such omission distorts or is likely to distort market conditions for any such product. A violation of this rule may result in civil penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation, in addition to any applicable penalty under the Federal Trade Commission Act.
 
Regulation of transportation and sale of natural gas.  Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (the “Natural Gas Act”), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (the “Natural Gas Policy Act”) and regulations issued under those acts by the FERC. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future, and market participants are prohibited from engaging in market manipulation. Deregulation of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the Natural Gas Policy Act. In 1989, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, which removed all Natural Gas Act and Natural Gas Policy Act price and non-price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993.
 
The FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. Since 1985, the FERC has endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis. The FERC has stated that open access policies are necessary to improve the competitive structure of the interstate natural gas pipeline industry and to create a regulatory framework that will put natural gas sellers into more direct contractual relations with natural gas buyers by, among other things, unbundling the sale of natural gas from the sale of transportation and storage services. Beginning in 1992, the FERC issued Order No. 636 and a series of related orders to implement its open access policies. As a result of the Order No. 636 program, the marketing and pricing of natural gas have been significantly altered. The interstate pipelines’ traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas has been eliminated and replaced by a structure under which pipelines provide transportation and storage services on an open access basis to others who buy and sell natural gas. Although these orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers, they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry.

In 2000, the FERC issued Order No. 637 and subsequent orders, which imposed a number of additional reforms designed to enhance competition in natural gas markets. Among other things, Order No. 637 effected changes in FERC regulations relating to scheduling procedures, capacity segmentation, penalties, rights of first refusal and information reporting.
 
In August 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”). Among other matters, EPAct 2005 amends the Natural Gas Act to make it unlawful for “any entity,” including otherwise non-jurisdictional producers such as us, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by the FERC, in contravention of rules prescribed by the FERC. The FERC’s rules implementing this provision make it unlawful, in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. EPAct 2005 also gives the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act or Natural Gas Policy Act up to $1 million per day per violation. The new anti-manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales, gathering or production, but does apply to activities of otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” natural gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which now includes the annual reporting requirements under Order No. 704, as described below. EPAct 2005 therefore reflects a significant expansion of the FERC’s enforcement authority. We do not anticipate we will be affected any differently than other producers of natural gas.  
 
In December 2007, the FERC issued a rule (“Order No. 704”), as clarified in orders on rehearing, requiring that any market participant, including a producer such as us, that engages in wholesale sales or purchases of natural gas that equal or exceed 2.2 million MMBtus during a calendar year to annually report, starting May 1, 2009, such sales and purchases to the FERC. These rules are intended to increase the transparency of the wholesale natural gas markets and to assist the FERC in monitoring such markets and in detecting market manipulation. We do not anticipate that we will be affected by these rules any differently than other producers of natural gas.
 
We cannot accurately predict whether the FERC’s actions will achieve the goal of increasing competition in markets in which our natural gas is sold. Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before the FERC and the courts. The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently established by the FERC will continue. However, we do not believe that any action taken will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers.
 
Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Although its policy is still in flux, the FERC has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase our costs of getting natural gas to point of sale locations.
 
Intrastate natural gas transportation is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. During the 2007 legislative session, the Texas State Legislature passed H.B. 3273 (the “Competition Bill”) and H.B. 1920 (the “LUG Bill”). The Competition Bill gives the Railroad Commission of Texas (the “RRC”) the ability to use either a cost-of-service method or a market-based method for setting rates for natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation pipelines in formal rate proceedings. It also gives the RRC specific authority to enforce its statutory duty to prevent discrimination in natural gas gathering and transportation, to enforce the requirement that parties participate in an informal complaint process and to penalize purchasers, transporters, and gatherers for taking discriminatory actions against shippers and sellers. The Competition Bill also provides producers with the unilateral option to determine whether or not confidentiality provisions are included in a contract to which a producer is a party for the sale, transportation or gathering of natural gas. The LUG Bill modifies the informal complaint process at the RRC with procedures unique to lost and unaccounted for natural gas issues. It extends the types of information that can be requested, provides producers with an annual audit right, and provides the RRC with the authority to make determinations and issue orders in specific situations. Both the Competition Bill and the LUG Bill became effective on September 1, 2007, and the RRC rules implementing the RRC’s authority pursuant to the bills became effective on April 28, 2008.
 
Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material 
  11
  
difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
 
Regulation of production.  The production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. All of the states in which we own and operate properties have regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, the regulation of well spacing, and the plugging and abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction. The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.
 
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
 
General. Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection as well as the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws, rules and regulations may, among other things:
 
·         require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences;
 
·         restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production and saltwater disposal activities;
 
·         limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and
 
·         require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells.
 
The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, environmental laws and regulations are revised frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs.
 
The following is a summary of some of the existing laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject.
 
Waste handling. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Pursuant to regulatory guidance issued by the federal Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil or natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA’s non-hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in December 2016, the EPA and certain environmental organizations entered into a consent decree to address EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The consent decree requires EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. Any such change could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Also, in the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents and waste oils that may be regulated as hazardous wastes if such wastes have hazardous characteristics.
 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liability, without 
  12
  
regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
 
We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years. Although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons were not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination.
 
Water discharges. The federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, including dredge and fill activities in regulated wetlands, is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, or, in some circumstances, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”), or an analogous state agency. In September 2015, new EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers rules defining the scope of the EPA’s and the Corps’ jurisdiction became effective. To the extent the rule expands the scope of jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. The rule has been challenged in court on the grounds that it unlawfully expands the reach of Clean Water Act programs, and implementation of the rule has been stayed pending resolution of the court challenge. In addition, spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.
 
Safe Drinking Water Act. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production operations generate produced water, drilling muds, and other waste streams, some of which may be disposed via injection in underground wells situated in non-producing subsurface formations. The drilling and operation of these injection wells are regulated by the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (the “SDWA”). The Underground Injection Well Program under the SDWA requires that we obtain permits from the EPA or delegated state agencies for our disposal wells, establishes minimum standards for injection well operations, restricts the types and quantities of fluids that may be injected and prohibits the migration of fluid containing any contaminants into underground sources of drinking water. Any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells may cause degradation of freshwater, potentially resulting in cancellation of operations of a well, imposition of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of affected resources, and imposition of liability by landowners or other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and personal injuries. Any changes in the laws or regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new injection wells in the future may affect our ability to dispose of produced waters and would ultimately increase the cost of our operations, which costs could be significant. For example, the RRC recently adopted new permit rules for injection wells to address seismic activity concerns within the state. Among other things, the rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells, and allow the RRC to modify, suspend, or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity. Furthermore, in response to recent seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of oil and gas-related wastewaters, federal and some state agencies have begun investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have shut down or imposed moratoria on the use of such injection wells. For example, in 2016, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission issued various orders and regulations applicable to disposal operations in specific counties in Oklahoma. These rules require that disposal well operators, among other things, conduct additional mechanical integrity testing, make sure that their wells are not injecting wastes into targeted formations, and/or reduce the volumes of wastes disposed in such wells. If new regulatory initiatives are implemented that restrict or prohibit the use of underground injection wells in areas where we rely upon the use of such wells in our operations, our costs to operate 
  13
  
may significantly increase, and our ability to continue production may be delayed or limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
 
Air emissions. The federal Clean Air Act (the “CAA”), and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources.
 
For example, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. In addition, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules under the CAA regarding criteria for aggregating multiple sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities (such as tank batteries), on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements, which in turn could result in operational delays or require us to install costly pollution control equipment. In a separate rulemaking in June 2016, the EPA finalized new air emission control requirements for emissions of methane from certain equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. The final rule package includes first-time standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions, and also imposes leak detection and repair requirements on operators. In addition, the rule package extends existing volatile organic compound (“VOC”) standards under the EPA’s Subpart OOOO of the New Source Performance Standards to include previously unregulated equipment within the oil and natural gas source category. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) finalized similar rules in November 2016 that limit methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas operations on federal lands through limitations on the venting and flaring of gas, as well as enhanced leak detection and repair requirements. The BLM adopted final rules in January 2017; however, operators generally have one year from the January 2017 effective date of the rule to come into compliance with the rule’s requirements. These air emission rules have the potential to increase our compliance costs. Compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of natural gas and oil projects and increase our costs of development and production, which costs could be significant. However, we do not believe that compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 
Climate change.   In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other “greenhouse gases” (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has issued regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. These regulations include limits on tailpipe emissions from motor vehicles and preconstruction and operating permit requirements for certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States, as well as certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis, including GHG emissions resulting from the completion and workover operations of hydraulically fractured oil wells. Recent federal regulatory action with respect to climate change has focused on methane emissions. As noted above, both the EPA and the BLM finalized rules in 2016 that limit methane emissions from upstream oil and gas exploration and production operations. Increased regulation of methane and other GHGs have the potential to result in increased compliance costs and, consequently, adversely affect our operations.
 
While Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs in recent years. In the absence of Congressional action, many states have established GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and natural gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall GHG emission reduction goal.
 
The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances, or to comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Reduced demand for the oil and gas that we produce could also have the effect of lowering the value of our reserves. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and 
  14
  
severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Hydraulic fracturing.  Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of oil and/or natural gas from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We routinely use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance in February 2014 governing such activities. The EPA has also issued final regulations under the CAA establishing performance standards, including standards for the capture of VOCs and methane released during hydraulic fracturing; an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing; and final rules in June 2016 that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. In addition, the BLM finalized rules in March 2015 that impose new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands. The U.S. District Court of Wyoming has temporarily stayed implementation of this rule. A final decision has not yet been issued.
 
At the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure, and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, New Mexico and Texas have adopted hydraulic fracturing fluid disclosure requirements, and the RRC has also adopted rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. In addition, local governments have also taken steps to regulate hydraulic fracturing, including imposing restrictions or moratoria on oil and gas activities occurring within their boundaries. If new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.
 
In addition, certain governmental reviews are either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. Since the report did not find a direct link between hydraulic fracturing itself and contamination of groundwater resources, this years-long study report does not appear to provide any basis for further regulation of hydraulic fracturing at the federal level.
 
We do not have insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations; however, we believe our well control, general liability and excess liability insurance policies may cover third-party claims related to hydraulic fracturing operations and associated legal expenses in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of such policies. If new laws or regulations significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing activities or impose burdens on new permitting or operating requirements, our ability to utilize hydraulic fracturing may be curtailed, and this may in turn reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves.
 
Operations on Federal Lands. We currently operate on federal lands under the jurisdiction of the BLM. Permitting for oil and gas activities on federal lands can take significantly longer than the state permitting process. Delays in obtaining permits necessary can disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business. As noted above, in November 2016, the BLM finalized rules that restrict methane emissions from oil and gas activities on federal lands by limiting venting and flaring of natural gas from wells and other equipment. The final rule also requires operators to pay royalties to the BLM on flared gas from wells already connected to gas capture infrastructure, and allows the agency to set royalty rates at or above 12.5 percent of the value of production. These rules could result in increased compliance costs for our operations, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 
Endangered species.   The federal Endangered Species Act (the “ESA”) and analogous state laws regulate activities that could have an adverse effect on threatened or endangered species. Some of our drilling operations are conducted in areas where protected species are known to exist. In these areas, we may be obligated to develop and implement plans to avoid potential adverse impacts to protected species, and we may be prohibited from conducting drilling operations in certain locations or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons, when our operations could have an adverse effect 
  15
  
on the species. It is also possible that a federal or state agency could order a complete halt to drilling activities in certain locations if it is determined that such activities may have a serious adverse effect on a protected species. The presence of a protected species in areas where we perform drilling activities could impair our ability to timely complete drilling and developmental operations and could adversely affect our future production from those areas. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to make a determination on listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA before the completion of the agency’s 2017 fiscal year. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we or our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate could cause us or our customers to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures and could result in delays or limitations in our customers’ performance of operations, which could reduce demand for our midstream services.
 
National Environmental Policy Act. Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an environmental assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that may be made available for public review and comment. All of our current exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay or even halt development of some of our oil and natural gas projects.
 
OSHA and other laws and regulations. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. Also, pursuant to OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established a variety of standards relating to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety.
 
We do not believe that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to our current operations will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For instance, we did not incur any material capital expenditures for remediation or pollution control activities during 2016. Additionally, as of the date of this report, we are not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital expenditures during 2017. However, we cannot assure you that the passage or application of more stringent laws or regulations in the future will not have a negative impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
 
Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDAX
 
EBITDAX (as defined below) is presented herein and reconciled from the GAAP measure of net income (loss) because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company’s ability to internally fund exploration and development activities.
 
We define EBITDAX as net income (loss), plus (1) exploration and abandonments expense, (2) depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, (3) accretion expense, (4) impairments of long-lived assets, (5) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, (6) (gain) loss on derivatives, (7) net cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives, (8) (gain) loss on disposition of assets, net, (9) interest expense, (10) loss on extinguishment of debt, (11) federal and state income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations and (12) similar items listed above that are presented in discontinued operations. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income (loss) or cash flows as determined by GAAP.
 
Our EBITDAX measure provides additional information which may be used to better understand our operations, and it is also a material component of one of the financial covenants under our credit facility. EBITDAX is one of several metrics that we use as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as an indicator of operating performance. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable and depletable assets. EBITDAX, as used by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We believe that EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used by our management team and by other users of our consolidated financial statements, including by lenders pursuant to a covenant in our credit facility. For example, EBITDAX can be used to assess our operating performance and return on capital in comparison to other independent exploration and production companies without regard to financial or capital structure, and to assess the financial performance of our assets and our company without regard to capital structure or historical cost basis. Further, under our credit facility, an event of default could arise if we were not able to satisfy and remain in compliance with our specified financial ratio, defined as the maintenance of a quarterly ratio of total debt to consolidated last twelve months EBITDAX of no greater than 4.25 to 1.0. Non-compliance with this ratio could trigger an event of default under our credit facility, which then could trigger an event of default under our indentures. At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants under all of our debt instruments.
 
The following table provides a reconciliation of the GAAP measure of net income (loss) to EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for the periods indicated:
 
 | | | Years Ended December 31,
