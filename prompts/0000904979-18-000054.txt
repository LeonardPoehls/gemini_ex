Item 1. | Business.

General 
Shiloh Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the "Company," "Shiloh," "us," "our" or "we") is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1993. We are a global innovative solutions provider focusing on lightweighting technologies that provide environmental and safety benefits to the mobility market. Shiloh, headquartered in Valley City, Ohio, has a global network of manufacturing operations and technical centers in Asia, Europe and North America.
Our multi-component, multi-material solutions are comprised of a variety of alloys in aluminum, magnesium and steel grades, along with our proprietary line of noise and vibration reducing ShilohCore® acoustic laminate products. The strategic BlankLight®, CastLight® and StampLight® brands combine to maximize lightweighting solutions without compromising safety or performance. Shiloh delivers these solutions in body structure, chassis and propulsion systems to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") and "Tier 1" suppliers in the automotive and commercial vehicle markets.
 Shiloh operates as one end-customer focused reporting segment.

Raw Materials 
The primary raw materials required for our operations are hot-rolled and cold-rolled coated steel, as well as, aluminum and magnesium ingots. We obtain steel from a number of primary steel producers and steel service centers. The majority of the steel is purchased through customers' steel buying programs. Under these programs, we purchase steel at the price that our customers negotiated with their steel suppliers. We take ownership of the steel in many instances; however, the customers are generally responsible for commodity price fluctuations. Through centralized purchasing, we attempt to purchase raw materials at the lowest competitive prices for the quantity purchased across a broad supplier base. The supply of steel available for processing is a function of the production levels of primary steel producers. A portion of our steel products and processing services are provided to customers on a toll processing basis. Under these arrangements, we charge a specified fee for operations performed without acquiring ownership of the steel and being burdened with the attendant costs of ownership or risk of loss. 
For our aluminum and magnesium, used in the CastLight® product brand, the cost of raw materials is adjusted frequently to align with secured purchase commitments based on customer releases or based on referenced metal index plus additional material cost spreads agreed to by us and our customers. Primary aluminum alloys are used in our proprietary "Thin Tech®" castings processes, which allow heat treat and enhanced mechanical properties. Secondary smelting is the process of recycling aluminum, which has a positive impact environmentally and economically. These types of alloys are used in our conventional die casting process. We purchase from suppliers in the U.S. and China based on competitiveness. 
Competition 
We compete in the laser welding, stamping, die casting and close-tolerance machining industries. Competitors within our main product brands vary. BlankLight® competitors include numerous metal blanking companies ranging in all sizes, including raw material manufacturers and customers. Welded blank competition in North America includes TWB Company LLC and ArcelorMittal USA. Most laser welded blank competitors are affiliated with raw material or distribution providers. Competition for sales of automotive stamping and assemblies is also intense. StampLight® competitors include Gestamp, L&W, Inc., Flex-n-Gate Corporation, Midway Products Group Inc., Narmco Group and Kirchhoff Automotive Group. CastLight® competitors include Bocar Group, Cosma International (a Magna Company), Georg Fischer, Gnotec AB, KSM Casting Group, Madison Kipp Corporation (MKC), Meridian (subsidiary of Wangfeng Auto Holdings Group), Nemak, Pace Industries, RCM Industries and Ryobi Aluminum Casting (USA), Inc., which are all competing for a growing number of automotive projects. In almost all instances, we compete through our main strategies of "Lightweighting Without Compromise®" and "Lightweighting With Benefits®", which provides us with the ability to provide solutions that do not compromise part integrity such as performance, safety, sound and efficiency. Development and design optimization to lightweight products allows customers to achieve vehicle weight, fuel economy and/or ride and handling targets while favorably impacting the environment.
Employees 
As of October 31, 2018, we had approximately 4,200 employees. Organized labor unions represent 17% of our U.S. hourly employees and 99% of our non-U.S. employees. 
Each of our unionized manufacturing facilities has its own labor agreement with its own expiration date. As a result, no contract expiration date affects more than one facility. 
Backlog 
A significant portion of our business pertains to automobile platforms for various model years. Orders against these platforms are subject to releases by the customer and are not considered firm orders until close to time of shipment. Backlog, therefore, is not a meaningful indicator of future performance. 
Seasonality 
Our business is moderately seasonal because many OEM customers close assembly plants primarily for periods in summer months and holiday seasons for model year changeovers. Shut-down periods vary by country. For additional information, refer to Note 19 "Quarterly Results of Operations" to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this report.

Environmental Matters 
We are subject to environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air, discharges to waterways and generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. 
We are also subject to laws and regulations that can require the remediation of contamination that exists at current or former facilities. In addition, we are subject to other federal and state laws and regulations regarding health and safety matters. The majority of our production facilities have permits and licenses allowing and regulating air emissions and water discharges. While the Company believes that at the present time its production facilities are in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations, these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is impossible to predict whether compliance with these laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on us in the future. 
ISO 14001 is a voluntary international standard issued in September 1996 and updated in 2015 by the International Organization for Standardization. ISO 14001 identifies the elements of an Environmental Management System ("EMS") necessary for an organization to effectively manage its effect on the environment. The ultimate objective of the standard is to integrate the EMS with overall business management processes and systems so that environmental considerations are a routine part of business decisions.  All of our manufacturing facilities are certified to the ISO 14001 standard. We have completed the certification process at each of our manufacturing facilities to the IATF 16949 standard, which has been the global benchmark for an international quality management system in the automotive industry.  
Research and Development
 We perform research, development, design and other engineering activities for the following primary reasons:

• | to provide solutions for customers


• | to integrate our leading technologies into advanced products and processes


• | to provide engineering support for all of our manufacturing sites


• | to provide technological expertise in engineering and design development

Along with our global manufacturing locations, we maintain Sales and Technical Centers in Asia (Shanghai, China), Europe (Gothenburg, Sweden) and North America (Plymouth, Michigan and Valley City, Ohio). Furthermore, we have Customer Service Centers in Germany (Munich and Stuttgart), Italy (Turin) and the United Kingdom (Evesham, England). Each of our Sales and Technical Centers is engaged in engineering, research and development efforts working closely with customers to develop custom solutions to meet their needs.
Intellectual Property
We hold 105 issued patents on a worldwide basis, including 34 issued U.S. patents and 57 patent applications in process worldwide. Of the 105 issued patents, 28% are in production use and/or are licensed to third parties and the remaining 72% are being considered for future production use or provide a strategic technological benefit to us. We do not materially rely on any single patent, nor will the expiration of any single patent materially affect our business. Our current patents expire over various periods into the year 2034. We are actively introducing and patenting new technology to replace formerly patented technology before the expiration of the existing patents. In the aggregate, our worldwide patent portfolio is materially important to our business because it enables us to achieve technological differentiation from our competitors. We also maintain 58 active trademark registrations and applications worldwide. In excess of 88% of these trademark registrations and applications are in commercial use by us or are licensed to third parties.
Segment and Geographic Information 
We conduct our business and report our information as one operating segment - Automotive and Commercial Vehicles. Our chief operating decision maker is the executive leadership team, which includes certain Vice Presidents, all Senior Vice Presidents and the Chief Executive Officer, as this team has the final authority over performance assessment and resource allocation decisions. In determining that one operating segment is appropriate, we considered the nature of the business activities and the existence of managers responsible for the operating activities. Customers and suppliers are substantially the same in the automotive and commercial vehicle industry.
Financial information regarding Company geographic mix is contained in Note 18 - "Business Segment Information" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.
