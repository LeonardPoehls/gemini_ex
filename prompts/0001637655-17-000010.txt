Item 1.    Business
Overview
Horizon Global Corporation, which we refer to herein as "Horizon," "Horizon Global," "we" or the "Company," became an independent, publicly traded company as the result of a spin-off, which we refer to herein as the “spin-off,” from TriMas Corporation, or “TriMas,” on June 30, 2015.
We are a leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of high-quality, custom-engineered towing, trailering, cargo management and other related accessory products on a global basis, serving the automotive aftermarket, retail and original equipment, or “OE,” channels. 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, as a result of the Westfalia Group acquisition, the Company realigned its executive management structure, which changed the information used by our chief operating decision maker to assess performance and allocate resources. As a result, we report the results of our business in three reportable segments: Horizon Americas, Horizon Asia‑Pacific, and Horizon Europe‑Africa. We have recast prior period amounts to conform to the way we currently manage and monitor segment performance under the new segments.
 Horizon Americas has historically operated primarily in North America, and we believe has been a leader in towing and trailering-related products sold through retail, aftermarket, OE and e-commerce channels. In recent years, Horizon Americas expanded its geographic footprint into the South American market. Horizon Asia‑Pacific and Horizon Europe‑Africa focus their sales and manufacturing efforts outside of North and South America, historically operating primarily in Australia and Europe, respectively, and we believe have been leaders in towing related products sold through the OE and aftermarket channels. We have expanded our geographic footprint into New Zealand, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and South Africa. We are in the early stages of our development in these additional markets, initially focusing primarily on supporting OE customers.
Our products are used in two primary categories across the world: commercial applications, or “Work,” and recreational activities, or “Play.” Some of the markets in our Work category include agricultural, automotive, construction, fleet, industrial, marine, military, mining and municipalities. Some of the markets in our Play category include equestrian, power sports, recreational vehicle, specialty automotive, truck accessory and other specialty towing applications. We believe that the primary brands we offer are among the most recognized in the markets we serve and are known for quality, safety and performance. Our products reach end consumers through many avenues, including independent retailers, warehouse distributors, dealers, OE, retail stores and online retailers.
We believe no individual competitor serving the channels we participate in can match our broad product portfolio, which we categorize into the following four groups:

▪ | Towing: This product category includes devices and accessories installed on a tow-vehicle for the purpose of attaching a trailer, camper, etc. such as hitches, fifth wheels, gooseneck hitches, weight distribution systems, wiring harnesses, draw bars, ball mounts, crossbars, towbars, security and other towing accessories; 


▪ | Trailering: This product category includes control devices and components of the trailer itself such as brake controls, jacks, winches, couplers, interior and exterior vehicle lighting and brake replacement parts; 


▪ | Cargo Management: This product category includes a wide variety of products used to facilitate the transportation of various forms of cargo, to secure that cargo or to organize items. Examples of these products are bike racks, roof cross bar systems, cargo carriers, luggage boxes, car interior protective products, rope, tie-downs, tarps, tarp straps, bungee cords, loading ramps and interior travel organizers; and 


▪ | Other: This product category includes a diverse range of items in our portfolio that do not fit into any of the previous three main categories. Items in this category include tubular push bars, side steps, sports bars, skid plates, oil pans and commercial brooms and brushes. 

We have positioned our product portfolio to create a variety of options based on price-point, ranging from entry-level to premium-level products across most of our markets. We believe the brands we offer in our aftermarket channel have significant customer recognition, with the four most significant being Reese®, Hayman-Reese™, Draw-Tite® and Westfalia®. We believe all four have substantial market share and have been leading brands in the towing market for over 50 years. These brands provide the foundation of our market position based on worldwide commercial and consumer acceptance. We also maintain a collection of 
 4

regionally recognized brands that include Aqua Clear™, Bulldog®, BTM, DHF, Engetran, Fulton®, Harper®, Kovil, Laitner™, Parkside®, Reese Secure™, Reese Explorer™, Reese Power Sports, Reese Towpower™, ROLA®, Tekonsha®, Trojan®, WesBarg® and Witter Towbar Systems. In addition to these product brands, we historically marketed our products to our OE customers in Australia, and more recently in North America, under the name TriMotive.
For information pertaining to net sales and operating profit attributed to our reportable segments, refer to Note 16, "Segment Information," included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Industry
Our products are sold into a diverse set of end-markets; the primary applications relate to automotive accessories for light and recreational vehicles. Purchases of automotive accessory parts are discretionary and we believe demand is driven by macro-economic factors including (i) employment trends, (ii) consumer sentiment and (iii) fuel prices, among others.
We believe all of these metrics impact both our Work- and Play-related sales. In addition, we believe the Play-related sales are more sensitive to changes in these indices, given the Play-related sales tend to be more directly related to disposable income levels. In general, recent decreases in unemployment and fuel prices, coupled with increases in consumer sentiment, are positive trends for our businesses.
Aftermarket and Retail Channels
We sell our products in the aftermarket and retail channels to a wide range of customers, including distributors, automotive retail stores, non-automotive retailers, installers and mass merchants. More recent trends in the aftermarket and retail channels include:

▪ | Channel Consolidation: In the more mature market of the United States, there has been increasing consolidation in distribution networks with larger, more sophisticated aftermarket distributors and retailers gaining market share. In kind, these distributors generally require larger, more sophisticated suppliers with product expertise, category management and supply chain services and capabilities, as well as a global manufacturing and services footprint. We provide customers in this category the opportunity to rationalize their supply base of vendors in our product lines by virtue of our broad offering and product expertise; and


▪ | Growth of Online Capabilities: Reaching consumers directly through online capabilities, including e-commerce, is having an increasing impact on the global automotive aftermarket and retail channels. Establishment of a robust online presence is critical for suppliers regardless of whether or not they participate directly in e-commerce. We believe we are positioned well to take advantage of this continuing trend, given our established online presence. We support consumers by offering a wide range of information on our products and services, including installation videos, custom-fit guides and links to authorized dealers, both brick and mortar and e-commerce. 

OE Channels
While OE demand is typically driven by planned vehicle production, suppliers also grow by increasing their product content per vehicle through sales of existing product lines or expansion into new product line offerings. Given the consolidation and globalization throughout the automotive industry, suppliers combining a global presence with strong engineering, technology, manufacturing, supply chain and customer support will be best positioned to take advantage of OE business opportunities. 
More recent trends in the global OE supplier market include:

▪ | Global Platform/Supplier Consolidation: OEs are adopting global vehicle platforms to decrease product development costs and increase manufacturing efficiency and profitability. As a result, OEs are selecting suppliers that have the capacity to manufacture and deliver products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt products to local variations.

 5

Suppliers with a global supply chain and efficient manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend. We believe we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of this trend as a result of our global manufacturing footprint, highly developed supply chain relationships and track record of success in solving application challenges in our product lines;

▪ | Outsourcing of Design and Manufacturing of Vehicle Parts and Systems: OEs continually strive to simplify their assembly processes, lower costs and reduce development times. As a result, they have increasingly relied on suppliers to perform many of the design, engineering, research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by OEs. Suppliers with extensive design and engineering capabilities are in the best position to benefit from this trend as they are able to offer OEs value-added solutions with superior features and convenience. We believe certain OEs have sought us out to assist with their engineering challenges to increase towing capacity and for the many solutions provided by our existing products; and


▪ | Shorter Product Development Cycles: Due to frequent shifts in government regulations and customer preferences, OEs are requiring suppliers to continue to provide new designs and product innovations. These trends are prevalent in mature markets as well as, emerging markets, which are advancing rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of the more mature markets. Suppliers with strong technologies, robust global engineering and development capabilities are best positioned to meet OE demands for rapid innovation. Our global engineering footprint and exposure to vehicles early in the development cycle enables a responsive solution to changing customer needs and facilitates the rapid deployment of the solution across the global launch of the customer’s platform.

Competitive Strengths
We believe our reportable segments share and benefit from the following competitive strengths:

▪ | Diverse Product Portfolio of Market Leading Brands. We believe we benefit from a diverse portfolio of high-quality and highly-engineered products sold under globally recognized and market leading brand names. By offering a wide range of products, we are able to provide a complete solution to satisfy our customers' towing, trailering and cargo management needs, as well as serve diverse channels through effective brand management. Our brands are well-known in their respective product areas and channels. We believe that we are the leading supplier of towing products and among the leading suppliers of trailering products globally.


▪ | Global Scale with Flexible Manufacturing Footprint and Supply Chain. We were built through internal growth and a series of acquisitions to become the only truly global automotive accessories company with the products we offer. We have the ability to produce low-volume, customized, quick-turn products in our global manufacturing facilities, while our sourcing arrangements with third-party suppliers provide us with the flexibility to manufacture or source high-volume products as end-market demand fluctuates. Our flexible manufacturing capability, low-cost manufacturing facilities and established supply chain allow us to more quickly and efficiently respond to changes in end-market demand.


▪ | Long-Term Relationships with a Diverse Customer Base. Our customers encompass a broad range of OEs, mass merchants, e-commerce websites, distributors, dealers, and independent installers, representing multiple channels to reaching the end consumer. Blue chip customers include Wal-Mart, Ford Motor Company, FCA, Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, AutoZone, Amazon, Toyota, Canadian Tire, LKQ, U-Haul, Home Depot and Etrailer, among others. Our customer relationships are well established, with many exceeding 20 years. These strong partnerships can provide stability to our revenue base through economic cycles. We believe Horizon’s diverse product portfolio, global scale and flexible manufacturing capabilities enable us to provide a unique value proposition to customers. 


▪ | Globally Competitive Cost Structure. Since becoming an independent public company, we have focused on margin improvement activities, identifying and acting on projects to reduce our cost structure. With focused, identifiable projects well under way or complete, we believe we will benefit from improved operating margins and cash flow that can then be deployed to high-value creation activities. The combination of our strong brand names, leading market position, flexible manufacturing and sourcing operations have historically resulted in significant cash flow generation.

▪ | Experienced Management Team. Our management team is led by our Chief Executive Officer, Mark Zeffiro, who was a senior executive at TriMas for over seven years and has more than 25 years of financial, operational and business leadership experience with companies such as Black & Decker and General Electric Company. David Rice, our Chief Financial Officer, joined TriMas in 2005 and brings more than 30 years of financial, audit and leadership experience to the role. David was previously division finance officer of Cequent Performance Products. John Aleva, President of Horizon Americas, has nearly 30 years of experience in automotive aftermarket, retail and OE, and has been with Horizon for over 11 years. The leadership team of Horizon Asia‑Pacific includes Jason Kieseker, who joined the Horizon business in 2001 and has held various leadership roles within our Horizon Asia‑Pacific business. The leadership team of Horizon Europe‑Africa includes Paul Caruso, who has over 30 years of experience in a variety of roles within the industrial and automotive markets. 

Key Business Priorities
Horizon Global established three strategic platforms for value creation focused on business improvement and transformation, supported by a company culture of continuous improvement.

▪ | Margin Expansion. Our first priority is to drive the organization to a 10% operating margin level within our strategic planning period. We believe the investments made in new and upgraded facilities and equipment over the past few years should provide the foundation, without significant additional investment, for additional margin expansion. We are developing an organization in which all team members are focused on constantly improving the efficiency of all operations through the adoption of lean and continuous improvement practices. 


▪ | Capital Structure. Our second priority is to improve our capital structure. Our net leverage ratio, as defined in certain of the agreements covering our indebtedness, at December 31, 2016 was approximately 3.6 times. The common stock offering and convertible notes offering executed in 2017 subsequently lowered our leverage ratio. Refer to Note 19, "Subsequent Events" in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Our long-term net leverage ratio target is less than 2 times. We aim to accomplish this goal through both margin improvement as well as paying down our fixed obligations, and should we decide to do so, we have a structure in place that allows us to prepay debt in addition to the amortization required under our term debt. 


▪ | Organic Growth. Our third priority is to grow the business 3% to 5% on an organic basis, annually. We have identified five broad areas of focused growth activities, involving geographic markets and sales channels, which we believe are particularly aligned with our competitive strengths. 

Growth Strategies
Prior to becoming an independent public company, Horizon operated on a regional basis under separate management teams, with independent business decisions and resource allocations made by the Horizon Americas, Horizon Asia‑Pacific and Horizon Europe‑Africa leaders. As a public company, we are reorganizing our global operations to operate as a single combined entity. As a result, we believe that we have multiple opportunities to integrate, improve and grow our business, whether via organic initiatives or via acquisitions of new products or in new geographies, through the following strategies:

▪ | Original Equipment. The global market for accessories and vehicle personalization is increasing and automotive manufacturers are looking for suppliers to partner with to create genuine accessories to meet this need. Historically, this has been a regional effort, but the growth of global OE has increased the need for global suppliers. Our geographic footprint, existing customer relationships and the increase in global vehicle platforms align to present us with unique opportunities to grow with our OE customers. 


▪ | E-commerce. We intend to leverage the breadth of our product portfolio and global manufacturing footprint to expand our presence in the high growth e-commerce channel. This strategy is applicable in our developed markets where a focus on content delivery and customer support drive growth. It is also a powerful tool as we look at developing new, less mature markets around the world, enabling a direct connection with the users of our product set. 


▪ | Latin American Markets. Since entering the Latin American market, we have witnessed a desire to accessorize vehicles among new entrants to the middle class. We expanded our global footprint and product portfolio in Brazil by acquiring DHF Soluções Automotivas Ltda and Engetran Engenharia, Indústria, e Comércio de Peças e Acessórios Veiculares Ltda, respectively, which are reported under Horizon Americas. We believe these expansions into new geographies provide opportunities for growth, while supporting both new and existing global customers.

▪ | Chinese Market. China is in the early stages of adoption for towing and trailering products. As this adoption rate increases, there is an opportunity for us to bring our experience in the safe use of these products into the market in a meaningful capacity. The rapidly growing middle class, in concert with a developing interest in an outdoor recreational lifestyle, is expected to result in incremental demand for our automotive aftermarket products and accessories. We intend to leverage our existing relationships with global OEs and our global manufacturing and distribution network to expand our sales in this developing economy. 


▪ | Product Innovation. Our focus in multi-generational product planning is to formalize the process by which we integrate the feedback and needs of users into our product development engine. We look to move beyond simply responding to the feedback that we receive, to anticipating the functionality future products need to possess to enrich the lives of our users. 

Marketing, Customers and Distribution
Horizon employs a dedicated sales force in each of our primary channels. In serving our customers globally, we rely upon our strong historical customer relationships, custom engineering capability, brand recognition, broad product offerings, our established distribution network and varied merchandising strategies to bolster our towing, trailering, cargo management and accessory product sales. Significant Horizon customers include Ford Motor Company, Toyota and General Motors/Holden in the OE channel; Wal-Mart, AutoZone and Super Retail Group in the retail channel; and LKQ, U-Haul and the Proex Group in the aftermarket channel. No customer represented greater than 10% of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014.
Competition
The competitive environment for automotive accessory products is highly fragmented and is characterized by numerous smaller suppliers, even the largest of which tend to focus in narrow product categories. We believe there is no individual competitor that has the breadth of product portfolio on a global basis in the markets we serve. Significant towing competitors include Curt Manufacturing, B&W Trailer Hitches, The Bosal Group, Brink, Buyers Products Company, Demco Products, PullRite, Westin Automotive Products and Camco. Significant trailering competitors include Pacific Rim, Dutton-Lainson, Shelby, Ultra-Fab, Sea-Sense and Atwood. In addition, competition in the cargo management product category primarily comes from Thule, Yakima, Bell, Masterlock and Saris.
Acquisition Strategy
We believe that our businesses have significant opportunities to grow through disciplined strategic acquisitions. We typically seek bolt-on acquisitions, in which we acquire another industry participant or adjacent product lines that enhance the strengths of our core businesses. When evaluating acquisition targets, we look for opportunities to expand our existing product offerings, gain access to new customers and end markets, add new early life cycle technologies, as well as add additional distribution channels, expand our geographic footprint and/or capitalize on scale and cost efficiencies.
Westfalia Acquisition
On October 4, 2016, we completed our previously announced acquisition of Westfalia-Automotive Holding GmbH and TeIJs Holding B.V., which we refer to collectively as the “Westfalia Group" or "Westfalia”. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of the Westfalia Group for cash consideration of approximately $99.2 million and the issuance to certain of the sellers of 2,704,310 shares of our common stock in a transaction exempt from registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, or the “Securities Act.” We funded the cash payment, as well as the repayment of certain of the Westfalia Group’s debt, through a combination of cash on hand and $152.0 million of incremental borrowings under our Term B Loan.
The Westfalia Group is a leading global towing company. Headquartered in Rheda-Wiedenbrück, Germany, with operating facilities in 11 countries, it manufactures towing and trailering products, including more than 1,700 different types of towbars, wiring kits and carrier systems for cars and light utility vehicles. It holds in excess of 300 issued patents and published patent applications protecting its unique line of towing and trailering products. The brands under which it markets its products include Westfalia, Terwa and Siarr.
The acquisition of the Westfalia Group positions us as a leading manufacturer of towing and trailering equipment in Europe and further complements our broad portfolio. We believe the acquisition will expand our opportunities for revenue and margin growth, increase our market share and augment our global OE footprint with access to new markets and customers.

Materials and Supply Arrangements
We are sensitive to price movements in our raw materials supply base. Our largest material purchases are for steel, copper, and aluminum. We also consume a significant amount of energy via utilities in our facilities. Historically, when we have experienced increasing costs of steel, we have successfully worked with our suppliers to manage cost pressures and disruptions in supply. Price increases used to offset inflation or a disruption of supply in core materials have generally been successful, although sometimes delayed. Increases in price for these purposes represent a risk in execution.
Employees and Labor Relations
As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 4,250 people, of which approximately 13% were located in the United States. In the United States, we have no collective bargaining agreements. Employee relations have generally been satisfactory.
On July 21, 2015, we announced the decision to close our manufacturing facility in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico along with our distribution warehouse in El Paso, Texas, within our Horizon Americas segment, impacting approximately 214 hourly and 47 salaried employees. During the second quarter of 2016, we vacated the El Paso, Texas and Juarez, Mexico sites. 
Seasonality and Backlog
We experience some seasonality in our business. Sales of towing and trailering products in the northern hemisphere, where we generate the majority of our sales, are generally stronger in the second and third calendar quarters, as trailer OEs, distributors and retailers acquire product for the spring and summer selling seasons. Our growing businesses in the southern hemisphere are stronger in the first and fourth calendar quarters. We do not consider order backlog to be a material factor in our businesses.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges and chemical and hazardous waste management and disposal. Some of these environmental laws hold owners or operators of land or businesses liable for their own and for previous owners' or operators' releases of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Other environmental laws and regulations require the obtainment and compliance with environmental permits. To date, costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material. However, the nature of our operations and our long history of industrial activities at certain of our current or former facilities, as well as those acquired, could potentially result in material environmental liabilities.
While we must comply with existing and pending climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties or accords, current laws and regulations have not had a material impact on our business, capital expenditures or financial position. Future events, including those relating to climate change or greenhouse gas regulation could require us to incur expenses related to the modification or curtailment of operations, installation of pollution control equipment or investigation and cleanup of contaminated sites.
Intangible Assets
Our identified intangible assets, consisting of customer relationships, trademarks and trade names and technology, are recorded at approximately $86.7 million as of December 31, 2016, net of accumulated amortization. The valuation of each of our identified intangibles was performed using broadly accepted valuation methodologies and techniques.
Customer Relationships. We have developed and maintained stable, long-term selling relationships with customer groups for specific branded products and/or focused market product offerings within each of our businesses. Useful lives assigned to customer relationship intangibles range from 5 to 25 years and have been estimated using historic customer retention and turnover data. Other factors considered in evaluating estimated useful lives include the diverse nature of focused markets and products of which we have significant share, how customers in these markets make purchases and these customers' position in the supply chain. We also monitor and evaluate the impact of other evolving risks including the threat of lower cost competitors and evolving technology.
 9

Trademarks and Trade Names. Each of our operating groups designs and manufactures products for focused markets under various trade names and trademarks. Our trademark/trade name intangibles are well-established and considered long-lived assets that require maintenance through advertising and promotion expenditures. Because it is our practice and intent to maintain and to continue to support, develop and market these trademarks/trade names for the foreseeable future, we consider our rights in these trademarks/trade names to have an indefinite life, except as otherwise dictated by applicable law. During the second quarter of 2016, we made a decision to simplify our brand offering in the Horizon Americas segment. This resulted in the impairment of trade names with an aggregate carrying value of $2.4 million. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we performed our annual assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Based on this assessment, we determined that certain trade names with an aggregate carrying value of $6.9 million were impaired. This resulted in impairment charges of $6.2 million. For additional information, refer to Note 6, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Technology. We hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents, patent applications, and proprietary product and process-oriented technologies. We have, and will continue to dedicate, technical resources toward the further development of our products and processes in order to maintain our competitive position in the industrial, commercial and consumer end markets that we serve. Estimated useful lives for our technology intangibles range from 3 to 15 years and are determined in part by any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit useful life. Other factors considered include the expected use of the technology by the operating groups, the expected useful life of the product and/or product programs to which the technology relates, and the rate of technology adoption by the industry.
International Operations
Approximately 34.0% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 were derived outside of the United States. We may significantly expand our international operations through organic growth and acquisitions. In addition, approximately 95.0% of our total net fixed assets as of December 31, 2016 were located outside of the United States. We operate manufacturing facilities in Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Romania, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. For information pertaining to the net sales and total assets attributed to our international operations, refer to Note 16, "Segment Information," included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
