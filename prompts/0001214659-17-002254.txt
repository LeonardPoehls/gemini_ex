Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Speedemissions, Inc. is one of the largest test-only emissions testing and safety inspection companies in the United States. We perform vehicle emissions testing and safety inspections in certain cities in which vehicle emissions testing is mandated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). As of March 24, 2017, we operated 21 vehicle emissions testing and safety inspection stations under the trade names of Speedemissions and Auto Emissions Express (in Atlanta, Georgia and St. Louis, Missouri). On March 10, 2017, we closed our Salt Lake City, Utah, station under a lease termination agreement with the landlord.  As compensation for the early termination of the station’s lease, the Company received a cash payment of $250,000 on March 20, 2017.  We also operate three mobile testing units in the Atlanta, Georgia area which service automotive dealerships and local government agencies. We manage our operations based on these two regions, and we have one reportable segment. References in this document to “Speedemissions,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean Speedemissions, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries.
 
We use computerized emissions testing and safety inspections equipment that test vehicles for compliance with vehicle emissions and safety standards. We purchase or lease these computerized testing systems from state approved equipment vendors. Our revenues are mainly generated from the testing or inspection fees charged to the registered owner of the vehicle. As a service to our customers, we also sell automotive parts and supplies such as windshield wipers, taillight bulbs and gas caps at select locations. However, we do not provide automotive repair services.
 
On June 22, 2010, the Company announced the launch of its first iPhone application, Carbonga. Carbonga diagnoses an automobile’s computer system using the on board diagnostic port available on vehicles produced since 1996. Carbonga can check over 2,000 vehicle fault codes. We launched version two of Carbonga on February 16, 2011. Version two improved the speed and performance of the application and added additional features, including the ability to receive vehicle safety recalls and Technical Service Bulletins, for an annual subscription fee.
 
During the quarter ended September 30, 2012, we formed a new company, SpeedEmissions Car Care, LLC, through which we franchised our vehicle emissions and safety inspections store model. Franchises are available to qualified store operators who have an interest in either a single- or multi-location opportunity in select cities where vehicle emissions testing/safety inspections and other automotive services are required. We signed an agreement with an Atlanta based franchise consulting company to assist with our plan to franchise our business model into a number of new U.S. markets. After securing approval for all the necessary disclosure documents, we began marketing franchises in the fourth quarter of 2012.  However, as of December 31, 2016, we have sold no franchises.
 
On November 30, 2012, we completed the acquisition of certain operating assets comprising five emission testing centers owned by Auto Emissions Express, LLC (“AEE”), a Georgia corporation.  Total purchase price for the five emission testing centers was $425,000 and included goodwill valued at $379,714.

On October 25, 2013, we completed the acquisition of certain operating assets comprising the remaining seven emission testing centers owned by AEE. AEE originally owned and operated twelve emission testing centers in the Atlanta, Georgia area, consisting of the seven emission testing centers that we purchased in October 2013 and the five emission testing centers that we purchased in November 2012 as discussed above. Total purchase price for the seven emission testing centers was $350,000 and included goodwill valued at $296,604.
 
During the three months ended June 30, 2014, we sold the assets comprising six of our Houston, Texas stores for a combined amount of $220,000, consisting of $152,500 in cash and notes receivable for $67,500.  This note was paid in full during the year ended December 31, 2015.
 
On December 5, 2014, we sold the assets comprising five of our six Salt Lake City, Utah stores for $1,350,000 in cash.  After accounting for the sale of these five emissions testing centers, as of December 31, 2016 we operated 22 emission testing centers in Atlanta, Georgia, St. Louis, Missouri and Salt Lake City, Utah metropolitan areas, plus three mobile testing units in the Atlanta, Georgia area.
 
On March 10, 2017, we closed our Salt Lake City, Utah, station under a lease termination agreement with the landlord.  As compensation for the early termination of the center’s lease, the Company received a cash payment of $250,000 on March 20, 2017. After accounting for the closing of this emissions testing center, we currently operate 21 emission testing centers in Atlanta, Georgia and St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan areas, plus three mobile testing units in the Atlanta, Georgia area.
 
Recent Developments
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue as a going concern.
 
Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $220,729 or $(0.00) per share, compared to a net loss $488,994 or $(0.00) per share for the year ended December 31, 2015. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $173,434, or 5.3%, to $3,439,456 from $3,266,022 in the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in same store revenue of $175,695, or 5.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
We have experienced recurring net losses which have caused an accumulated deficit of $22,027,626 at December 31, 2016, compared to an accumulated deficit of $21,806,897 at December 31, 2015. We had a working capital deficit of $1,599,535 at December 31, 2016 compared to a working capital deficit of $1,429,910 at December 31, 2015.
 
Our revenues over the past several years have been insufficient to attain profitable operations and to provide adequate levels of cash flow from operations. Our near-term liquidity and ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient revenues from our store operations to provide sufficient cash flow from operations to pay our current level of operating expenses, to provide for inventory purchases and to reduce past due amounts owed to vendors and service providers. No assurances can be given that we will be able to achieve sufficient levels of revenues in the near-term to provide adequate levels of cash flow from operations. As a result of our history of losses and financial condition, there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.
 
During the past several years, we have made reductions in employee headcount, sold or closed unprofitable stores, and reduced store operating expenses, corporate overhead and other operating expenses. At December 31, 2016, our primary source of liquidity for cash flows was cash received from our store operations. We are dependent on our revenues in the very near term to provide sufficient cash flow from operations to pay our current level of operating expenses, to provide for inventory purchases and to reduce past due amounts owed to landlords, vendors and service providers. No assurances may be given that the cash received from our store operations will be sufficient to cover our ongoing operating expenses. If the cash received from our store operations is not sufficient, we would need to obtain new financing or raise additional capital to continue as a going concern and to execute our business plan. There is no assurance that such financing or capital would be available or, if available, that we would be able to complete financing or a capital raise on satisfactory terms to allow us to continue as a going concern.
 
During the past several years, due to insufficient cash flow from operations, we have been extending payments owed to landlords and vendors beyond normal payment terms and deadlines.  Until such vendors are paid within normal payment terms, no assurances can be given that required services and materials needed to support our operations will continue to be provided. In addition, no assurances can be given that vendors will not pursue legal means to collect past due balances owed. Any interruption of services or materials would likely have an adverse impact on our operations and could impact our ability to continue as a going concern.

On December 13, 2013 and on January 10, 2014, the Circuit Court in the Twelfth Judicial Circuit in and for Sarasota County, Florida (the “Court”), entered an Order Granting Approval of Settlement Agreement (the “Order”) approving, among other things, the fairness of the terms and conditions of an exchange pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), in accordance with a Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) between the Company and IBC Funds, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“IBC”), in the matter entitled IBC Funds, LLC, vs. SpeedEmissions, Inc., Case Nos. 2013 CA 008762 NC and 2014 CA 000153 (the “Actions”). IBC commenced the Actions against us to recover an aggregate of $205,643 of past-due accounts payable, which IBC had purchased from certain of our vendors pursuant to the terms of separate claim purchase agreements between IBC and each of the respective vendors (the “Assigned Accounts), plus fees and costs (the “Claim”). The Assigned Accounts relate to certain research, technical, development and legal services. The Order provides for the full and final settlement of the Claim and the Action. The Settlement Agreement became effective and binding on December 13, 2013 and January 10, 2014, respectively.
 
The Settlement Agreement provides that in no event shall the number of shares of common stock issued by the Company to IBC or its designee in connection with the Settlement Agreement, when aggregated with all other shares of common stock then beneficially owned by IBC and its affiliates (as calculated pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and the rules and regulations thereunder), result in the beneficial ownership by IBC and its affiliates (as calculated pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) at any time of more than 9.99% of the common stock of the Company.  Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Company issued 59,098,059 of its common shares to IBC during the year ended December 31, 2014, in full satisfaction of all amounts due IBC under the Settlement Agreement.
 
Furthermore, the Settlement Agreement provides that, for so long as IBC or any of its affiliates hold any shares of common stock of the Company, the Company and its affiliates are prohibited from, among other things, voting any securities of the Company in favor of: (1) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (2) a sale or transfer of a material amount of the Company’s assets or its subsidiaries’ assets, (3) any material change in the Company’s present capitalization or dividend policy, (4) any other material change in the Company’s business or corporate structure, (5) a change in the Company’s charter, bylaws, or instruments corresponding thereto (6) causing a class of the Company’s securities to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association, (7) causing a class of the Company’s equity securities to become eligible for termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Exchange Act, (8) terminating the Company’s transfer agent, (9) taking any action which would impede the purposes and objects of the Settlement Agreement or (10) taking any action, intention, plan or arrangement similar to any of those enumerated above. These prohibitions may not be modified or waived without further order of the Court.  As of December 31, 2016, neither IBC nor any of its affiliates held any shares of common stock of the Company.
 
On November 5, 2014, the Company entered into a promissory note agreement with Dianna Parlontieri, wife of the Company’s President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, pursuant to which Mrs. Parlontieri loaned the Company $20,000 for working capital purposes. Under the terms of the promissory note, the Company agreed to repay the loan, plus interest, for a total amount of $20,400 by December 15, 2014.  Because the Company did not repay the loan in full by December 15, 2014, the Company is required to repay $1,700 on the 15th of each month, which began on December 15, 2014, until the loan is re-paid in full.  If any of the monthly payments are not paid on the respective due date then the monthly payment amount is subject to a default interest rate of 10% per annum.  The Company is currently in default of the terms of this promissory note as it did not make the required repayment on December 15, 2014 and has not made any of the required monthly payments as of the date of this report.
 
On March 6, 2015, the Company entered into another revenue-based factoring agreement with SP, pursuant to which the Company agreed to repay SP $60,000 from a loan made by SP to the Company, plus a fixed fee which the Company recorded as interest expense, for a total repayment amount of $76,800 by June 16, 2015.  The Company repaid the remaining balance on June 16, 2015 and, as a result, there was no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2015.
 
On April 16, 2015, the Company entered into a revolving loan agreement with Celtic Bank (“CB”), pursuant to which the Company initially borrowed $17,000 from CB.  Under the terms of the revolving loan agreement, the Company agreed to repay the initial loan, plus interest, for a total amount of $18,955 by October 15, 2015.  The Company made the required six monthly payments by the October 15, 2015 due date.  At their sole discretion, CB can increase the maximum availability under the revolving loan agreement above the $17,000 amount established upon the execution of the revolving loan agreement and, effective April 18, 2016, CB increased our borrowing limit to $33,200.  At March 24, 2017, the outstanding balance on our revolving loan facility with CB was approximately $27,000 and our cash balances were approximately $148,000.
 
On June 8, 2015, the Company entered into a revenue-based factoring agreement with Samson Partners, LLC (“SP”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to repay SP $250,000 from a loan made by SP to the Company, plus a fixed fee which the Company will record as interest expense, for a total repayment amount of $337,500 by April 14, 2016.  A portion of the proceeds were used to pay off the March 6, 2015 SP revenue-based factoring agreement. The Company repaid the remaining balance on January 8, 2016 and, as a result, there was no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2016.

On October 12, 2015, the Company entered into another revenue-based factoring agreement with SP, pursuant to which the Company agreed to repay SP $75,000 from a loan made by SP to the Company, plus a fixed fee which the Company recorded as interest expense, for a total repayment amount of $101,250 by August 22, 2016.  A portion of the proceeds were used to pay off the April 16, 2015 SP revenue-based factoring agreement described above. The Company repaid the remaining balance on May 31, 2016 and, as a result, there was no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2016.
 
On January 5, 2016, the Company entered into another revenue-based factoring agreement with SP, pursuant to which the Company agreed to repay SP $235,000 from a loan made by SP to the Company, plus a fixed fee which the Company recorded as interest expense, for a total repayment amount of $321,950 by January 10, 2017.  A portion of the proceeds were used to pay off the June 8, 2015 SP revenue-based factoring agreement described above.  The Company repaid the balance of the loan on September 23, 2016 and, as a result, there was no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2016.
 
On May 26, 2016, the Company entered into another revenue-based factoring agreement with SP, pursuant to which the Company agreed to repay SP $200,000 from a loan made by SP to the Company, plus a fixed fee which the Company will record as interest expense, for a total repayment amount of $260,000 by May 31, 2017.  A portion of the proceeds were used to pay off the October 12, 2015 SP revenue-based factoring agreement described above. The Company repaid the balance of the loan on December 27, 2016 and, as a result, there was no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2016.
 
On September 16, 2016, the Company entered into another revenue-based factoring agreement with SP, pursuant to which the Company agreed to repay SP $200,000 from a loan made by SP to the Company, plus a fixed fee which the Company will record as interest expense, for a total repayment amount of $270,000 by September 10, 2017.  A portion of the proceeds were used to pay off the January 5, 2016 SP revenue-based factoring agreement described above. Under the terms of the agreement, SP is authorized to make debits of $1,097 on each available banking day during the term of the agreement which represents a fee rate of 35.0%. The agreement had a balance due of $147,182 as of December 31, 2016.
 
On December 19, 2016, the Company entered into another revenue-based factoring agreement with SP, pursuant to which the Company agreed to repay SP $225,000 from a loan made by SP to the Company, plus a fixed fee which the Company will record as interest expense, for a total repayment amount of $290,250 by December 12, 2017.  A portion of the proceeds were used to pay off the May 26, 2016 SP revenue-based factoring agreement described above. Under the terms of the agreement, SP is authorized to make debits of $1,180 on each available banking day during the term of the agreement which represents a fee rate of 29.0%. The agreement had a balance due of $222,255 as of December 31, 2016.
 
We have been unable to make all required payments to the federal government for payroll taxes withheld from employee paychecks and the associated matching employer payroll taxes from April 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 and for November and December of 2016. As of March 24, 2017, we owed approximately $332,000, including penalties and interest assessed through December 31, 2016, for the previously described payroll tax obligations to the federal government.  We proposed a payment plan to the federal government and made payments totaling approximately $53,000 from September 30, 2015 through December 31, 2016, but we have not reached an agreed payment schedule for the remainder of our federal payroll tax obligations as of the date of this report. However, we made all federal tax deposits for 2017 payroll periods through March 24, 2017.
 
On March 10, 2017 we closed our Salt Lake City, Utah, station under a lease termination agreement with the landlord.  As compensation for the early termination of the station’s lease, the Company received a cash payment of $250,000 on March 20, 2017.
 
On March 20, 2017, we purchased certain assets of Auto Recycling of Montgomery, Inc. (“ARM”) which are located in Montgomery, Alabama.  The assets included land, buildings, equipment and inventory previously used in an auto recycling operation which ceased operations in June of 2014.  The purchase price was $175,000 for the land and buildings and $90,000 for the equipment and inventory.  As payment for the assets the Company entered into two separate note agreements. Terms of each note included an interest rate of ten percent and an amortization term of ten years with a seven year balloon payment.  Monthly payments for the $175,000 land and buildings note and for the $90,000 equipment and inventory note are $2,313and $1,189, respectively.  The Company intends to create an auto salvage business operation, but expects it will take approximately 60 days to hire employees and put the necessary business systems in place before sales operations can commence.
 
Our Typical Testing Center
 
Our testing centers generally are located in freestanding buildings in areas with high vehicle traffic counts, good visibility and easy access to major roadways. The typical testing center is located inside of a structure similar to a typical lube or tire change garage with doors at both ends so that vehicles can “drive-through” the facility. We also have structures that resemble a bank drive-through facility. We believe that we are creating brand awareness in our current testing stations by using a recognizable building style and façade, consistent color schemes, signs and employee uniforms, and by advertising in select local markets. Computerized testing systems are located in each building to test vehicle emissions and vehicle safety if applicable in that state.

Most of our emissions testing stations are open for business during weekdays between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., and from 8:30 a.m.to 5:00 p.m. on Saturdays. The average emissions test in Georgia takes approximately eight to 12 minutes to complete. In Missouri and Utah, because of the safety inspection, the completion time is slightly longer.
 
There are two types of primary emissions tests that are performed, the Accelerated Simulated Model (“ASM”) and the On-Board Diagnostic (“OBD”). The ASM test is performed on vehicles produced before 1996, while the OBD test is conducted on vehicles produced during and after 1996. In selected markets, a vehicle safety inspection is required to be performed. These tests apply to vehicles generally manufactured from 1983 through 2005, depending on the state. We generally operate one or two testing lanes at each testing center depending upon the size of the building. We typically lease the building from the property owners, although in the past, we constructed several buildings on land leases—a practice we no longer follow.
 
In our Atlanta, Georgia locations, under the guidelines of the Georgia Clean Air Force (“GCAF”) program, the mobile vehicle emissions testing units are only permitted to conduct the OBD test on 1996 and newer vehicles. In the Atlanta, Georgia area, we currently have three mobile units and they serve the automobile fleets of the federal, state, and local governments. All used cars in Georgia, prior to being re-sold, must have a vehicle emissions test, and we serve selected new and used car dealers throughout the greater Atlanta market with these mobile units.
 
Industry Background – Government and Regulatory Overview
 
The EPA reported in 2012 that approximately 148.0 million people lived in counties across the United States whose air pollution exceeded national air quality standards. According to the EPA, motor vehicles are responsible for nearly one half of the smog-forming volatile organic compounds, more than half of the nitrogen oxide emissions and about half of the toxic air pollutant emissions in the United States. Motor vehicles, including off road vehicles, now account for 75% of carbon monoxide emissions nationwide according to the EPA. In the United States, there are more than 250 million cars and light-duty trucks on the road according to the U.S. Federal Highway Administration.
 
The 2012 Motor Vehicle I/M Solutions Jurisdiction Report published by Sierra Research states that 32 states and the District of Columbia currently have vehicle emissions testing programs. Each state, as well as the District of Columbia, has its own regulatory structure for emissions testing with which we must comply if we conduct business in that state.
 
Public awareness of air pollution and its hazardous effects on human health and the environment has increased in recent years, which has led governmental authorities to pass more stringent pollution control measures. One especially effective measure that many governmental authorities have adopted is vehicle emissions testing. The EPA estimates that enhanced emissions testing on motor vehicles is approximately 10 times more cost-effective in reducing air pollution than increasing controls on stationary pollution sources such as factories and utilities. Consequently, the EPA has made emissions testing an integral part of its overall effort to reduce air pollution by ensuring that vehicles meet emissions standards.
 
Vehicle emissions control requirements have become progressively more stringent since the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970. In 1990, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to require areas that did not meet national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) to implement either basic or “enhanced” vehicle I/M emissions testing programs, depending upon the severity of the area’s air quality problem. The Act also required that metro areas with populations of more than 100,000 implement enhanced I/M emissions testing regardless of their air quality designation.
 
On November 5, 1992, the EPA issued its original rule establishing minimum performance and administrative requirements for states developing air quality implementation plans. The EPA said areas that needed enhanced emissions testing would have to use their new “I/M 240” test procedure. However, the EPA decided to grant state governmental authorities the discretion to determine how best to establish and operate a network of emissions testing facilities, including the flexibility to choose either a centralized or a decentralized program.
 
In general, these vehicle emissions tests are performed either in a centralized program or in a decentralized program. In a centralized program, a select number of emissions testing operators are either licensed or operated by certain states to perform vehicle emissions testing. These operators are authorized to perform emissions tests, but generally they are prohibited from repairing vehicles that fail to pass an emissions test.
 
On the other hand, in a decentralized program, a wider range of persons, including the Company, may perform emissions tests, including those engaged primarily in other businesses, such as automotive repair shops, oil change stores and others. For many of these operators, performing emissions tests is not their primary business.
 
Nineteen states have implemented decentralized programs, and 10 states and the District of Columbia have implemented centralized programs. There are three states that have implemented a hybrid program, whereby the state operates its own testing stations and also allows independently operated stations.

On July 31, 1998, the EPA issued a final study that concluded that more stringent air quality standards for motor vehicle emissions are needed, and that such standards should be implemented as it becomes technologically feasible and cost-effective to do so. We believe that the setting of such standards will be the most important EPA regulatory initiative affecting motor vehicles since the passage of the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act. We believe that the EPA study is likely to result in more stringent standards that will have the effect of increasing the number of areas that must implement emissions testing programs and thereby potentially increasing the market for our service.
 
Since 1977, when federal legislation first required states to comply with emissions standards through the use of testing programs, California has been a leader in testing procedures and technical standards. California has approximately 23 million vehicles subject to emissions testing, more than two times that of any other state. California’s testing program is overseen by the California Bureau of Automotive Repair (“CARB”). CARB has revised its emissions testing standards three times: in 1984, 1990, 1997 and 2010. With each of these revisions, CARB has required the use of new, more sophisticated and more accurate emissions testing and analysis equipment, which must be certified by CARB. California’s testing standards have become the benchmark for emissions testing in the United States.
 
All states with decentralized programs and many states with centralized programs require emissions testing and analysis equipment used in their programs to be BAR-97 certified, with all newly implemented enhanced programs requiring BAR-97 certification.
 
As emissions testing equipment has become more technologically advanced, government regulators have required that testing facilities use this more advanced equipment. The most significant technological advance that has occurred in the emissions testing industry over the past decade is the development of enhanced testing systems. Prior to 1990, the EPA required government agencies to test vehicles only for emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, which form smog. During this “basic” test, a technician inserts a probe in the vehicle’s tailpipe while the vehicle is idling and emissions analyzers then measure pollution levels in the exhaust. These basic tests worked well for pre-1981, non-computerized vehicles containing carburetors because typical emission control problems involved incorrect air/fuel mixtures and such problems increase pollution levels in the exhaust even when the vehicle is idling.
 
However, today’s vehicles have different emissions problems. For tests on modern vehicles to be effective, the equipment must measure nitrogen oxide emissions that also cause smog and must test the vehicle under simulated driving conditions. The EPA now requires these enhanced tests in the major metropolitan areas of 32 states and the District of Columbia. A technician conducts these ASM tests on a dynamometer, a treadmill-type device that simulates actual driving conditions, including periods of acceleration, deceleration and cruising, or the OBD by plugging into the vehicles computerized operation system.
 
 Emissions Testing in the State of Georgia
 
In 1996, the Environmental Protection Division of the State of Georgia initiated the GCAF program that required emissions testing of certain vehicles in a 13 county area surrounding metro Atlanta, Georgia. These rules are set forth in Sections 391-3-20-.01 through .22 of the Rules of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division.
 
Georgia’s program is a decentralized program. All operators performing emissions testing in Georgia must have their technicians attend and complete certain state certified training, and report to the state on their emissions testing activities every month. Testing stations may be licensed to test all vehicles, which are known as “All Vehicles Welcome” stations, or only vehicles not more than ten years old, known as “1996 or Newer Vehicles Only” stations. All the stations we currently operate in Georgia are “All Vehicles Welcome” stations, except for two of the stores acquired in the 2012 acquisition of five Georgia stores from AEE. The program requires vehicles in the 13 covered counties to undergo an emissions test on an annual basis, with an annual exemption for the three most recent model years.
 
The market for emissions testing in Georgia is highly fragmented and generally consists of services provided by independent auto repair service providers, service stations, oil and tire repair stores, and independent test-only facilities. According to GCAF, there are approximately 1,000 licensed test sites and approximately 2.6 million tests are performed annually in Georgia.
 
Georgia law mandates compliance with its vehicle emissions testing program. For vehicles subject to the state’s emissions law, a successful test, or a waiver from the state, is required to obtain a vehicle registration in Georgia. Nearly 2 million heavy polluting vehicles have been identified and repaired since the start of the program in 1996.
 
Emissions Testing and Safety Inspections in the State of Utah
 
The state of Utah allows a hybrid of the centralized and decentralized programs where the state operates a select number of emissions testing and safety inspection centers while authorizing those businesses such as an automotive repair shop, automobile dealers and others to conduct emissions testing and safety inspections. The Department of Health for each county manages emission testing and the Utah Highway Patrol manages the safety inspection program. The emissions tests conducted are the same as in Georgia.

All vehicles registered in Davis, Salt Lake, Utah, Weber, and Cache counties with model years less than six years old are required to have an emissions test once every two years. Vehicles with model years six years old and older (to 1975) must have an emissions test every year. Emissions’ testing is not required for vehicles with model years 1975 or older. Currently, vehicles with model years less than eight years old are required to have a safety inspection once every two years. Vehicles with model years eight years old and older must pass safety inspections every year. The Utah State Legislature passed an amended version of Utah House Bill 298, titled Motor Vehicle Safety Inspection Amendments on March 9, 2012, which amended Utah’s existing auto safety inspection law and became effective on January 1, 2013. The new bill requires vehicle safety inspections on vehicles which are four, eight and 10 years old, and then annually for the rest of the vehicle’s life, rather than  on odd/even model years for vehicles less than eight years old and annually for all other vehicles under the former law. Vehicle emissions testing laws in Utah were not impacted by Utah House Bill 298.
 
Utah law mandates compliance with its vehicle emissions and safety inspection program. For a vehicle to obtain a sticker for yearly registration, the owner must have a successful emissions and/or safety inspection.
 
On March 10, 2017 we closed our Salt Lake City, Utah, station under a lease termination agreement with the landlord.  As compensation for the early termination of the station’s lease, the Company received a cash payment of $250,000 on March 20, 2017.
 
 Emissions Testing and Safety Inspections in the State of Missouri
 
The state of Missouri’s Gateway Vehicle Inspection Program switched from a centralized program to a decentralized program on October 1, 2007. The program is administered by the Department of Natural Resources and the Missouri State Highway Patrol.
 
Missouri law requires all motor vehicles pass a vehicle safety inspection at an authorized inspection station every other year, unless specifically exempted from a safety inspection. New motor vehicles are exempt from the safety inspection during the first five years following the model year of manufacture.
 
In addition to the safety inspection, vehicles registered in St. Louis City, St. Louis County, St. Charles County, Franklin County and Jefferson County are required to have an emissions inspection every other year prior to registering the vehicle. New motor vehicles and the first retail sale of titled motor vehicles with less than 6,000 miles during the model year of the vehicle and the following year are exempt from the emissions inspection. Vehicles with a model year of 1995 and older are exempt from the ASM emissions inspections in Missouri. However, an emissions inspection is required regardless of the model year if the vehicle is sold.
 
Operating Strategy
 
Our operating strategy focuses on (a) providing our customers with fast, honest and courteous vehicle testing and inspection services, (b) increasing the volume of business at each site, (c) creating brand awareness for our services and (d) creating repeat customer sales, all of which are designed to enhance our revenue and cash flow. To achieve these goals, we:

• | Seek to secure and maintain emissions testing and safety inspection stations at well-traveled intersections and other locations that are easily accessible by our customers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Coordinate operations, training and local outreach programs in each market to enhance revenue and maximize cost efficiencies within each market;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Implement regional management and marketing initiatives in each of our markets;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tailor each facility and use local advertising to describe the services we offer to appeal to the broadest range of consumers; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Aspire to expand the use of our mobile vehicle testing units by bidding on federal, state, and local governments for their fleet vehicles, as well as corporate accounts and automotive dealerships.

We currently purchase our raw materials, such as filters, hoses, etc., from several suppliers and, because these raw materials are readily available from a variety of suppliers, we do not rely upon any one supplier for a significant portion of our materials. Certificates of emissions and safety inspections are purchased from each state’s department or agency responsible for overseeing the emissions testing and safety inspections programs in that state.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have registered the trade names “Speedemissions”, “Just Emissions” and “Carbonga” in the United States.

Competition
 
The emissions testing and safety inspection industry contains numerous small owner-operators. Auto repair shops, tire stores, oil change stores, muffler shops, service stations, and other emissions testing stations may offer this service. There are also several national competitors at this time, including national oil change companies which perform emissions testing services. We expect competition from local operators at all of our locations. We estimate our total number of competitors to be several thousand across all the markets in which we operate. We expect such competition whenever and wherever we open or acquire a station. Our market share is too small to measure. Our revenue from emissions testing is affected primarily by the number of emissions and safety tests our stations perform, and the price charged per test. Other emissions testing operators may have greater financial resources than us, which may allow them to obtain more expensive and advantageous locations for testing stations, provide services in addition to emissions testing, charge lower prices, and advertise and promote their businesses more effectively than we do. For example, some of our competitors in Atlanta charge only $15.00 to test a vehicle’s emissions rather than the $25.00 maximum allowed under Georgia law. As a result, we have had to reduce or discount our fees in some of our Atlanta stations. We intend to compete by creating brand awareness through advertising, standard building style and facade, consistent color scheme and uniform, and superior customer experience. Although we believe our stations are well positioned to compete, we cannot assure you that our stations will maintain, or increase, their current testing volumes and revenues.
 Research and Development
 
We have not spent any material amount of time or money on research and development, and do not anticipate doing so in the future.
 
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
There are no environmental laws applicable to the vehicle emissions and safety inspection business.
 
Employees
 
At December 31, 2016, we employed 43 full-time and part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a union.
