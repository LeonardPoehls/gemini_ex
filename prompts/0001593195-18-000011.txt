Item 1. Business
Overview
tronc, Inc., formerly Tribune Publishing Company, was formed as a Delaware corporation on November 21, 2013. tronc, Inc., and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “tronc”) is a media company rooted in award-winning journalism. Headquartered in Chicago, tronc operates newsrooms in ten of the nation’s largest markets with titles including the Chicago Tribune, The Baltimore Sun, Orlando Sentinel, South Florida’s Sun Sentinel, Newport News, Virginia’s Daily Press, Allentown, Pennsylvania’s The Morning Call, Hartford Courant, Los Angeles Times, and The San Diego Union Tribune. On September 3, 2017, the Company completed the purchase of the New York Daily News, New York City’s “Hometown Newspaper”. tronc’s legacy of brands, including the New York Daily News, has earned a combined 105 Pulitzer Prizes and is committed to informing, inspiring and engaging local communities.
On February 7, 2018, tronc entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “MIPA”), by and between the Company and Nant Capital, LLC (“Nant Capital”), pursuant to which the Company will sell the Los Angeles Times, The San Diego Union-Tribune and various other of the Company’s California titles to Nant Capital for an aggregate purchase price of $500 million in cash plus the assumption of $90 million in underfunded pension liabilities (the “Nant Transaction”).  The Nant Transaction is expected to close in the late first quarter or early second quarter of 2018.
Since these properties were not assets held for sale or discontinued operations as of December 31, 2017, any discussions of the business of the Company and all reported financial and operating results and metrics reflect inclusion of the Los Angeles Times and The San Diego Union-Tribune.
tronc’s brands create and distribute content across its media portfolio, offering integrated marketing, media, and business services to consumers and advertisers, including digital solutions and advertising opportunities.The Company’s results of operations, when examined on a quarterly basis, reflect the seasonality of tronc’s revenues. Second and fourth quarter advertising revenues are typically higher than first and third quarter revenues. Results for the second quarter reflect spring advertising revenues, while the fourth quarter includes advertising revenues related to the holiday season.
tronc manages its business as two distinct segments, troncM and troncX. troncM is comprised of the Company’s media groups excluding their digital revenues and related digital expenses, except digital subscription revenues when bundled 
2

with a print subscription. troncX includes the Company’s digital revenues and related digital expenses from local websites and mobile applications, digital only subscriptions, as well as Tribune Content Agency (“TCA”) and forsalebyowner.com.
troncM
troncM’s media groups include the Chicago Tribune Media Group, the New York Daily News Media Group, the Sun Sentinel Media Group, the Orlando Sentinel Media Group, The Baltimore Sun Media Group, the Hartford Courant Media Group, the Morning Call Media Group, the Daily Press Media Group, the Los Angeles Times Media Group, and the San Diego Media Group. tronc’s major daily newspapers have served their respective communities with local, regional, national and international news and information for more than 150 years. The Hartford Courant is the nation’s oldest continuously published newspaper and celebrated its 250th anniversary in October 2014.
In the year ended December 31, 2017, 44.9% of troncM’s operating revenues were derived from advertising. These revenues were generated from the sale of advertising space in published issues of the newspapers and from the delivery of preprinted advertising supplements. Approximately 39.5% of operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were generated from the sale of newspapers and other owned publications to individual subscribers or to sales outlets that re-sell the newspapers. The remaining 15.6% of operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were generated from the provision of commercial printing and delivery services to other newspapers, direct mail advertising and services, and other related activities.
Newspaper print advertising is typically in the form of display, classified or preprint advertising. Advertising and marketing services revenues are comprised of three basic categories: retail, national and classified. Retail is a category of customers who tend to do business directly with the general public. National is a category of customers who tend to do business directly with other businesses. Classified is a type of advertising which is other than display or preprint.
Circulation revenue results from the sale of print editions of newspapers to individual subscribers and the sale of print editions of newspapers to sales outlets that re-sell the newspapers.
Other revenues are derived from commercial printing and delivery services provided to other newspapers, direct mail advertising and services and other related activities. The Company contracts with a number of national and local newspapers to both print and distribute their respective publications in local markets where it is a newspaper publisher. In some instances where it prints publications, it also manages and procures newsprint, ink and plates on their behalf. These arrangements allow the Company to leverage its investment in infrastructure utilized for its own publications. As a result, these arrangements tend to contribute incremental profitability and revenues. The Company currently distributes national newspapers (including The New York Times, USA Today, and The Wall Street Journal) in some of its local markets under multiple agreements. Additionally, in Chicago, New York, Hartford, Fort Lauderdale and Los Angeles, the Company provides some or all of these services to other local publications.

troncX Acquisitions
In December 2016, the Company completed acquisitions totaling $7.6 million of Spanfeller Media, a digital platform which includes The Daily Meal and The Active Times, and other immaterial properties. For further information regarding the Company’s acquisitions, see Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Competition 
Each of the Company’s ten major daily newspapers holds a leading market position in their respective DMAs, or designated market areas, as determined by Nielsen, and competes for readership and advertising with both local or community newspapers as well as national newspapers and other traditional and web-based media sources. The Company faces competition for both advertising dollars and consumers’ dollars and attention.
The competition for advertising dollars comes from local, regional, and national newspapers, digital platforms that have content, search, aggregation and social media functionalities, magazines, broadcast, cable and satellite television, radio, direct mail, yellow pages, outdoor, and other media as advertisers adjust their spending based on the perceived value of the audience reached and the cost to reach that audience.
The secular shift impacting how content is consumed, including the ubiquity of mobile platforms, has led to increased competition from a wide variety of new digital content offerings, many of which are often free to users. Besides price, variables impacting customer acquisition and retention include the quality and nature of the user experience and the quality of the content offered.
To address the structural shift to digital media, the Company provides editorial content on a wide variety of platforms and formats - from the printed daily newspaper to leading local websites; on social network sites such as Facebook, Apple News and Twitter; on smartphones, tablets and e-readers; on websites and blogs; in niche online publications and in e-mail newsletters.
Raw Materials
As a publisher of newspapers, tronc utilizes substantial quantities of various types of paper. During 2017, we consumed approximately 137 thousand metric tons of newsprint. We currently obtain substantially all of our newsprint from one North American supplier, primarily under a long-term contract. Substantially all of our paper purchasing is done through a national purchasing aggregator who then draws upon Canadian and U.S. based newsprint producers. We believe that our current source of paper supply is adequate. Our earnings are sensitive to changes in newsprint prices. Newsprint and ink expense accounted for 6.5% of total operating expenses in fiscal year 2017.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 6,581 full-time and part-time employees, including approximately 1,097 employees represented by various employee unions. We believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory. Subsequent to 2017 year-end approximately 400 editorial employees at the Los Angeles Times voted to be represented by a union and will soon begin negotiating a collective bargaining agreement.
Intellectual Property
Currently, our operations are generally not reliant on patents owned by third parties. However, because we operate a large number of websites and mobile applications in high-visibility markets, we do defend patent litigation, from time to time, brought primarily by non-practicing entities, as opposed to marketplace competitors. We have sought patent protection in certain instances; however, we do not consider patents to be material to our business as a whole. Of greater importance to our overall business are the federal, international and state trademark registrations and applications that protect, along with our common law rights, our brands, certain of which are long-standing and well known, such as Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News and The Hartford Courant. Generally, the duration of a trademark registration is perpetual if it is renewed on a timely basis and continues to be used properly as a trademark. We also own a large number of copyrights, none of which individually is material to the business. We maintain certain licensing and content sharing relationships with third-party content providers that allow us to produce the particular content mix we provide to our customers in our markets. The Company entered into a number of agreements with Tribune Media Company, formerly Tribune Company (“TCO”), 
6

or its subsidiaries that provide for licenses to certain intellectual property, and in particular, we entered into a license agreement with TCO that provides a non-exclusive, royalty-free license for us to use certain trademarks, service marks and trade names, including the Tribune name. Other than the foregoing and commercially available software licenses, we do not believe that any of our licenses to third-party intellectual property are material to our business as a whole.
Restructuring and Spin-off from Tribune Media Company
On December 8, 2008 (the “Petition Date”), TCO, and 110 of its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (each a “Debtor” and, collectively, the “Debtors”), filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 (“Chapter 11”) of title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”). A joint plan of reorganization for the Debtors (the “Plan”) became effective and the Debtors emerged from Chapter 11 on December 31, 2012 (the “Effective Date”). Certain of the legal entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of tronc were Debtors or, as a result of the restructuring transactions undertaken pursuant to the Plan, are successor legal entities to legal entities that were Debtors (collectively, the “tronc Debtors”). As of August 12, 2016, all of the tronc Debtor cases have been closed by final decree issued by the Bankruptcy Court. The remaining Chapter 11 cases relate to Debtors and successor legal entities that are subsidiaries of TCO and the cases continue to be administered under the caption “In re: Tribune Media Company, et al.,” Case No. 08-13141.
On July 10, 2013, TCO announced its plan to spin-off essentially all of its publishing business into an independent company (the “Distribution”). The business represented the principal publishing operations of TCO and certain other entities wholly-owned by TCO and was organized as a new company. On August 4, 2014 (“Distribution Date”), TCO completed the spin-off of its principal publishing operations into tronc, by distributing 98.5% of the outstanding shares of tronc common stock to holders of TCO common stock and warrants. Based on the number of shares of TCO common stock and TCO warrants outstanding as of 5:00 P.M. Eastern time on July 28, 2014 and the distribution ratio, 25,042,263 shares of tronc common stock were distributed to the TCO stockholders and holders of TCO warrants and TCO retained 381,354 shares of tronc common stock, representing 1.5% of outstanding common stock of tronc. In connection with the spin-off, tronc paid a $275.0 million cash dividend to TCO from a portion of the proceeds of a senior secured credit facility entered into by the Company.
