Principal Products, Services and Their Markets
 
We plan to develop a business that specializes in marketing health and wellness vacations to both individuals and corporate groups that are looking to find a more holistic life balance. Our company is looking to establish a niche in the travel market that caters to sustained wellness and rejuvenation, recognizing the need for a better life-work combination.
 
We intend to source like-minded partners that currently operate in resort destinations that are established in these types of wellness services. The ‘Med’ in Med Spa stands for Medicinal. ‘Medicinal relates to active resort destinations defined by outstanding beauty and tranquility, that also have an established network of wellness providers, such as certified massage therapists, yoga instructors, fitness coaches and nutritionists. Our overarching goal is to not only provide a vacation experience that will allow our customers to escape the stresses of everyday life, but also to provide an experience that will enable them to take away valuable life skills empowering them to lead long term a more balanced life.
 
We have done preliminary research into resort destinations such as Whistler, C, Sedona, AZ, Palm Desert, CA, San Diego, CA,, and Mont Tremblant Quebec. Our ultimate goal is to source resort partners from across the Continent, and provide access to major urban markets.. Much of the marketing will be done on-line; however, rather than just providing a referral type service, Med Spa will act as a ‘Wellness Concierge’ to custom tailor packages to the individual needs of our guests. Each guest inquiry to Med Spa Vacations will initiate a thorough consultation process to identify their potential wellness goals, and determine what services and potential destinations might best fulfill their unique needs.

Our goal is not to become one of the many wholesale travel package companies that currently exist. Our goal is to establish a niche service and wellness brand, developing crucial long-term relationships with our clients, and become their go-to resource for lifestyle oriented escapes. We believe we can simultaneously maintain our focus on developing holistic vacation experiences for positive lifestyle change, while establishing loyal clientele that will eventually create a profitable business.
 
Our company will also market the potential for individual lifestyle change within the corporate environment, and subsequently offer motivational retreats or company retreats. We will offer experiences directed towards collective motivation, goal setting and realizing targets. These corporately-tailored experiences may also be an employee reward for top performers, with secondary gains brought back to the workplace through personal growth.
 
To further our vision of creating a long-term network of repeat guests, we will consider the implementation of a ‘Med Spa Life’ membership for yearly access and priority promotions. For an as yet to be determined yearly fee, customers will receive enhanced Wellness Concierge services with numerous upgrades and bonus services included with the resort packages they select. Med Spa Life is drawing developmental concepts both in form and function from the timeshare/vacation ownership industry. There are opportunities to purchase distressed timeshare weeks currently being held by non-solvent equity holders. Our company is interested in acquiring such opportunities to support our Med Spa Life wellness memberships. If one of our members wishes to go to a specific resort in a given year, our company would utilize its bank of timeshare weeks to fulfill accommodations requests. Preferred rates and discounts will also be brokered with the wellness providers, and their services will be paid for by our company out of our pooled reserve of membership funds. The objective of this program is multifold: members can pay in advance for their wellness retreats, and also obligate themselves for future programs, while our company can also secure its future accommodation needs through the acquisition of distressed timeshare weeks. Our company will also be able to generate working capital from the initial sale of memberships. To date, the Company has rated this initiative as secondary to the primary goal of establishing and securing reliable resort partners and wellness providers. Our primary goal must be achieved before we can implement the second. 
 
However, all aspects of our marketing will ultimately be geared to the generation of a ‘Med Spa Life’ member. Toward the end of each guest’s stay, our personally appointed Wellness Concierge will follow up to ensure that the experience expectations were realized (for ongoing quality assurance), and to introduce the potential of enhanced Med Spa Life membership - with potential on-the-spot discounts for their current stay as a marketing incentive to purchase. Corporate customers will also be offered promotional ‘Med Spa Life’ memberships, when they participate in our wellness getaways. Establishing an outstanding wellness experience for our guests and members will provide an opportunity to create a larger network of like-minded individuals seeking a better and more balanced life.
 
Distribution Methods
 
Potential customers will find Med Spa Vacations primarily through an on-line campaign that will leverage our website, www.medspavacations.com. On-line ads and marketing platforms such as Google Adwords and Facebook will be employed in our initial campaign. It is also anticipated that as our marketing takes hold and customers start to enjoy our services that a referral network will be created.
Status of Publicly Announced New Products or Services
 
We have no new publicly announced products or services.
 
Competitive Business Conditions and Strategy; Med Spa Vacations' Position in the Industry
 
Med Spa Vacations would in theory compete with the broader market of travel providers. Businesses such as Booking.com, Expedia.com, and other on-line vacation purveyors may compete with Med Spa Vacations for customers. Also, travel agents and adventure companies would also compete with us in travel marketing. If fact, any business that aggregates travel and markets it to the general public would be in competition with Med Spa Vacations; however, we are targeting a very specialized market, and we believe that there is a growing awareness and need for wellness-style vacationing.

We will do an initial test marketing campaign in the West Coast cities of Seattle and San Francisco. These two urban centers have affluent demographics, and can also be viewed as being progressive when it comes to the acceptance of alternative ideas regarding health and wellness. These two cities are also relatively close to three resort destinations that we have identified as initial test locations: Whistler BC, Palm Desert, CA, and Sedona AZ. Each of these destinations has an established network of wellness services that can be offered to our guests. These resorts also have timeshare activity with a supply of weeks available to purchase.
 
Our business model in the start-up phase would be to identify partner resorts and wellness providers, and negotiate preferred room and service rates. We would then utilize the negotiated rates and add reasonable margins into our final pricing. If and when we develop volume in our business, we will attempt to negotiate progressively better service-provider discounts. To further this goal, in the fall of 2016, the Company booked vacations for a select group of secret shoppers. For a discounted price, we sent couples traveling to our partner destinations to experience both our accommodations and wellness services. The initial feedback from our secret shopper initiative identified areas of weakness and the need to further vet our providers. This vetting effort is still ongoing.
 
Talent Sources and Names of Principal Suppliers
 
The key to our success will be in the quality of our leadership and the degree to which we excel in our customer service. Blaine Redfern, as President of our company, is a resort industry professional. He currently works for Wyndham Resorts and Hotels, managing two properties in the Greater San Diego area. Mr. Redfern has a wide network of resort industry contacts, and will bring these to bear in support of this project. And Morgan Powell, Secretary, is a New York based marketing professional who will bring his business acumen and organizational skills to assist in the implementation of the business plan.
 
For principal suppliers, the Company will rely on an as yet to be constructed network of resort destination partners. We are targeting beautiful destinations that are in close proximity to larger urban centers. Our prospective resort destinations must also have existing wellness providers in the area that we can contract to perform our services. Our goal is to have multiple destinations, and a wide network of wellness providers, so as to not be dependent on any particular place or person.
 
Dependence on one or a few major customers
 
Med Spa Vacations will not be dependent on any one service provider or group of customers. Both our test markets and array of wellness providers will be expanded over time.
 
Seasonality
 
There will be seasonality in our business cycle. Special discount travel packages will be offered in the off-seasons; however, business will inevitably decline during these periods. The ‘off-season,’ as described, does vary from resort to resort. For example: in Palm Springs, CA and Sedona, AZ, the off season is in the summer. In our selected mountain resorts, the ‘off-seasons’ would be October and November, as well as May and June. We will be sensitive to the off-season in each of our locations, and structure our offers accordingly. And as related, it may be possible to come up with enticing deals during these periods, as the wellness providers in each of these markets will be seeking additional business.
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Agreements or Contracts
 
There are no aspects of our business plan which require a patent or trademark. We have not entered into any vendor agreements or contracts that give or could give rise to any obligations or concessions.
Governmental Controls, Approval and Licensing Requirements
 
We are not currently subject to direct federal, state or local regulation other than the requirement to have a business license for the areas in which we conduct business.
Employees
 
We have no employees. Our officers and directors furnish their time to the development of the Company at no cost.
