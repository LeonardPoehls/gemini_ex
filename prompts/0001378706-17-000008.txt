Item 1. Business.
The Company
American DG Energy Inc., or the Company, ADGE, we, our, or us, was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 24, 2001. Our principal executive offices are located in Waltham, Massachusetts. We install, own, operate and maintain complete distributed generation, or DG systems or energy systems, and other complementary systems at customer sites and sell electricity, hot water, heat and cooling energy under long-term contracts at prices guaranteed to the customer to be below conventional utility rates. As of December 31, 2016, we had 92 installed energy systems, representing an aggregate of approximately 5,445 kilowatts, or kW, 41.6 million British thermal units, or MMBtu's, of heat and hot water and 4,500 tons of cooling. kW is a measure of electricity generated, MMBtu is a measure of heat generated and a ton is a measure of cooling generated. 
Recent Developments
Disposition of Interest in Eurosite Power
In July 2010, we established EuroSite Power Inc., or EuroSite, as a subsidiary to introduce our On-Site Utility solution into the European market. As of December 31, 2015, we owned an approximately 48% interest in EuroSite and, as required under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, consolidated the financial statements of EuroSite into our consolidated financial statements and did so through the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Since inception, the Company provided United States’ accounting, finance, and legal assistance to EuroSite from its office in Waltham, Massachusetts. During the second and third quarters of 2016, we entered into the following transactions that had the effect of reducing our ownership interest in EuroSite to slightly above 2%:

• | On May 4, 2016, we entered into an agreement with John Hatsopoulos, our co-Chief Executive Officer, a director and principal stockholder, and another investor to exchange an aggregate of $9.3 million in principal and prepaid interest under outstanding 2014 Senior Unsecured Debentures (“Senior Unsecured Debentures”) held by them for an aggregate of approximately 14.72 million shares of EuroSite owned by us.


• | On June 28, 2016, our ownership interest in EuroSite was reduced to 20.5% as a result of the conversion of substantially all of the outstanding convertible debentures of Eurosite that had been guaranteed by the Company into shares of common stock of EuroSite. Following such conversion, the Company accounted for its interest in EuroSite in its consolidated financial statements under the equity method of accounting. 


• | On September 30, 2016, holders of our outstanding 6% convertible notes (“convertible notes”) agreed to exchange principal and prepaid interest in the aggregate amount of approximately $4.3 million under such notes for an aggregate of 9,700,000 shares of common stock of EuroSite owned by us.


• | On September 30, 2016, we sold an aggregate of 5,500,000 shares of common stock of EuroSite owned by us to two investors for an aggregate of $2.2 million, the proceeds of which were paid to further reduce the amount of our outstanding convertible notes. As part of such transaction, the former convertible note holders cancelled warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,020,000 shares of common stock of EuroSite we had issued to such holders. 

As a result of such transactions, our ownership interest in EuroSite was decreased to approximately 2.03% and, pursuant to GAAP, we presented EuroSite as discontinued operations. Accordingly, the financial statements and other information related to EuroSite have not been consolidated with our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, included in this report.

Repayment and Settlement of Convertible Debentures and Notes
During 2016, we effected the following transactions to substantially reduce the amount of our outstanding indebtedness:

• | On May 4, 2016, as discussed above, we exchanged an aggregate of $9.3 million in principal and prepaid interest under outstanding Senior Unsecured Debentures for an aggregate of approximately 14.72 million shares of EuroSite owned by us. Following the exchange, the debentures were cancelled. 


• | On September 30, 2016, holders of our outstanding 6% convertible notes exchanged $4.3 million in principal and prepaid interest for 9,700,000 shares of EuroSite owned by us and we issued a new note to evidence the remaining balance of the debt of $3,418,681. The prior convertible note was cancelled by us. The new note was upon substantially the same terms as the 6% convertible note and was convertible into our shares at a price of $2.11 per share, subject to certain adjustments in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, and certain other events. 


• | On September 30, 2016, as discussed above, we used the $2.2 million proceeds from the sale of 5.5 million shares of EuroSite to further reduce the amount of our outstanding convertible notes.


• | On December 23, 2016, we repaid the remaining outstanding balance of our outstanding convertible notes of approximately $3.1 million (net of prepaid interest).

Revolving Line of Credit Provided by Our Co-CEO, Director and Principal Stockholder
On December 22, 2016, we entered into a revolving line of credit agreement with John Hatsopoulos, our co-CEO, a director and a principal stockholder. The original amount of the line of credit was $3 million. We drew down $850,000 under the line of credit. On February 27, 2017, Mr. Hatsopoulos advised us that he was terminating the line of credit agreement except to the extent of the current draw down. The line of credit bears interest at the rate of 6% per annum on the outstanding balance, and is due on the first day of each calendar quarter. The line of credit terminates May 25, 2018 and the principal and any unpaid interest is repayable on that date. An event of default under the line of credit occurs in the event any amount of principal or interest is not paid when due.
Proposed Merger with Tecogen.ADGE Acquisition Corp.
On November 1, 2016, ADGE entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Tecogen, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Tecogen”), and Tecogen.ADGE Acquisition Corp. Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Tecogen (“Merger Sub”) formed for the purpose of effecting the merger. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Merger Sub will be merged with and into ADGE (the “Merger”). with ADGE continuing as the surviving company in the Merger. Following the Merger, ADGE will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tecogen. The Merger Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of ADGE's proposed acquisition by Tecogen. 
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each of ADGE's shares of common stock, $.001 par value per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into the right to receive $.092 shares of common stock, $.001 par value per share, of Tecogen (the “Exchange Ratio”). The number of shares of Tecogen common stock may be subject to adjustment in the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar event with respect to the number of ADGE's or Tecogen’s shares outstanding after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the effective time of the Merger. Options to acquire ADGE's shares of common stock and restricted stock awards with respect to ADGE's shares of common stock granted before the effective time of the Merger will remain in effect until they expire or are terminated and shall be exercisable for or relate to a number of shares of common stock of Tecogen equal to the Exchange Ratio, as adjusted.
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of Tecogen and ADGE relating to the respective business and public filings of Tecogen and ADGE. In addition, the Merger Agreement provides for customary pre-closing covenants of ADGE and Tecogen, including covenants relating to conducting the respective businesses of ADGE and Tecogen in all material respects in the ordinary course of business in accordance with past practice and to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in all material respects ADGE’s and Tecogen’s assets and properties in their current condition.
Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by ADGE's stockholders and the stockholders of Tecogen, the Merger Agreement and Merger may be abandoned by either ADGE or Tecogen pursuant to a resolution of the respective board of 
3

AMERICAN DG ENERGY INC.

directors of such companies to withdraw or fail to make when required under the Merger Agreement or fail to include in the joint proxy statement/prospectus for the Merger, a recommendation that the stockholders of such company adopt the Merger Agreement. Also, ADGE may terminate the Merger Agreement in the event ADGE board approves, recommends or declares advisable, or proposes publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable a competing proposal or offer by a third party to purchase 20% or more of the assets or outstanding capital stock, other equity securities, or voting power, of ADGE, or any merger, business combination, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization or similar transaction as a result of which the holders of ADGE's common stock immediately prior to the transaction do not own at least 80% of the outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity in such transaction after the consummation of the transaction (“competing proposal”). The foregoing is subject to compliance with written notice of termination and the furnishing of the reasons for such termination. In the event of a termination, there shall be no liability on the part of the terminating party to the other party or parties except in the case of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. 
The Merger Agreement does not provide for the payment by ADGE of a breakup or termination fee in the event of such a termination.
Also, the Merger Agreement contains a “go shop” provision, pursuant to which, following the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by ADGE's and Tecogen’s stockholders, ADGE and ADGE's officers, directors, employees, financial and other advisors may initiate or solicit a competing proposal.
Further, the Merger Agreement provides that at any time before the closing of the Merger, either ADGE's or Tecogen's board of directors may terminate the Merger Agreement if such board (or a committee of such board) has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and legal counsel ("advisors"), that there is a reasonable probability the failure to take such action would cause the board of ADGE or Tecogen, as the case may be, to violate its fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable law. The Merger Agreement requires the terminating company to provide ten days’ prior written notice; the terminating company (or its representative) is required to negotiate in good faith with the other party during the five day business day period after giving such notice to the extent such other party wishes to negotiate and, in the case of a termination by ADGE’s board, and to the extent Tecogen wishes to negotiate, to enable Tecogen to propose in writing a binding offer to effect revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement that would obviate the need for a termination by ADGE, and, in the case of a termination by the board of Tecogen, to enable both companies to agree to revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement that would obviate the need for a termination by Tecogen At the end of the notice period, the terminating company’s board (or committee), is required to have considered in good faith any such binding offer, and to have determined in good faith, after consultation with its advisors, that there is a reasonable probability the failure to effect the termination would cause such board to violate its fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable law. In the event of such a termination by either party there shall be no liability on the part of the terminating party to the other party or parties except in the case of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.
Consummation of the Merger is subject to a number of customary conditions including, among others, conditions relating to the approval of the Merger by the requisite vote of ADGE's stockholders and the stockholders of Tecogen; the receipt of all required regulatory approvals; and the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 of Tecogen related to the Merger. 
In connection with the proposed Merger, on December 21, 2016, Tecogen filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC and, on January 27, 2017, filed an Amendment No. 1 to the Form S-4 registration statement. The Form S-4 registration statement relates to the registration of the shares of Tecogen to be issued in the Merger and includes a joint proxy statement/prospectus pursuant to which ADGE and Tecogen will solicit the votes of stockholders related to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the respective stockholders of ADGE and Tecogen at separate special meetings of such stockholders.  ADGE and Tecogen expect to make the joint proxy statement/prospectus available to their respective stockholders and to file other documents regarding the proposed Merger with the SEC, including one or more further amendments to the Form S-4 registration statement.  This is not intended to be, and is not, a substitute for such filings or for any other document that ADGE or Tecogen may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed Merger.  Stockholders of ADGE are urged to read all relevant documents filed with the SEC, including the effective registration statement and the joint proxy statement/prospectus contained therein carefully when they become available, because they will contain important information about Tecogen, ADGE, and the proposed Merger.  Investors and security holders will be able to obtain copies of the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus as well as other filings containing information about Tecogen, ADGE, and the Merger once they become available, without charge, at the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov.  Copies of documents filed with the SEC by Tecogen will be made available free of charge on Tecogen’s investor relations website at http://ir.tecogen.com/all-sec-filings. Copies of documents filed with the SEC by ADGE will be made available free of charge on our financial reporting website at http://investors.americandg.com/sec.

Company Overview
We distribute, own and operate clean, on-site energy systems that produce electricity, hot water, heat, and cooling. Our business model is to own the equipment that we install at customers' facilities and to sell the energy produced by these systems to customers on a long-term contractual basis. We call this business the “On-Site Utility.”
We offer natural gas powered cogeneration systems that are reliable and energy efficient. Our cogeneration systems produce electricity from an internal combustion engine driving a generator, while the heat from the engine and exhaust is recovered and typically used to produce heat and hot water for use on-site. We also distribute and operate water chiller systems for building cooling applications that operate in a similar manner, except the engines in the water chiller systems drive a large air-conditioning compressor while recovering heat for hot water. Cogeneration systems reduce the amount of electricity that a customer must purchase from the local utility and produce valuable heat and hot water on-site to use as required. By simultaneously providing electricity, hot water and heat, cogeneration systems also have a significant, positive impact on the environment by reducing the carbon dioxide, or CO2, produced by replacing a portion of the traditional energy supplied by the electric grid and conventional hot water boilers.
Distributed generation of electricity, or DG, often referred to as cogeneration systems or combined heat and power systems, or CHP, is an attractive option for reducing energy costs and increasing the reliability of available energy. DG has been successfully implemented by others in large industrial installations over 10 Megawatts, or MW, where the market has been growing for a number of years, and is increasingly being accepted in smaller sized units because of technology improvements, increased energy costs, and better DG economics. We believe that our target market (users of up to 1 MW) has been barely penetrated and that the reduced reliability of the utility grid, increasing cost pressures experienced by energy users, advances in new, low cost technologies, and DG-favorable legislation and regulation at the state and federal level will drive our near-term growth and penetration of the target market. The Company maintains a website at www.americandg.com.

Our website address included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or this Annual Report, is a textual reference only, and the information in the website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.
We believe that our primary opportunity for DG energy and equipment sales is where commercial electricity rates exceed $0.12 per kW hour, or kWh, which is predominantly in the Northeast and California. Attractive DG economics are currently attainable in applications that include hospitals, nursing homes, multi-tenant residential housing, hotels, schools and colleges, recreational facilities, food processing plants, dairies, and other light industrial facilities. 
We believe that the largest number of potential DG users in the U.S. require less than 1 MW of electric power and less than 1,200 tons of cooling capacity. We are able to design our systems to suit a particular customer's needs because of our ability to place multiple units at a site. This approach is part of what allows our products and services to meet changing power and cooling demands throughout the day (also from season-to-season) and greatly improves efficiency. 
We purchase energy equipment from various suppliers. The primary type of equipment we use in our energy systems is a natural gas-powered, reciprocating engine supplied by Tecogen. We believe that our supply arrangements with Tecogen have been negotiated on an arm's length basis, and we also believe there are enough alternative vendors of CHP equipment to satisfy the Company's needs of the supply arrangement if Tecogen were to terminate for any reason. See Financial Statements, Note 10 "Related Parties" for additional information. A CHP system simultaneously produces two types of energy - heat and electricity - from a single fuel source, generally natural gas. The two key components of a CHP system are an internal combustion reciprocating engine and an electric generator. The clean natural gas fired engine spins a generator to produce electricity. The natural byproduct of the working engine is heat. The heat is captured and used to supply space heating, domestic hot water heating, laundry hot water, or heating for swimming pools and spas. 
As power sources that use alternative energy technologies mature to the point when they are both reliable and economical, we will consider employing them to supply energy for our customers. We regularly assess the technical, economic, reliability, and emissions issues associated with systems that use solar, micro-turbine, or fuel cell technologies to generate power.
Background and Market
We believe the delivery of energy services to commercial and residential customers in the United States has evolved over many decades into an inefficient and increasingly unreliable structure. Power for lighting, air conditioning, refrigeration, communications, and computing demands comes almost exclusively from centralized power plants serving users through a complex grid of transmission and distribution lines and substations. Even with continuous improvements in central station generation and transmission technologies, we believe today's power industry is inefficient compared to DG. Coal accounts for more than half of all electric power generation, so, consequently, we believe these inefficiencies are a major contributor to rising atmospheric CO2 emissions. As countermeasures are sought to limit global warming, it is expected that environmental pressures against coal will favor the deployment of alternative energy technologies.
On-site boilers and furnaces burning either natural gas or petroleum distillate fuels produce most thermal energy for space heating and hot water services. This separation of thermal and electrical energy supply services has persisted despite a general recognition that CHP can be significantly more energy efficient than central generation of electricity by itself. Except in large-scale industrial applications (e.g., paper and chemical manufacturing), cogeneration has not yet attained general acceptance. This is due, in part, because the technologies previously available for small on-site cogeneration systems were incapable of delivering the reliability, cost and environmental performance necessary to displace or even substantially modify the established power industry structure.
Due to these factors, electricity reserve margins have declined, and the reliability of service has begun to deteriorate, particularly in regions of high economic growth. Widespread acceptance of computing and communications technologies by consumers and commercial users has further increased the demand for electricity, while also creating new requirements for very high power quality and reliability. At the same time, technological advances in emission control, microprocessors, and internet technologies have sharply altered the competitive balance between centralized generation and DG. These fundamental shifts in economics and requirements are key to the emerging opportunity for DG equipment and services.

AMERICAN DG ENERGY INC.

The Role of DG
DG is the production of two sources or two types of energy (electricity or cooling and heat) from a single energy source (natural gas). We use technology that utilizes a low-cost, mass-produced, internal combustion engine from General Motors, used primarily in light trucks and sport utility vehicles that is modified to run on natural gas. The engine spins either a standard generator to produce electricity, or a conventional compressor to produce cooling. For heating, because the working engine generates heat, we capture the byproduct heat with a heat exchanger and utilize the heat for facility applications in the form of space heating and hot water for buildings or industrial facilities. Standard refrigeration and cooling equipment uses an electric motor to spin a conventional compressor, but we replace the standard electric motor with a modified internal combustion engine, as described above, that runs on natural gas.
DG refers to the application of small-scale energy production systems, including electricity generators, at locations in close proximity to the end-use loads that they serve. Integrated energy systems, operating at user sites but interconnected to existing electric distribution networks, can reduce demand on the nation's utility grid, increase energy efficiency, avoid the waste inherent in long distance wire and cable transmission of electricity, reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and protect against power outages, while, in most cases, significantly lowering utility costs for power users and building operators.
Until recently, many DG technologies have not been a feasible alternative to traditional energy sources because of economic, technological, and regulatory considerations.
We supply cogeneration systems that are capable of meeting the demands of commercial users and that can be connected to the existing utility grid. Specific advantages of the Company's on-site DG systems, compared with traditional centralized generation and distribution of electricity alone, include the following:

• | Greatly increased overall energy efficiency (up to 90% - see Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI), Energy Generation and Distribution Efficiency, available at http://www.eesi.org/generation_distribution. This website address and any other website addresses included in this Annual Report are included as textual references only and the information in such websites is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report).


• | Rapid adaptation to changing demand requirements (e.g., weeks, not years, to add new generating capacity where and when it is needed).


• | Ability to by-pass transmission line and substation bottlenecks in congested service areas.


• | Avoidance of site and right-of-way issues affecting large-scale power generation and distribution projects.


• | Clean operation, in the case of natural gas fired reciprocating engines using microprocessor combustion controls and low-cost exhaust catalyst technology developed for automobiles.


• | Rapid economic paybacks for equipment investments, as fast as four to six years when compared to existing utility costs and technologies.


• | Decreased sensitivity to fuel prices due to high overall efficiencies achieved with cogeneration of electricity and thermal energy, including the use of waste heat to operate absorption type air conditioning systems (displacing electric-powered cooling capacity at times of peak summer demand).


• | Reduced vulnerability of multiple de-centralized small-scale generating units compared to the risk of major outages from natural disasters or terrorist attacks against large central-station power plants and long distance transmission lines.


• | Ability to remotely monitor, control and dispatch energy services on a real-time basis using advanced switchgear, software, microprocessor and internet modalities. Through our on-site energy products and services, energy users are able to optimize, in real time, the mix of centralized and distributed electricity-generating resources.

The EPA has created a Combined Heat and Power Partnership to promote the benefits of DG systems. The Company is a member of this partnership. 
Our Business Strategy
We are a DG on-site energy company that generates revenue by selling energy in the form of electricity, heat, hot water, and air conditioning under long-term contracts with commercial, institutional and light industrial customers with a typical term of 10 to 15 years. We install our systems at no cost to our customers and retain ownership of the installed systems, although in some cases we also offer turnkey installations where customers may directly purchase our cogeneration systems. Our systems operate more efficiently than the utility grid, and we are able to sell the energy produced by these systems to our customers at prices below their existing cost of electricity (or air conditioning), heat, and hot water. Our cogeneration systems consist of natural gas-powered internal combustion engines that drive an electrical generator to produce 
7

AMERICAN DG ENERGY INC.

electricity and that capture the engine heat to produce space heating and hot water. Our energy systems also can be configured to drive a compressor that produces air conditioning and that also captures the engine heat. As of December 31, 2016, we had 92 energy systems operational.
To date, each of our installations runs in conjunction with the electric utility grid and requires standard interconnection approval from the local utility. Our customers use both our energy system and the electric utility grid for their electricity requirements. We typically supply the first 20% to 60% of a building's electricity requirements while the remaining electricity is supplied by the electric utility grid. Our customers are contractually bound to use the energy we supply.
To date, the price that we have charged our customers is set in our customer contracts at a discount to the price our customers would otherwise pay to their local electric utility. For the portion of the customer's electricity that we supply, the customer realizes immediate savings on his/her electric bill. In addition to electricity, we sell our customers the heat and hot water at the same price they were previously paying or at a discount equivalent to their discount from us on electricity. Our air conditioning systems are also priced at a discount.
We own and operate the DG systems; our customers have no investment in the units, and therefore our customers benefit from no capital requirements and no operating responsibilities. We manage the DG systems; our customers require no staff to manage the energy systems we provide, and, therefore, our customers have no energy system responsibilities. Our customers are bound, however, to pay for the energy supplied by the energy systems over the term of the agreement.
Energy and Products Portfolio
We provide a full range of CHP product and energy options. Our primary energy and products are listed below:

• | Energy Sales


◦ | Electricity


◦ | Thermal (Hot Water, Heat and Cooling)


• | Energy Producing Products


◦ | Cogeneration Packages


◦ | Chillers


◦ | Natural Gas Heat Pumps


◦ | Complementary Energy Equipment (e.g., boilers, etc.)


• | Turnkey Installation of Energy Producing Products with Incentives

Energy Sales
For the customers that want to own a CHP system, we offer a "turn-key" option whereby we provide equipment systems engineering, installation, interconnect approvals, on-site labor, and startup services needed to bring the complete CHP system on-line. Some customers contract with us to operate and manage the installed CHP systems. 

For customers seeking an alternative to our turn-key systems, we install, maintain, finance, own and operate complete on-site CHP systems that supply, on a long-term, contractual basis, electricity and other energy services. We sell the energy to customers at a guaranteed discount rate to the rates charged by conventional utility suppliers. 
Customers benefit from our On-Site Utility in a number of ways: 

• | Guaranteed lower price for energy


• | Only pay for the energy they use


• | No capital costs for equipment, engineering and installation


• | No equipment operating costs for fuel and maintenance


• | Immediate cash flow improvement


• | Significant green impact by the reduction of carbon produced


• | No staffing, operations and equipment responsibility

Customers are billed monthly and benefit from a reduction in their current energy bills without the capital costs and risks associated with owning and operating a cogeneration or chiller system. Also, by outsourcing the management and financing of on-site energy facilities to us, they can reap the economic advantages of DG without the need for retaining

AMERICAN DG ENERGY INC.

specialized in-house staff with skills unrelated to their core business. As part of our standard customer contract, we also agree to obtain any necessary permits or regulatory approvals at our sole expense. Our agreements are generally for a term of 15 years, renewable for two additional five-year terms upon the mutual agreement of the parties.
In regions where high electricity rates prevail, such as the Northeast, monthly payments for CHP energy services can yield attractive paybacks (e.g. in some cases as quickly as 3-5 years) on our investments in On-Site Utility projects. The price of natural gas has a minor effect on the financial returns obtained from our energy service contracts because we believe the value of hot water and other thermal services produced from the recovered heat generated by the internal combustion engine in our on-site DG system will generally increase or decrease faster, relative to higher or lower fuel costs. This recovered energy, which comprises up to 60% of the total heating value of fuel supplied to our CHP equipment, displaces some fuel use, but requires less than would otherwise be burned in a conventional boiler.
Energy Producing Products
Typically we offer our customers cogeneration units sized to produce 75 kW to 100 kW of electricity, water chillers sized to produce 200 to 400 tons of cooling and ultra-high-efficiency heating products, such as high efficiency water heaters. 
For cogeneration, we prefer a modular design approach that allows us to group multiple units together to serve customers with considerably larger power requirements. Often, cogeneration units are conveniently dispersed within a large operation, such as a hospital or campus, serving multiple-process heating systems that would otherwise be impractical to serve from a single large machine. The equipment we select often yields overall energy efficiencies in excess of 80% (from our equipment supplier's specifications). We also purchase energy equipment that incorporates mechanical work to extract heat from the environment, like high-efficiency water heaters, in order to supplement the chemical energy available in the fuel. The result is a significant boost in efficiency and reduced carbon emissions relative to conventional heating systems.
Service and Installation
Where appropriate, we utilize local vendors to install the equipment we deploy. We require long-term maintenance contracts and ongoing parts sales. Our centralized remote monitoring capability allows us to manage our equipment in the field. Our installations are performed by local contractors with experience in energy cogeneration systems.
Other Funding and Revenue Opportunities

Due to the availability of our energy systems, we are able to participate in the demand response market and, where permitted by customer contracts, receive payments. Demand response programs provide payments for either the reduction of electricity usage or the increase in electricity production during periods of peak usage throughout a utility territory. We have also received grants and incentives from state organizations and natural gas companies for our installed energy systems.
Sales and Marketing
Our On-Site Utility services are sold directly to end-users. We offer standardized packages of energy, equipment, and services suited to the needs of property owners and operators in healthcare, hospitality, large residential, athletic facilities, and certain industrial sites. This includes national accounts and other customer groups having a common set of energy requirements at multiple locations.
In 2015, as part of the initiative described below, we eliminated our in-house sales staff to focus on effectively investing capital in improvements aimed at increasing productivity of our existing portfolio. Accordingly, currently, we are not actively soliciting new customers for our On-Site Utility services or Turnkey solutions through sales or marketing staff although we may receive customer referrals from our equipment suppliers, including Tecogen and Ilios.
Competition
We compete with established utilities that provide electricity, wholesale electricity and gas utility distributors, companies that provide services similar to ours, and other forms of alternative energy. We believe DG is gaining acceptance in regions where energy customers are dissatisfied with the cost and reliability of traditional electricity service. These end-users, together with growing support from state legislatures and regulators, are creating a favorable climate for the growth of DG that is overcoming the objections of established utility providers. In our target markets, we compete with large utility companies such as Con Edison, Inc. and Long Island Power Authority in New York, Public Service Electric and Gas Company in New Jersey, and Eversource and National Grid USA Service Company, Inc. in Massachusetts. These companies

are much larger than us in terms of revenues, assets, marketing and other resources, but we target the same markets and customers. We compete with large utility companies by marketing our electricity services to the same potential commercial building customers. We compete on the basis of the cost, service, price, and favorable environmental benefits of generating energy with our installed systems. We also compete with other on-site utility companies, such as Aegis Energy Services Inc. and All Systems Cogeneration Inc.
Certain engine manufacturers sell DG units that range in size from a few kWs to many MWs in size. Most of the DG units are greater than 1 MW, and the manufacturers producing those units include Caterpillar Inc., Cummins Power Generation Inc., and Waukesha, a subsidiary of General Electric Company. In many cases, we view these companies as potential suppliers of equipment and not as competitors.
The alternative energy market continues to evolve. Many companies are developing alternative and renewable energy sources including solar power, wind power, fuel cells and micro-turbines. The effect of these developing technologies on our business is difficult to predict; however, when their technologies become more viable for our target markets, we may be able to adopt their technologies into our business model.
There are a number of energy service companies that offer services related to DG systems. These companies include Siemens AG, Honeywell International Inc. and Johnson Controls Inc. In general, these companies seek large, diverse projects for electricity demand reduction (e.g.,campuses) that include building lighting and controls, and electricity (on rare occasions) or cooling. Because of their overhead structures, these companies often solicit large projects rather than individual properties. Since we focus on smaller projects for energy supply, we believe we are suited to work in tandem with these companies when the opportunity arises.
There are local emerging cogeneration developers and contractors that are attempting to offer services similar to ours. To be successful, they would need to have the proper experience in equipment and technology, installation contracting, equipment maintenance and operation, economic site evaluation, project financing, and energy sales in addition to the capability of covering a broad region.
Relationship with Tecogen
Subsequent to year-end, on January 13, 2017, the Company sold certain items of equipment and a substantial portion of its parts inventory to Tecogen, which is a major supplier to the Company, at Tecogen's cost, which is generally manufactured or wholesale cost rather than a retail cost. The sale was prompted out of a need for funds to retire existing long-term indebtedness of the Company. As a result, the Company has classified these items as held for sale at December 31, 2016 at fair value (see Note 11 "Fair Value Measurements"). The Company's carrying value in respect of the items sold exceeded their fair value by approximately $744,000, which has been recognized in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.

As discussed above, on November 1, 2016, we entered into the Merger Agreement pursuant to which Tecogen has agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of ADGE in a stock-for-stock merger. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each share of ADGE common stock will be exchanged for 0.092 shares of Tecogen common stock, valuing ADGE at an approximately 27% premium to the Company's closing share price on that day. Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions including, among others, customary conditions relating to the approval of the Merger by the requisite vote of ADGE's stockholders and the stockholders of Tecogen; the receipt of all required regulatory approvals; the effectiveness of Tecogen’s registration statement on Form S-4 as amended, related to the Merger; and certain other customary closing conditions. Although there can be no assurance, and subject to the foregoing conditions, the Merger is expected to close in the first half of fiscal 2017. See Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” for a description of certain litigation arising from the proposed Merger transaction.
On August 7, 2015, the Company entered into a Facilities, Support Services and Business Agreement with Tecogen, or the Facilities Agreement. The Facilities Agreement replaced and amended version of the Facilities and Support Service Agreement, dated as of January 1, 2006 with Tecogen. The Facilities Agreement provides that, in exchange for agreed upon fees, Tecogen will provide the Company with, among other things; (1) certain office space; (2) certain business support services; (3) certain rights to purchase cogeneration products directly from Tecogen at a discounted price; (4) certain rights to purchase Tecogen services at a discounted price; (5) certain rights that allow the Company to purchase Tecogen products from Tecogen’s sales representatives; and (6) the right to certain royalty fees. Absent required notice, the Facilities Agreement will automatically renew for one-month periods. Under this agreement the Company leases approximately 2,400 square feet of office space from Tecogen. Under the terms of the Facilities Agreement the Company pays Tecogen a monthly fee of $4,479.

In October 2009, the Company entered into a five-year exclusive distribution agreement with Ilios Inc., or Ilios, a former subsidiary of Tecogen that subsequently merged with Tecogen, that develops and distributes ultra-high-efficiency heating products, such as a high efficiency water heater, that provides increased efficiency compared to conventional boilers. This distribution agreement was subsequently amended on November 12, 2013, as amended, the Distribution Agreement. The Distribution Agreement automatically renews for successive one year terms unless one party notifies the other in writing that it desires to terminate the agreement. Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, the Company has exclusive rights to incorporate Ilios's products in the Company's energy systems throughout the European Union and New England. The Company also has non-exclusive rights to distribute Ilios's products into the remaining parts of the United States and the world in cases where the Company retains ownership of the equipment for its On-Site Utility business. The Distribution Agreement allows Ilios to appoint sales representatives in the European Union, other than the Company.
Government Regulation
We are subject to extensive government regulation. We are required to file for local construction permits (electrical, mechanical and the like) and utility interconnects, and we must make various local and state filings related to environmental emissions. 
Compliance with Environmental Laws
In the past, many electric utility companies have raised opposition to DG, a critical element of our On-Site Utility business. Such resistance has generally taken the form of stringent standards for interconnection and the use of targeted rate structures as disincentives to combined generation of on-site power and heating or cooling services. A DG company's ability to obtain reliable and affordable back-up power through interconnection with the grid is essential to our business model. Utility policies and regulations in most states are often not prepared to accommodate widespread on-site generation. These barriers erected by electric utility companies and unfavorable regulations, where applicable, make more difficult or uneconomic our ability to connect to the electric grid at customer sites and are an impediment to the growth of our business. The development of our business could be adversely affected by any slowdown or reversal in the utility deregulation process or by difficulties in negotiating backup power supply agreements with electric providers in the areas where we intend to do business.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, the Company employed twelve active full-time employees and three part-time employees. We believe that our relationship with our employees is satisfactory. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. As part of the Initiative, and in order to benefit from reduced payroll costs and expenses, we determined to predominantly eliminate our direct sales department and rely upon referrals related to additional sales of our equipment and services to new customers, including referrals from Tecogen.
Strategic Initiative
Late in 2015, the Company began executing an initiative to more effectively invest its capital, or the Initiative. The Initiative is focused on effectively investing the Company’s capital by increasing the performance of its existing sites. The goal of the Initiative is to make strategic capital improvements aimed at increasing productivity of the existing portfolio while optimizing the Company’s margins and increasing cash flow. The Company expects that the Initiative will provide a strong foundation of high performing assets to be used to fund future growth. 
The Initiative comprises a number of phases and contains multiple layers of evaluation. The first step was analyzing the existing portfolio to determine which sites make feasible options for investment. The Company compared each site’s unique income factors to its current operational performance to determine not only each site’s viability but also its order of priority. The Company evaluated certain indicators, including the size of the existing site, highly profitable utility rate matrices, and unique economic opportunities, including demand management programs or carbon credit rebates. The Company believes that upgrading existing sites is a more effective use of the Company’s capital than building new sites because in general it takes at least four years for a new site to experience a positive return on investment, while improvements to existing sites can boost the return on already profitable sites and result in rapid positive returns on investment for sites that have not yet become profitable. 
After identifying viable sites, the Company determined the appropriate improvements to be conducted at such viable sites. This process, managed by the Company’s operations and engineering staff, included evaluating the existing energy installation for points of deficiency and evaluating the site location for opportunities for new points of delivery. These

evaluations were driven through the careful analysis of the Company’s vast catalog of historic operational energy data, which grows at a rate of approximately two million new data points per day. By utilizing the catalog, the Company’s staff can make data-driven decisions. Once the improvements have been made and the existing sites have been optimized it is more self-sufficient, driving down ongoing maintenance and equipment related expenses and improving the site’s energy revenue profile.
This final phase in the Initiative is focused on improved customer relations and higher customer satisfaction. The Company is elevating its relationship with its’ customers from a passive utility provider to an active energy partner. This means not only delivering consistent, reliable energy to the customer at our discounted rate, but also promptly resolving any issues and assisting customers with other issues if and when the opportunity arises. The Company believes that by taking this approach it will produce more inside sales leads. Many of the Company’s customers own multiple buildings or are part of organizations that manage many properties that can benefit from On-Site Utility CHP technology, making them prime candidates for inside sales. Low interest rates are currently an additional hurdle to outside sales by making outright customer purchase of equipment easier and potentially more attractive than our On-Site Utility solutions. 
In conjunction with the Initiative, the Company is making broader improvements to all of its portfolios, including: (1) upgrading monitoring to 4G to reduce communications-based downtime and allow for instant, real-time monitoring of sites; (2) introducing water treatment to the water that flows through our equipment to improve the lifespan of our equipment and decrease operating costs; and (3) adding and improving equipment focused on generating demand revenue. These smaller steps across the fleet have already and will continue to increase revenues and reduce costs.
To support the Initiative, the Company diverted resources from some other departments; primarily the sales and marketing departments. This results in a decrease in selling expenses and general administrative expenses. The Company believes these are the best departments and expenses to reduce as improvement of the installed base has the ability to lead to higher customer satisfaction and possibly customer referrals. The Company believes that focusing on fixing existing sites is a better use of resources then incurring these high sales cost to find new suitable customers. This may change if interest rates rise and it becomes less cost effective for potential customers to finance their own equipment purchase.
Restructuring of American DG New York, LLC Joint Venture
On June 5, 2015, American DG New York, LLC, or ADGNY, a joint venture in which the Company holds a 51% membership interest, distributed certain energy systems related to sites it owned and operated to each of its members, the Company and AES-NJ Cogen Co., Inc., or AES, in exchange for (i) with respect to 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock and (ii) with respect to AES, $100,000. Prior to the distribution, ADGNY owned and operated cogeneration units at 21 sites, and each member shared proportionally in the revenue generated by each site. In accordance with the terms of the distribution, all of ADGNY's assets related to eight sites were distributed to the Company, all of ADGNY's assets related to eight sites were distributed to AES, and all of the assets related to the remaining five sites remain held by ADGNY. The assets distributed related to each site, consisted primarily of cogeneration units and long term operating agreements. Prior to the distribution, each member held a certain percentage interest in the assets related to each site; following the distribution, however, each member holds complete direct ownership of the assets such member received in the distribution. 
The direct and whole ownership of the assets, received by each party in the distribution, related to the respective sites will allow each party to independently manage and operate such assets. Prior to the distribution, AES operated the assets related to these sites under an operating agreement. Following the distribution, the Company will manage the remaining sites in ADGNY.
This relocation of ownership of these units was done to: (1) increase the overall number of units the Company owns; (2) give the Company the ability to increase the performance of the sites it acquired and the sites remaining in ADGNY; (3) have stronger relationships with the customers that obtain energy from the units acquired; and (4) improve logistics. Eight sites consisting of 13 units were distributed to the Company, while eight sites consisting of nine units were distributed to AES. In addition, these acquired units have great potential for improvement. The Company believes that assuming control of more sites, including the ability to maintain five sites remaining in ADGNY, will give the Company increased flexibility to improve the performance of each site. This in turn has the potential to increase revenue. In the short term, this restructuring resulted in a loss of revenue for the Company because: (1) in the distribution eight sites were distributed to AES that the Company previously majority owned and received considerable revenue from; and (2) the Company has not had sufficient time to offset this revenue loss by substantially improving the performance of the eight sites distributed to it or by substantially improving the performance of the five sites remaining in ADGNY that the Company now maintains.
