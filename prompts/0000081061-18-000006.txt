Item 1. Business
Publix Super Markets, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the Company) are in the business of operating retail food supermarkets in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia. The Company was founded in 1930 and later merged into another corporation that was originally incorporated in 1921. The Company has no other significant lines of business or industry segments.
Merchandising and manufacturing
The Company sells grocery (including dairy, produce, deli, bakery, meat and seafood), health and beauty care, general merchandise, pharmacy, floral and other products and services. The percentage of consolidated sales by merchandise category for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:

 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
Grocery | 84 | % | | 84 | % | 85 | %
Other | 16 | % | | 16 | % | 15 | %
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

The Company’s lines of merchandise include a variety of nationally advertised and private label brands as well as unbranded products such as produce, meat and seafood. The Company receives the food and nonfood products it distributes from many sources. These products are delivered to the supermarkets through Company distribution centers or directly from the suppliers and are generally available in sufficient quantities to enable the Company to adequately satisfy its customers. The Company believes that its sources of supply of these products and raw materials used in manufacturing are adequate for its needs and that it is not dependent upon a single supplier or relatively few suppliers. Approximately 77% of the total cost of products purchased is delivered to the supermarkets through the Company’s distribution centers. Private label items are produced in the Company’s dairy, bakery and deli manufacturing facilities or are manufactured for the Company by suppliers. The Company has experienced no significant changes in the kinds of products sold or in its methods of distribution since the beginning of the fiscal year.
Store operations
The Company operated 1,167 supermarkets at the end of 2017, compared with 1,136 at the beginning of the year. In 2017, 44 supermarkets were opened (including nine replacement supermarkets) and 132 supermarkets were remodeled. Thirteen supermarkets were closed during the period. The nine replacement supermarkets that opened in 2017 replaced five of the supermarkets closed in 2017 and four supermarkets closed in 2016. The eight remaining supermarkets closed in 2017 will be replaced on site in subsequent periods. New supermarkets added 1.5 million square feet in 2017, an increase of 2.9%. At the end of 2017, the Company had 779 supermarkets located in Florida, 186 in Georgia, 65 in Alabama, 58 in South Carolina, 41 in Tennessee, 30 in North Carolina and eight in Virginia. Also, at the end of 2017, the Company had 15 supermarkets under construction in Florida, nine in North Carolina, four in Alabama, two in Georgia, two in Tennessee and two in Virginia.
Competition
The Company is engaged in the highly competitive retail food industry. The Company’s competitors include traditional supermarkets, such as national and regional supermarket chains and independent supermarkets, as well as nontraditional competitors, such as supercenters, membership warehouse clubs, mass merchandisers, dollar stores, drug stores, specialty food stores, restaurants, convenience stores and online retailers. The Company’s ability to attract and retain customers is based primarily on quality of goods and service, price, convenience, product mix and store location.  
Working capital
The Company’s working capital at the end of 2017 consisted of $4,084.9 million in current assets and $3,142.3 million in current liabilities. Normal operating fluctuations in these balances can result in changes to cash flows from operating activities presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows that are not necessarily indicative of long-term operating trends. There are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items.
Seasonality
The historical influx of winter residents to Florida and increased purchases of products during the traditional Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter holidays typically result in seasonal sales increases from November to April of each year.

Numerous trademarks, including “Publix” and “Where Shopping is a Pleasure,” have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
