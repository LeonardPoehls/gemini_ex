Item 1. Business
General
 
Entegra Financial Corp. (“Entegra” or the “Company”), headquartered in Franklin, North Carolina, was incorporated on May 31, 2011 to be the holding company for Entegra Bank (the “Bank”). On September 30, 2014, the mutual to stock conversion was completed and the Bank became the wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Also on that date, the Company sold and issued 6,546,375 shares of its common stock at a price of $10.00 per share, through which the Company received net offering proceeds of $63.7 million.
 
The Company has one non-bank subsidiary, Macon Capital Trust I (“Macon Trust”), a Delaware statutory trust, formed to facilitate the issuance of trust preferred securities. Macon Trust is not consolidated in the Company’s financial statements.
 
Entegra Bank is a North Carolina chartered savings bank founded in 1922. Our business consists primarily of accepting deposits from individuals and small businesses and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, primarily in loans secured by real estate, including commercial real estate loans, one-to-four family residential loans, construction loans, and home equity loans and lines of credit. We also originate commercial business loans and invest in investment securities. Through our mortgage loan production operations we originate loans for sale in the secondary markets to Fannie Mae and others, generally retaining the servicing rights in order to generate servicing income, supplement our core deposits with escrow deposits and maintain relationships with local borrowers. We offer a variety of deposit accounts, including savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, commercial and regular checking accounts, and individual retirement accounts.
 
The Bank has one wholly-owned subsidiary, Entegra Services, Inc., which was formerly used to operate an investment real estate property acquired in settlement of loans. The property was sold during 2015 and the subsidiary was inactive as of December 31, 2016.
 
Market Area
 
The Bank was organized as a mutual savings and loan association, or “thrift,” for the primary purpose of promoting home ownership through mortgage lending, financed by locally gathered deposits. Surviving the Great Depression of the 1930’s, we remained a single-office bank until we opened a second office in downtown Murphy, North Carolina in 1981. Between 1993 and 2002, we added eight more branches in North Carolina, including a second office in Franklin, one in each of Highlands, Brevard, Sylva, Cashiers and Arden, and two in Hendersonville. In 2007, we opened two more branches in Columbus and Saluda, North Carolina. During 2015, we opened a branch in Greenville, South Carolina and acquired two branches in Anderson and Chesnee, South Carolina. In 2016, we acquired a branch and a loan production office in Waynesville and Asheville, North Carolina, respectively and opened a loan production office in Clemson, South Carolina. In February 2017, we acquired two branches in Jasper, Georgia.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 15 branches and two loan production offices located throughout the western North Carolina counties of Cherokee, Haywood, Henderson, Jackson, Macon, Polk and Transylvania and the Upstate South Carolina counties of Anderson, Greenville, Pickens, and Spartanburg, which we consider our primary market area. We also regularly extend loans to customers located in neighboring counties, including Buncombe, Clay, Rutherford and Swain in North Carolina; Fannin, Rabun, Towns and Union in Georgia; and Cherokee and Oconee, in South Carolina, which we consider our secondary market area.
 
The primary economic drivers of our primary market area in North Carolina are tourism and a vacation and retirement home industry. This area has numerous small- to mid-sized businesses, which are our primary business customers. These businesses include agricultural producers, artisans and specialty craft manufacturers, small industrial manufacturers, and a variety of service oriented industries. The largest employers in Macon County include Drake Software, a national tax software provider, based in Franklin.

Our primary market area in South Carolina is economically diverse with major industries including the automobile industry, health and pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, and academic institutions. Located adjacent to major transportation corridors such as Interstates 85 and 26 and centrally located between Charlotte, North Carolina and Atlanta, Georgia, the Upstate South Carolina market is consistently recognized nationally as an area for business growth and relocation.
 
Unemployment data is one of the most significant indicators of the economic health in our market areas and is monitored by management on a regular basis. As reflected in the table below, the unemployment rate in each of the counties in our primary market area was elevated subsequent to the Great Recession, but have significantly improved since 2013.

Competition
 
The banking business is highly competitive. We have significant competition in our primary and secondary market areas. We compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, finance companies, credit unions and other financial services companies. Many of our larger commercial bank competitors have greater name recognition and offer certain services that we do not. However, we believe that our long-time presence in our primary market area and focus on superior service distinguish us from our competitors, many of whom operate under different names or are under different leadership as a consequence of the effects of the recent recession and a series of mergers and acquisitions.
Market Share
 
As of June 30, 2016, the most recent date for which market data is available, total deposits in the Bank’s North Carolina primary market area, Cherokee, Haywood, Henderson, Jackson, Macon, Polk and Transylvania counties, were over $5.3 billion. At June 30, 2016, our deposits represented 14.6% of the market ranking us second in deposit market share within our North Carolina primary market area.
 
As of June 30, 2016, total deposits in the Bank’s South Carolina primary market area, Anderson, Greenville, and Spartanburg counties, were over $18.1 billion. We acquired two branches in Anderson and Spartanburg counties from another financial institution during December 2015. In addition, we opened a full service branch in Greenville County during the fourth quarter of 2015. As of June 30, 2016, our $53.7 million of deposits held at South Carolina branches represented less than 1.0% of total deposits in this market.

Employees
 
At December 31, 2016, we had a total of 245 employees, of which 228 were full-time and 17 were part-time, all of whom were compensated by the Bank. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit, and we have not recently experienced any type of strike or labor dispute. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Lending Activities
 
Our primary lending activities are the origination of commercial real estate loans, one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, other construction and land loans, commercial business loans and home equity loans and lines of credit. Our largest category of loans is commercial real estate followed by one-to-four family, and other construction and land loans. At December 31, 2016, our top 25 relationships represented a lending exposure of $132.2 million with the largest single relationship totaling $9.3 million. These loans are primarily for commercial business purposes and collateralized by real estate, primarily commercial, and construction and land development loans.
 
Commercial Real Estate Loans. At December 31, 2016, $292.9 million, or 39.2% of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans. Properties securing our commercial real estate loans primarily comprise business owner-occupied properties, small office buildings and office suites, and income-producing real estate.
 
In the underwriting of commercial real estate loans, we generally lend up to the lesser of 80% of the appraised value or purchase price of the property. We base our decision to lend primarily on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower. In evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan, we emphasize the ratio of the property’s projected net cash flow to the loan’s debt service requirement (generally requiring a preferred ratio of 1.25x), computed after deduction for an appropriate vacancy factor and reasonable expenses. Individuals owning 20% or more of the business and/or real estate are generally required to sign the note as co-borrowers or provide personal guarantees. We require title insurance, fire and extended coverage casualty insurance, and, if appropriate, flood insurance, in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property. Almost all of our commercial real estate loans are generated internally by our loan officers.
 
One-to–Four Family Residential Mortgage Loans. At December 31, 2016, $278.4 million, or 37.3% of our loan portfolio consisted of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. We offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans with maturities generally up to 30 years. We generally sell 30-year fixed rate loans in the secondary market.
 
Our one-to-four family residential mortgage loans originated for sale are underwritten according to Fannie Mae underwriting guidelines. We refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.” We originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which increased from $417,000 in 2016 to $424,000 in 2017 for single-family homes. Loans in excess of the maximum conforming loan limit (referred to as “jumbo loans”) may be originated for retention in our loan portfolio. We generally underwrite jumbo loans in the same manner as conforming loans.
 
We originate loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80% for sale into the secondary market. We require private mortgage insurance for loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80%.
 
We generally retain the servicing rights on loans sold in the secondary market in order to generate cash flow, supplement our core deposits with escrow deposits, and maintain relationships with local borrowers.
 
Other than loans for the construction of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans (described under “—One-to Four-Family Residential Construction, Other Construction and Land, and Consumer Loans”) and home equity loans and lines of credit (described under “—Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit”), presently we do not offer “interest only” mortgage loans (where the borrower pays only interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan) on one-to-four family residential properties.

-

We do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower may pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan.
 
Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. At December 31, 2016, $50.3 million, or 6.7% of our loan portfolio, consisted of home equity loans and lines of credit. In addition to traditional one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, we offer home equity loans and lines of credit that are secured by the borrower’s primary or secondary residence. Our home equity loans and lines of credit are currently originated with fixed or adjustable rates of interest. Home equity loans and lines of credit are generally underwritten with the same criteria that we use to underwrite one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. For a borrower’s primary residence, home equity loans and lines of credit may be underwritten with a loan-to-value ratio of 80% when combined with the principal balance of the existing mortgage loan, while the maximum loan-to-value ratio on secondary residences is 70% when combined with the principal balance of the existing mortgage loan. We require appraisals or internally prepared real estate evaluations on home equity loans and lines of credit. At the time we close a home equity loan or line of credit, we record a deed of trust to perfect our security interest in the underlying collateral.
 
Commercial Loans. At December 31, 2016, $41.3 million, or 5.5% of our loan portfolio, consisted of commercial loans. We make various types of secured and unsecured commercial loans to customers in our market areas in order to provide customers with working capital and for other general business purposes. The terms of these loans generally range from less than one year to a maximum of 10 years. These loans bear either a fixed interest rate or an interest rate linked to a variable market index. We seek to originate loans to small- to medium-sized businesses with principal balances between $150,000 and $750,000; however, we also originate government-guaranteed Small Business Administration, or SBA, loans with higher balances with the intent of selling the guaranteed portion into the secondary market. We also purchase the guaranteed portion of SBA loans in the secondary market to supplement our commercial loan originations.
 
Commercial credit decisions are based upon our credit assessment of each applicant. We evaluate the applicant’s ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms of the loan and assess the risks involved. Individuals owning 20% or more of the business and/or real estate are generally required to sign the note as co-borrowers or provide personal guarantees. In addition to evaluating the applicant’s financial statements, we consider the adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment for the loan. Credit agency reports of the applicant’s personal credit history supplement our analysis of the applicant’s creditworthiness. In addition, collateral supporting a secured transaction is analyzed to determine its marketability. Commercial business loans generally have higher interest rates than residential loans of similar duration because they have a higher risk of default with repayment generally depending on the successful operation of the borrower’s business and the sufficiency of any collateral.
 
One-to-Four Family Residential Construction, Other Construction and Land, and Consumer Loans. At December 31, 2016, $18.5 million, or 2.5% of our loan portfolio consisted of one-to-four family residential construction loans. Other construction and land loans comprised $60.6 million, or 8.1% of our loan portfolio. Consumer loans totaled $4.6 million, or 0.7% of our loan portfolio, and included automobile and other consumer loans. We make construction loans to owner-occupiers of residential properties, and to businesses for commercial properties. In the past, we made loans to developers for speculative residential construction; however, following the recession we have limited our speculative construction lending. Advances on construction loans are made in accordance with a schedule reflecting the cost of construction, but are generally limited to an 80% loan-to-value ratio based on the appraised value upon completion. Repayment of construction loans on non-residential properties is normally attributable to rental income, income from the borrower’s operating entity or the sale of the property. Repayment of loans on income-producing property is normally scheduled following completion of construction, when permanent financing is obtained. We typically provide permanent mortgage financing on our construction loans for income-producing property. Construction loans are interest-only during the construction period, which typically does not exceed 12 months, and convert to permanent, fully-amortizing financing following the completion of construction.
 
Generally, before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by a state-certified or state-licensed appraiser. We review and inspect properties before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan.

At December 31, 2016, our largest other construction and land loan had a principal balance of $5.2 million and was secured by a first mortgage on single family residential real estate, as well as additional residential building lots. At December 31, 2016, this loan was performing in accordance with its terms.
 
Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales, Participations and Servicing. All residential loans that we originate are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures, which incorporate standard Fannie Mae underwriting guidelines, as applicable. We originate both adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans. Our loan origination and sales activity may be adversely affected by a rising interest rate environment that typically results in decreased loan demand. Most of our one-to-four family residential mortgage loans are originated by our loan officers.
 
Historically, we have sold most of our 15-year and longer residential loans to Fannie Mae or non-government purchasers. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we sold $34.5 million, $29.0 million, and $20.9 million, respectively, of conforming residential loans, primarily with terms of 15 years and longer. We sell our loans with the servicing rights retained on residential mortgage loans, and have no immediate plans to change this practice.
 
At December 31, 2016, we were servicing residential loans owned by third parties with an aggregate principal balance of $235.2 million. Loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments, accounting for principal and interest, contacting delinquent borrowers, supervising foreclosures, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans. We retain a portion of the interest paid by the borrower on the loans we service as consideration for performing these servicing activities.
 
At December 31, 2016, we were servicing SBA loans having a gross loan amount of $26.4 million, of which the unguaranteed portion of $6.6 million has been retained by us and the guaranteed portion of $19.8 million has been sold in the secondary market.
 
At December 31, 2016, we were servicing commercial loan participations having a gross loan amount of $18.7 million, of which $16.0 million was retained by us and $2.7 million was owned by our co-participants.
 
From time to time, we have participated in loans originated by other financial institutions that service and remit payments to us. At December 31, 2016, the unpaid balance of these loans was $20.6 million.
 
Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the board of directors of the Bank (“Bank Board”). The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan and value of the collateral that will secure the loan. To assess the borrower’s ability to repay, we review the borrower’s employment and credit history and information on the historical and projected income and expenses of the borrower.
 
Our policies and loan approval limits are established by the Bank Board. Loans in amounts up to individual loan authority limits set annually by management and the Bank Board can be approved by designated individual officers or officers acting together pursuant to our loan policy. Relationships in excess of these amounts require the approval of the Officers Loan Committee, Executive Loan Committee, or Directors Loan Committee within the authority limits set by the Bank Board. The Bank Board may approve loans up to the internal loans-to-one-borrower policy limit of $10.0 million, which is below the Bank’s regulatory loans-to-one-borrower limit of $22.2 million as of December 31, 2016.
 
We require appraisals or internally prepared evaluations of all real property securing one-to-four family residential and commercial real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit. All appraisers are state-licensed or state-certified, and our practice is to have local appraisers approved on an annual basis by the Bank Board. Internal evaluations are prepared only by individuals possessing the necessary skill and experience to meet regulatory competency requirements. Evaluations are reviewed by staff who report directly to the Chief Risk Officer to ensure independence from the loan production process.

Investments
 
The Bank’s Asset/Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) is primarily responsible, subject to the ultimate approval of the Bank Board, for implementing our investment policy. The general investment strategies are developed and authorized by the ALCO Committee in consultation with the Bank Board. The ALCO Committee is responsible for the execution of specific investment actions by our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer or Chief Executive Officer, for all sales, purchases, or trades executed in the investment portfolio. All our investment transactions are periodically reported to the ALCO Committee and the Bank Board. The investment policy is reviewed annually by the ALCO Committee, and any changes to the policy are subject to approval by the full Bank Board. The overall objectives of our investment policy are to maintain a portfolio of high quality and diversified investments to maximize interest income over the long term and to minimize risk, to provide collateral for borrowings, to provide additional earnings when loan production is low, and, when appropriate, to reduce our tax liability. The policy dictates that investment decisions give consideration to the safety of principal, liquidity requirements and interest rate risk management.
 
Our current investment policy permits investments that meet certain quality guidelines in direct U.S. Government obligations and securities, U.S. Government agencies, municipal securities, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate issues, certain commercial paper, agency structured notes, trust preferred securities, subordinated debt, and bank owned life insurance. We only hold securities classified as “trading” in a Rabbi Trust established to generate returns that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to market risk of certain deferred compensation agreements. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 802-10-35-01 investment securities “available-for-sale” are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and investment securities “held-to-maturity” are held at amortized cost. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices of like or similar securities, if available, and these securities are classified as Level 1 or Level 2. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security’s credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions and are classified as Level 3.
 
We purchase mortgage-backed securities insured or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or the Government National Mortgage Association. We invest in quality securities to obtain yields higher than we can receive from holding in overnight cash or other short term cash accounts, and to meet our Asset/Liability objectives which focus on liquidity and interest rate risk in our portfolio as a whole.
 
Sources of Funds 
 
General. Deposits traditionally have been our primary source of funds for our investment and lending activities. Our primary outside borrowing source is the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (“FHLB” or “FHLB of Atlanta”). We have in the past used both brokered deposits and internet generated deposits to fund loan growth and to manage interest rate risk. Our additional sources of funds are scheduled loan payments, maturing investments, loan repayments, security repurchase agreements, retained earnings, income on other earning assets and the proceeds of loan sales.
 
Deposits. We accept deposits primarily from within our primary market area. As noted, we have also used brokered and internet deposits as a source of funds. We rely on our competitive pricing and products, convenient locations and quality customer service to attract and retain deposits. Our branch network is well established in our primary market area. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. Our deposit accounts consist of savings accounts, certificates of deposit, regular checking accounts, money market accounts and individual retirement accounts.
 
Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are revised on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market interest rates, liquidity requirements and our deposit growth goals.
 
Borrowings. Our borrowings consist of advances from the FHLB of Atlanta. At December 31, 2016, FHLB advances totaled $298.5 million, or 25.7% of total liabilities. At December 31, 2016, we had unused borrowing capacity with the FHLB of $13.9 million based on collateral pledged at that date. We had total additional credit availability with FHLB of $56.8 million as of December 31, 2016 if additional collateral was pledged. Advances from the FHLB of Atlanta are secured by our investment in the common stock of the FHLB of Atlanta, securities in our investment portfolio, and approved loans in our one-to-four family residential and commercial loan portfolios.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 
Bank holding companies and state savings banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. Set forth below is a brief description of certain regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to us. The description below is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on us. Supervision, regulation and examination by the bank regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors rather than shareholders of banks and bank holding companies. Statutes and regulations which contain wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationship of financial institutions are introduced regularly. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any proposed statute or regulation will be adopted or the extent to which our business or the business of the Bank may be affected by such statute or regulation.
Holding Company Regulation 
 
General. As a bank holding company, Entegra is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHCA”), and subject to certain regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). Under the BHCA, a bank holding company such as Entegra, which does not qualify as a financial holding company, is prohibited from engaging in activities other than banking, managing or controlling banks or other permissible subsidiaries, furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries or engaging in any other activity that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.
 
The BHCA prohibits Entegra from acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings bank, or merging or consolidating with another bank holding company without prior approval of the Federal Reserve. Additionally, the BHCA prohibits Entegra from engaging in, or acquiring ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any company engaged in, a non-banking business unless such business is determined by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking as to be properly incident thereto. The BHCA does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of such non-banking related activities.
 
State and federal law restricts the amount of voting stock of a savings bank or bank holding company that a person may acquire without prior regulatory approval. Pursuant to North Carolina law, no person may directly or indirectly purchase or acquire voting stock of any savings bank or bank holding company which would result in the change in control of that savings bank or bank holding company unless the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks (“Commissioner”) approves the proposed acquisition. Under North Carolina law, a person will be deemed to have acquired “control” of a savings bank or bank holding company if the person directly or indirectly (i) owns, controls or has power to vote 10% or more of the voting stock of the savings bank or bank holding company, or (ii) otherwise possesses the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policy of the savings bank or bank holding company. As a result of Entegra’s ownership of the Bank, Entegra is also registered under the bank holding company laws of North Carolina, and as such is subject to the regulation and supervision of the Commissioner.
 
Federal law imposes additional restrictions on acquisitions of stock of banks and bank holding companies. Under the BHCA, and the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978 (the “CBCA”), as amended, and regulations adopted thereunder and under the BHCA, a person or group acting in concert must give advance notice to the applicable banking regulator before directly or indirectly acquiring “control” of a federally-insured bank or bank holding company. Under applicable federal law, control is conclusively deemed to have been acquired upon the acquisition of 25% or more of any class of voting securities of any federally-insured bank or bank holding company. Both the BHCA and CBCA generally create a rebuttable presumption of a change in control if a person or group acquires ownership or control of or the power to vote 10% or more of any class of a bank or bank holding company’s voting securities, and either (i) the bank or bank holding company has a class of outstanding securities that are subject to registration under the Exchange Act, or (ii) no other person will own, control, or have the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction. This presumption can, in certain cases, be rebutted by entering into “passivity commitments” with the Federal Reserve or Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as applicable. Upon receipt of a notice of a change in control, the FDIC or the Federal Reserve, as applicable, may approve or disapprove the acquisition.

-

Prior approval of the Federal Reserve and the Commissioner would be required for any acquisition of control of either Entegra or the Bank by any bank holding company under the BHCA and the North Carolina Bank Holding Company Act (“NCBHCA”), respectively. Control for purposes of the BHCA and the NCBHCA would be based on whether the holding company (i) owns, controls or has power to vote 25% or more of our voting stock or the voting stock of the Bank, (ii) controls the election of a majority of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) or the Bank Board, or (iii) the Federal Reserve or the Commissioner, as applicable, determines that the holding company directly or indirectly exercises a controlling influence over our management or policies or the management or policies of the Bank. As part of such acquisition, the holding company (unless already so registered) would be required to register as a bank holding company under the BHCA and the NCBHCA.
 
There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries by law and regulatory policy that are designed to minimize potential loss to the depositors of such depository institutions and the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund in the event the depository institution becomes in danger of default or is in default. For example, to avoid receivership of an insured depository institution subsidiary, a bank holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any insured depository institution subsidiary that has become “undercapitalized” with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal banking agency up to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5% of the institution’s total assets at the time the institution became undercapitalized, or (ii) the amount which is necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all acceptable capital standards as of the time the institution initially fails to comply with such capital restoration plan. Under a policy of the Federal Reserve with respect to bank holding company operations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy. The Federal Reserve under the BHCA also has the authority to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or to relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary (other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank) upon the Federal Reserve’s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.
 
In addition, the “cross-guarantee” provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, require insured depository institutions under common control to reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered as a result of the default of a commonly controlled insured depository institution or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled insured depository institution in danger of default. The FDIC may decline to enforce the cross-guarantee provisions if it determines that a waiver is in the best interest of the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund. The FDIC’s claim for damages is superior to claims of shareholders of the insured depository institution or any affiliate but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured depository institutions.
 
Capital Adequacy Guidelines for Holding Companies. The Federal Reserve has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies and banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System and have consolidated assets of $500 million or more. Bank holding companies subject to the Federal Reserve’s capital adequacy guidelines are required to comply with the Federal Reserve’s risk-based capital guidelines. Under these regulations, the minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet activities, such as standby letters of credit) is 8.0%. At least half of the total capital is required to be “tier 1 capital,” principally consisting of common shareholders’ equity, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets. The remainder (“tier 2 capital”) may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt, certain hybrid capital instruments and other debt securities, perpetual preferred stock, and a limited amount of the general loan loss allowance.
 
In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the Federal Reserve has adopted a minimum tier 1 capital (leverage) ratio, under which a bank holding company must maintain a minimum level of tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets of at least 3% in the case of a bank holding company which has the highest regulatory examination rating and is not contemplating significant growth or expansion. All other bank holding companies are expected to maintain a tier 1 capital (leverage) ratio of at least 4%.

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve approved a new rule that implements the “Basel III” regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule includes new risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective January 1, 2015, and revise the definition of what constitutes “capital” for purposes of calculating those ratios. See “—Net Worth and Capital Adequacy Requirements Applicable to the Bank” below.
 
The Company exceeded all applicable minimum capital adequacy guidelines as of December 31, 2016.
 
Dividend and Repurchase Limitations. The Federal Reserve has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, and which expresses the Federal Reserve’s view that a holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, the Federal Reserve may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company’s bank subsidiary is classified as “undercapitalized.”
 
Federal Reserve policy also provides that a holding company should inform the Federal Reserve supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred.
 
Pursuant to Federal Reserve regulations, the Company may not make a distribution that would constitute a return of capital during the three years following the completion of the conversion and offering.
 
The Company’s ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares may also be dependent upon its receipt of dividends from the Bank. The Company’s payment of dividends and repurchase of stock will also be subject to the requirements and limitations of North Carolina corporate law.
 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed bank regulation and has affected the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) with extensive powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB also has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, such as the Bank, will continue to be examined by their applicable federal bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also gave state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC assessments for deposit insurance, permanently increasing the maximum amount of deposit insurance to $250,000 per depositor. The legislation also, among other things, requires originators of certain securitized loans to retain a portion of the credit risk, stipulates regulatory rate-setting for certain debit card interchange fees, repealed restrictions on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposits and contains a number of reforms related to mortgage originations. The Dodd-Frank Act increased the ability of shareholders to influence boards of directors by requiring companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments. However, as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), we are exempt from the shareholder vote requirement until one year after we cease to be an “emerging growth company.” The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. We will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes in law and any new regulations promulgated.

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, enacted in 1999 (the “GLB Act”), dramatically changed various federal laws governing the banking, securities and insurance industries. The GLB Act expanded opportunities for banks and bank holding companies to provide services and engage in other revenue-generating activities that previously were prohibited to them. In doing so, it increased competition in the financial services industry, presenting greater opportunities for our larger competitors who were more able to expand their services and products than smaller, community-oriented financial institutions.
 
USA Patriot Act of 2001. The USA Patriot Act of 2001 was enacted in response to the terrorist attacks that occurred in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001. The Act was intended to strengthen the ability of U.S. law enforcement and the intelligence community to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. The impact of the Act on financial institutions of all kinds has been significant and wide ranging. The Act, which was largely extended in 2015 by the USA Freedom Act, contains sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and requires various regulations, including standards for verifying customer identification at account opening, and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering.
 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the SEC under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of our Board about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting.
 
Federal Securities Laws. The Company filed with the SEC a registration statement under the Securities Act for the registration of the shares of common stock that were issued pursuant to the offering. Upon completion of the offering, the common stock was registered with the SEC under the Exchange Act. The Company is now subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Exchange Act.
 
The registration under the Securities Act of shares of common stock does not cover the resale of those shares. Shares of common stock purchased by persons who are not the Company’s affiliates may be resold without registration. Shares purchased by the Company’s affiliates are subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. If the Company meets the current public information requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, each affiliate that complies with the other conditions of Rule 144, including those that require the affiliate’s sale to be aggregated with those of other persons, would be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a number of shares not to exceed, in any three-month period, the greater of 1% of our outstanding shares, or the average weekly volume of trading in the shares during the preceding four calendar weeks. In the future, the Company may permit affiliates to have their shares registered for sale under the Securities Act.
 
Emerging Growth Company Status. On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act made numerous changes to the federal securities laws to facilitate access to capital markets. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.0 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an “emerging growth company.” We qualify as an “emerging growth company” and believe that we will continue to qualify as an “emerging growth company” for five years from the completion of our stock offering.
 
As an “emerging growth company,” we have elected to use the transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements were made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. As of December 31, 2016, there is not a significant difference in the presentation of our financial statements as compared to other public companies as a result of this transition guidance.

Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an “emerging growth company,” we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Act, (iii) hold non-binding shareholder votes regarding annual executive compensation or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger or similar corporate transaction, (iv) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (v) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer’s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our initial public offering or until we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” whichever is earlier.
 
We could remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.
 
Bank Regulation 
 
General. The Bank is a North Carolina chartered savings bank. Its deposits are insured through the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund, and it is subject to supervision and examination by and the regulations and reporting requirements of the Commissioner and the FDIC.
 
Subject to limitations established by the Commissioner, North Carolina chartered savings banks may make any loan or investment or engage in any activity that is permitted to federally-chartered institutions. In addition to such lending authority, North Carolina chartered savings banks are authorized to invest funds, in excess of loan demand, in certain statutorily permitted investments, including but not limited to (i) obligations of the U.S. Government, or those guaranteed by it; (ii) obligations of the State of North Carolina; (iii) bank demand or time deposits; (iv) stock or obligations of the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund or a FHLB; (v) savings accounts of any savings institution as approved by the Bank Board; and (vi) stock or obligations of any agency of the State of North Carolina or of the U.S. Government or of any corporation doing business in North Carolina whose principal business is to make education loans. However, a North Carolina chartered savings bank cannot invest more than 15% of its total assets in business, commercial, corporate and agricultural loans, and cannot directly or indirectly acquire or retain any corporate debt security that is not of investment grade (generally referred to as “junk bonds”).
 
As a federally insured depository institution, the Bank is prohibited from engaging as principal in any activity, or acquiring or retaining any equity investment of a type or in an amount, that is not permitted for national banks unless (i) the FDIC determines that the activity or investment would pose no significant risk to the deposit insurance fund, and (ii) the Bank is, and continues to be, in compliance with all applicable capital standards.
 
In addition, the Bank is subject to various regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve including, without limitation, Regulation B (Equal Credit Opportunity), Regulation D (Reserves), Regulation E (Electronic Fund Transfers), Regulation O (Loans to Executive Officers, Directors and Principal Shareholders), Regulation W (Transactions Between Member Banks and Affiliates), Regulation Z (Truth in Lending), and Regulation CC (Availability of Funds).
 
The FDIC and Commissioner have broad powers to enforce laws and regulations applicable to the Bank. Among others, these powers include the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders, and to initiate injunctive actions. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and the conduct of unsafe and unsound practices.

Transactions with Affiliates. Under current federal law, depository institutions are subject to the restrictions contained in Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act with respect to loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders. Under Section 22(h), loans to directors, executive officers and shareholders who own more than 10% of a depository institution (18% in the case of institutions located in an area with less than 30,000 in population), and certain affiliated entities of any of the foregoing, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated entities, the institution’s loans-to-one-borrower limit (as discussed below). Section 22(h) also prohibits loans above amounts prescribed by the appropriate federal banking agency to directors, executive officers and shareholders who own more than 10% of an institution, and their respective affiliates, unless such loans are approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the institution. Any “interested” director may not participate in the voting. The FDIC has prescribed the loan amount (which includes all other outstanding loans to such person), as to which such prior board of directors approval is required, as being the greater of $25,000 or 5% of capital and surplus (up to $500,000). Further, pursuant to Section 22(h), the Federal Reserve requires that loans to directors, executive officers, and principal shareholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions with non-executive employees of the Bank. The FDIC has imposed additional limits on the amount a bank can loan to an executive officer.
 
Deposit Insurance. The deposit accounts of the Bank are insured by the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor.
 
The FDIC issues regulations and conducts periodic examinations, requires the filing of reports and generally supervises the operations of its insured banks. This supervision and regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors. Any insured bank that is not operated in accordance with or does not conform to FDIC regulations, policies and directives may be sanctioned for noncompliance. Civil and criminal proceedings may be instituted against any insured bank or any director, officer or employee of such bank for the violation of applicable laws and regulations, breaches of fiduciary duties or engaging in any unsafe or unsound practice. The FDIC has the authority to terminate insurance of accounts pursuant to procedures established for that purpose.
 
The Bank is subject to insurance assessments imposed by the FDIC. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessment system, which was amended pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005. Under this system, as amended, the assessment rates for an insured depository institution vary according to the level of risk incurred in its activities. To arrive at an assessment rate for a banking institution, the FDIC places it in one of four risk categories determined by reference to its capital levels and supervisory ratings. In addition, in the case of those institutions in the lowest risk category, the FDIC further determines its assessment rate based on certain specified financial ratios or, if applicable, its long-term debt ratings.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution’s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. In 2016, the FDIC adopted a rule increasing the deposit insurance fund’s minimum reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% by September 30, 2020, the cost of which increase is to be borne by depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more.
 
Community Reinvestment. Under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), as implemented by regulations of the FDIC, an insured institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions, nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop, consistent with the CRA, the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA requires the federal banking regulators, in connection with their examinations of insured institutions, to assess the institutions’ records of meeting the credit needs of their communities, using the ratings “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve,” or “substantial noncompliance,” and to take that record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by those institutions. All institutions are required to make public disclosure of their CRA performance ratings. The Bank received a “satisfactory” rating in its last CRA examination, which was completed during March 2014.

Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties.
 
Net Worth and Capital Adequacy Requirements Applicable to the Bank. The Bank is required to comply with the capital adequacy standards established by state and federal laws and regulations. The Commissioner requires that a savings bank maintains net worth not less than 5% of its total assets. Intangible assets must be deducted from net worth and assets when computing compliance with this requirement. The Bank complied with the net worth requirements as of December 31, 2016.
 
In addition, the FDIC has promulgated risk-based capital and leverage capital guidelines for determining the adequacy of a bank’s capital, and all applicable capital standards must be satisfied for the Bank to be considered in compliance with the FDIC’s requirements. Under the FDIC’s risk-based capital measure, the minimum ratio (total risk-based capital ratio) of a bank’s total capital to its risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance-sheet items, such as standby letters of credit) is 8.0%. At least half of total capital must be composed of common equity, undivided profits, minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (tier 1 capital). The remainder may consist of certain subordinated debt, certain hybrid capital instruments and other qualifying preferred stock, a limited amount of loan loss reserves, and net unrealized holding gains on equity securities (tier 2 capital). At December 31, 2016, the Bank’s total risk- based capital ratio and tier 1 risk-based capital ratio were 17.43% and 16.33%, respectively, each was well above the FDIC’s minimum risk-based capital guidelines. 
 
Under the FDIC’s leverage capital measure, the minimum ratio (the “tier 1 leverage capital ratio”) of tier 1 capital to total assets is 3.0% for banks that meet certain specified criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating. All other banks generally are required to maintain an additional cushion of 100 to 200 basis points above the stated minimum. The FDIC’s guidelines also provide that banks experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum levels without significant reliance on intangible assets, and the FDIC has indicated that it will consider a bank’s “tangible leverage ratio” (deducting all intangible assets) and other indicia of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities. At December 31, 2016, the Bank’s tier 1 leverage capital ratio was 11.06%, which was well above the FDIC’s minimum leverage capital guidelines.
 
Failure to meet the FDIC’s capital guidelines could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on the taking of brokered deposits, and certain other restrictions on its business. As described below, substantial additional restrictions can be imposed upon FDIC-insured depository institutions that fail to meet applicable capital requirements. See “– Prompt Corrective Action”. The FDIC also considers interest rate risk (arising when the interest rate sensitivity of an institution’s assets does not match the sensitivity of its liabilities or its off-balance-sheet position) in the evaluation of a bank’s capital adequacy.
 
In July 2013, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC approved revisions to their capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules that implement the revised standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly called Basel III, and address relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. “Basel III” refers to two consultative documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2009, the rules text released in December 2010, and loss absorbency rules issued in January 2011, which include significant changes to bank capital, leverage and liquidity requirements.

--

The new rules include new risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective January 1, 2015, and revise the definition of what constitutes “capital” for purposes of calculating those ratios. The new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank are: (i) a new common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a tier 1 capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from prior rules); and (iv) a tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The new rules eliminate the inclusion of certain instruments, such as trust preferred securities, from tier 1 capital. Instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 are grandfathered for companies with consolidated assets of $15 billion or less. The new rules also established a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity tier 1 capital and will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. At December 31, 2016, all of the Company’s and Bank’s capital ratios were well above the capital guidelines.
 
Loans-To-One-Borrower. The Bank is subject to the Commissioner’s loans-to-one-borrower limits on savings banks. Under these limits, no loans and extensions of credit to any borrower outstanding at one time and not fully secured by readily marketable collateral shall exceed 15% of the net worth of the savings bank. Loans and extensions of credit fully secured by readily marketable collateral may not exceed 10% of the net worth of the savings bank. This second limitation is separate from, and in addition to, the first limitation. These limits also authorize savings banks to make loans-to-one-borrower, for any purpose, in an amount not to exceed $500,000. A savings bank also is authorized to make loans-to-one-borrower to develop domestic residential housing units, not to exceed the lesser of $30 million or 30% of the savings bank’s net worth, provided that the purchase price of each single-family dwelling in the development does not exceed $500,000 and the aggregate amount of loans made pursuant to this authority does not exceed 150% of the savings bank’s net worth. These limits also authorize a savings bank to make loans-to-one-borrower to finance the sale of real property acquired in satisfaction of debts in an amount up to 50% of the savings bank’s net worth.
 
As of December 31, 2016, our legal loans-to-one borrower limit was $22.2 million, and at that date the largest aggregate amount of loans that the Bank had to any one borrower was $9.3 million.
 
Limits on Rates Paid on Deposits and Brokered Deposits. Regulations enacted by the FDIC place limitations on the ability of insured depository institutions to accept, renew or roll-over deposits by offering rates of interest which are significantly higher than the prevailing rates of interest on deposits offered by other insured depository institutions in the depository institution’s normal market area. Under these regulations, “well capitalized” depository institutions may accept, renew or roll-over such deposits without restriction, “adequately capitalized” depository institutions may accept, renew or roll-over such deposits with a waiver from the FDIC (subject to certain restrictions on payments of rates) and “undercapitalized” depository institutions may not accept, renew, or roll-over such deposits. The regulations contemplate that the definitions of “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized” and “undercapitalized” will be the same as the definitions adopted by the FDIC to implement the corrective action provisions discussed below. See “– Prompt Corrective Action,” below. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank exceeded all of the applicable regulatory capital ratios to be considered “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.
 
FHLB System. The FHLB System provides a central credit facility for member institutions. As a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, the Bank is required to own capital stock in the FHLB of Atlanta in an amount at least equal to 0.20% of the Bank’s total assets at the end of each calendar year, plus 4.5% of its outstanding advances (borrowings) from the FHLB of Atlanta. At December 31, 2016, the Bank was in compliance with these requirements.
 
Reserve Requirements. Pursuant to regulations of the Federal Reserve, all insured depository institutions must maintain average daily reserves against their transaction accounts equal to specified percentages of the balances of such accounts. These percentages are subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve. Because the Bank’s reserves are required to be maintained in the form of vault cash or in a noninterest-bearing account at a Federal Reserve bank, one effect of the reserve requirement is to reduce the amount of the Bank’s interest-earning assets. At December 31, 2016, the Bank met these reserve requirements.
  
16
--

Liquidity. The Bank is subject to the liquidity requirements established by the Commissioner. North Carolina law requires savings banks to maintain cash and readily marketable investments of not less than 10% of the savings bank’s total assets. The computation of liquidity under North Carolina regulation allows the inclusion of mortgage-backed securities and investments that, in the judgment of the Commissioner, have a readily marketable value, including investments with maturities in excess of five years. On December 31, 2016, the Bank’s liquidity ratio, calculated in accordance with North Carolina regulations, was approximately 15.9%.
 
Prompt Corrective Action. Federal law establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. Under this system, the FDIC has established five capital categories (“well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized”). The FDIC is required to take certain mandatory supervisory actions and is authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of any action taken will depend upon the capital category in which an institution is placed. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, current federal law requires the FDIC to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized.
 
Under the FDIC’s rules implementing the prompt corrective action provisions, an insured, state-chartered savings bank that (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a common equity tier 1 risk-based ratio of 6.5% or greater, and a leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or greater, and (ii) is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the FDIC, is deemed to be “well capitalized.” A savings bank with a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a common equity tier 1 risk-based ratio of 4.5% or greater, and a leverage capital ratio of 4.0% or greater (or 3.0% or greater in the case of an institution with the highest examination rating), is considered to be “adequately capitalized.” A savings bank that has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, or a leverage capital ratio of less than 4.0% (or 3.0% in the case of an institution with the highest examination rating), is considered to be “undercapitalized.” A savings bank that has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3.0%, a common equity tier 1 risk-based ratio of less than 4.5%, or a leverage capital ratio of less than 3.0%, is considered to be “significantly undercapitalized,” and a savings bank that has a ratio of tangible equity capital to assets equal to or less than 2.0% is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized.” For purposes of these rules, the term “tangible equity” includes core capital elements counted as tier 1 capital for purposes of the risk-based capital standards (see “—Net Worth and Capital Adequacy Requirements Applicable to the Bank” above), plus the amount of outstanding cumulative perpetual preferred stock (including related surplus), minus all intangible assets (with certain exceptions). A savings bank may be deemed to be in a capitalization category lower than indicated by its actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating.
 
A savings bank that is categorized as “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” or “critically undercapitalized,” is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to the FDIC. An “undercapitalized” savings bank also is generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches, or engaging in any new line of business, except in accordance with an accepted capital restoration plan or with the approval of the FDIC. In addition, the FDIC is given authority with respect to any “undercapitalized” savings bank to take any of the actions it is required to or may take with respect to a “significantly undercapitalized” savings bank if it determines that those actions are necessary to carry out the purpose of the law.
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Bank exceeded all of the applicable regulatory capital ratios to be considered “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.

Restrictions on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions. A North Carolina chartered stock savings bank may not declare or pay a cash dividend on, or repurchase any of, its capital stock if after making such distribution, the institution would become, or if it already is, “undercapitalized” (as such term is defined in the applicable law and regulations) or such transaction would reduce the net worth of the institution to an amount which is less than the minimum amount required by applicable federal and state regulations.
 
In addition, the Bank is not permitted to declare or pay a cash dividend or repurchase any of its capital stock if the effect thereof would be to cause its net worth to be reduced below the amount required for its liquidation account.
 
Other Federal and North Carolina Regulations. The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have developed joint regulations requiring disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and, to the extent feasible and practicable, supplemental disclosure of the estimated fair market value of assets and liabilities. Additional joint regulations require annual examinations of all insured depository institutions by the appropriate federal banking agency, with some exceptions for small, well-capitalized institutions and state-chartered institutions examined by state regulators, and establish operational and managerial, asset quality, earnings and stock valuation standards for insured depository institutions, as well as compensation standards when such compensation would endanger the insured depository institution or would constitute an unsafe practice.
 
The grounds for appointment of a conservator or receiver for a North Carolina savings bank on the basis of an institution’s financial condition include: (i) insolvency, in that the assets of the savings bank are less than its liabilities to depositors and others; (ii) substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (iii) existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; (iv) likelihood that the savings bank will be unable to meet the demands of its depositors or to pay its obligations in the normal course of business; and (v) insufficient capital or the incurring or likely incurring of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution’s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment of capital without federal assistance.
 
North Carolina law provides a procedure by which savings institutions may consolidate or merge, subject to approval of the Commissioner. The approval is conditioned upon findings by the Commissioner that, among other things, such merger or consolidation will promote the best interests of the members or shareholders of the merging institutions.

 TAXATION
 
Federal Taxation 
 
General. We are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to us.
 
Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, the Company files a consolidated tax return with the Bank, and reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a calendar year ending December 31 for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns.
 
Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, referred to as “alternative minimum taxable income.” The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount. Net operating losses can, in general, offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. At December 31, 2016, the Company had an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately $0.4 million.
 
Net Operating Loss Carryovers. Generally, a financial institution may carry back federal net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and carryforward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. At December 31, 2016, the Company had a $24.5 million net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes and a $28.5 million net operating loss carryforward for North Carolina income tax purposes. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Net Deferred Tax Assets”.
 
Corporate Dividends. The Company is able to exclude from its income 100% of the dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.
 
Audit of Tax Returns. The Company’s federal income tax returns have not been audited in the most recent five-year period.
 
State Taxation 
 
The State of North Carolina imposes an income tax on income measured substantially the same as federally taxable income, except that U.S. Government interest is not fully taxable. During the third quarter of 2013, North Carolina reduced its corporate income tax rate from 6.9% to 6.0% effective January 1, 2014, and to 5.0% effective January 1, 2015. The rate was further reduced to 4.0% for the 2016 tax year and to 3.0% effective January 2, 2017. Our state income tax returns have not been audited in the most recent five-year period. Under North Carolina law, we are also subject to an annual franchise tax at a rate of 0.15% of equity. Effective for tax periods beginning January 1, 2017, the North Carolina franchise tax related to the holding company will increase to a maximum of $150,000 from $75,000 for prior periods. There is no maximum amount for the North Carolina franchise tax related to the Bank.
