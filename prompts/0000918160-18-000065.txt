Item 1. | Business.

Overview
AK Steel Holding Corporation (“AK Holding”) was formed under the laws of Delaware in 1993. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, AK Steel Corporation (“AK Steel”), it is a leading producer of flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steel products, primarily for the automotive, infrastructure and manufacturing, electrical power generation and distribution markets. AK Holding’s subsidiaries also provide customer solutions with carbon and stainless steel tubing products, tool design, hot- and cold-stamped steel components and assemblies. AK Steel is the successor to Armco Inc., and has built upon Armco’s rich history of creating leading-edge steel innovations since its formation in 1899. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to “we,” “us” and “our” refer to AK Holding and its subsidiaries.
Our mission is to create innovative, high-quality steel solutions for our customers in a safe, responsible and profitable manner, and our key values of safety, quality, productivity and innovation, along with environmental responsibility and sustainability, are the foundation of our mission. Our approximately 9,200 employees at manufacturing operations across seven states in the eastern U.S., as well as in Canada and Mexico, continue our legacy of innovation and operational excellence across markets and within our product portfolios to meet and surpass our customers’ needs for high-value steel products. We are the only steelmaker in North America that can produce all three major categories of flat-rolled steels—carbon, stainless and electrical. In 2017, we enhanced our portfolio of steel solutions by acquiring PPHC Holdings, LLC (“Precision Partners”), which provides advanced-engineered solutions, tool design and build, hot- and cold-stamped steel components and complex assemblies for the automotive market. In 2014, we acquired Severstal Dearborn, LLC, which primarily consisted of the integrated steelmaking assets located in Dearborn, Michigan, and the Mountain State Carbon, LLC cokemaking facility located in Follansbee, West Virginia.
Customers and Markets
We target customers who require the most technically demanding, highest-quality steel products, precise “just-in-time” delivery, technical support and product development assistance. Our enhanced product quality and delivery capabilities, as well as our emphasis on collaborative customer technical support and product planning, are critical factors in our ability to serve our customer markets. Our strategy is to focus on markets for our steel products that deliver higher margins, where possible, and reduce amounts sold into the lower margin steel spot markets, which have experienced substantial volatility in pricing over the past several years primarily as a result of the impact of low-priced, unfairly traded imports of foreign steel.
We sell our products to customers in three broad market categories: (i) automotive; (ii) infrastructure and manufacturing; and (iii) distributors and converters. The following table presents the percentage of our net sales to each of these markets:

Market | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
Automotive | | % | | | % | 60 | %
Infrastructure and Manufacturing | 16 | % | | 16 | % | 16 | %
Distributors and Converters | 19 | % | | 18 | % | 24 | %

We sold approximately 70% of our flat-rolled steel shipments in 2017 under fixed base price contracts. These contracts are typically for one year and expire at various times throughout the year. Some of these contracts have a surcharge mechanism that passes through certain changes in input costs. We sold the remainder of our flat-rolled steel shipments in 2017 into the spot market at prevailing market prices or under annual contracts that have pricing provisions that are typically linked to a steel index with price adjustments based on a previous monthly or quarterly reference point.
Automotive Market
The automotive industry is our core market. We aim to address the principal needs of major automotive manufacturers and their suppliers, as we specialize in producing hard-to-make, high-quality steel products combined with demanding delivery performance, customer technical support and collaborative efforts to develop breakthrough solutions to help our customers meet their product requirements. In addition, many competitors do not have the capability to supply all of the products that we make for our automotive customers, such as steel for exposed automotive applications, the most advanced grades of advanced high strength steels (“AHSS”) and value-added stainless chrome products. The exacting requirements for servicing the automotive market generally enable us to obtain higher selling prices than sales of more commodity types of carbon and stainless steels to other markets.

In light of the automotive market’s importance to us, North American light vehicle production has a significant impact on our total sales and shipments. North American light vehicle production for 2017 declined slightly to approximately 17.1 million units, representing a 3% decrease from the prior year. However, production declined more in the United States and Canada, where most of our steel is used. Demand for SUVs, crossovers and larger vehicles continued to increase while demand for smaller sedans and compact cars declined, and we benefited from intentionally targeting larger vehicle platforms to take advantage of the trend. In addition to benefiting from our exposure to consumers’ strong demand for larger vehicles, these vehicles also typically contain a higher volume of steel than smaller sedans and compact cars, providing us the opportunity to sell a greater proportion of our steel products to our automotive customers. Reflecting our concentration in the automotive industry, Ford Motor Company accounted for 12% of our net sales in each of 2017 and 2016, with FCA US LLC (an affiliate of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.) accounting for 11% of our net sales in 2016 but less than 10% of net sales in 2017. No other customer represented more than 10% of our net sales in either year.
Automotive manufacturers are under pressure to achieve heightened federally mandated fuel economy standards through 2025 (the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or “CAFE,” standards). The CAFE standards generally require automobile manufacturers to meet an average fuel economy goal of 54.5 miles per gallon across the fleet of vehicles they produce by the year 2025, with certain milestones to be met in interim periods. As a result, our automotive customers are currently exploring various avenues for achieving the standards, including lightweighting of components and developing more efficient engines. Lightweighting efforts include testing alternatives to traditional carbon steels, such as AHSS, aluminum and other materials. This could reduce the aggregate volume of steel consumed by the automotive industry and impact our share of that volume. However, we believe there will be an increase in the demand for current and next-generation AHSS and our AHSS and other innovative steels will command values that will be margin enhancing. Therefore, we are working very closely with our automotive customers and their suppliers to develop innovative solutions using our developments in lightweighting, efficiency, strength, ductility and formability across our extensive product portfolio, in combination with our stamping capabilities. We are also working with our customers to develop heat-resistant steels for exhaust systems that can accommodate new engines running at higher temperatures to increase fuel economy.
Automotive manufacturers have also been increasing their development of hybrid/electric vehicles (“H/EVs”) in order to respond to the CAFE standards and growing customer acceptance of H/EVs. Many motors used in H/EVs being sold in the U.S. today are imported from foreign suppliers, but a trend toward local sourcing and manufacturing appears to be underway. We believe our strong foundation in electrical steels and collaboration with automotive manufacturers will provide us with an advantage in this market as it grows and matures in the future.
Infrastructure and Manufacturing Market
The infrastructure and manufacturing market primarily represents sales to manufacturers of power transmission and distribution transformers, who produce equipment for the electrical grid, as well as manufacturers of heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment and appliances. Domestic construction activity and the replacement of aging infrastructure directly affects sales of our carbon, stainless and electrical steel products, particularly for grain-oriented electrical steel (“GOES”). Housing starts in the U.S. improved approximately 2% over the prior year, and we expect a general lift in demand for a variety of our steel products as new construction accelerates. Over a longer timeframe, we believe that the growth of H/EVs may drive higher demand for GOES to use in the electrical infrastructure necessary to support the charging needs for this additional demand for electricity.
In January 2016, new higher efficiency standards for electrical distribution transformers went into effect in the United States, which strengthened the domestic demand for GOES products. However, electrical steel pricing declined in many international markets, which resulted in GOES imports into the U.S. doubling in 2017 from 2016 and suppressing domestic electrical steel pricing in 2017. We continue to assess various alternatives to ensure that foreign producers of GOES are required to comply with U.S. trade laws, including encouraging the vigorous enforcement of existing laws and regulations.
Distributors and Converters Market
Steel distributors and converters typically source from the commodity carbon, stainless and electrical spot markets. Demand and pricing can be highly dependent on a variety of factors outside of our control, including global and domestic capacity of commodity steel products, the relative health of countries’ economies and whether they are consuming or exporting excess steel capacity, the nature of international trade agreements and international currencies, in addition to other factors, and therefore are subject to a high degree of volatility. Because of this volatility and our strategy to rationalize sales of unprofitable business, we have been reducing our exposure to this market.

Geographic Presence
We sell our carbon steel products principally to customers in North America, and we sell our electrical and stainless steel products primarily in North America and Europe. Our customer base is geographically diverse and there is no single country outside the U.S. where our sales are material compared to our total net sales. Our material long-lived assets are located in the United States and Canada. The following shows net sales by geographic area and as a percentage of worldwide net sales:

 | 2017 | | 2016 | 2015 
Geographic Area | Net Sales | | % | Net Sales | | % | | Net Sales | %
United States | $ | 5,453.4 | | 90 | % | | $ | 5,226.9 | | 89 | % | $ | 5,837.2 | | 87 | %
Foreign countries | 627.1 | | | % | | 655.6 | | | % | | 855.7 | | 13 | %
Total | $ | 6,080.5 | | 100 | % | | $ | 5,882.5 | | 100 | % | $ | 6,692.9 | | 100 | %

Research, Innovation and Product Development
Our vision is to create innovative steel products and processes that surpass our customers’ needs today and for the future. Our product portfolio includes all the major categories of flat-rolled steel—carbon, stainless and electrical—and carbon and stainless tubular products. We are unwavering in our quality expectations, and we take a planned approach to continuously improve our products, processes and services. This approach is key to our strategic partnerships with our customers and earns awards from them, like the “Raw Material Supplier of the Year” award for 2017 from FCA US LLC. The award recognizes companies that have shown extraordinary commitment to innovation, quality, warranty, cost, delivery and FCA’s foundational principles, and we were the only steel company to receive the award in 2017.
Providing new, innovative products and breakthrough solutions is a strategic priority, as we believe differentiation of higher value carbon, stainless and electrical steels to meet challenging applications enables us to maintain and enhance our margins. We conduct a broad range of research and development activities aimed at improving existing products and developing new products, and our tradition of leading steel innovation has produced a highly diversified flat-rolled steel product line. In recent years, we have increased our historic commitment to research and development with greater investment in research and innovation, both in personnel and capabilities. To support the cutting-edge efforts of our researchers and engineers, in 2016 we opened our new, state-of-the-art Research and Innovation Center in Middletown, Ohio.
Carbon Steel 
We sell flat-rolled carbon steel products, consisting of premium-quality coated, cold-rolled, and hot-rolled carbon steel products, primarily to automotive manufacturers and their suppliers, as well as to customers in the infrastructure and manufacturing market. We also sell carbon steel products to distributors, service centers and converters, who may further process these products before reselling them. We are particularly focused on AHSS for the automotive market, and we produce virtually every AHSS grade that our customers currently need. Our automotive customers have incorporated into their products our AHSS grades, such as Dual Phase 780 and 980, for both stamped and roll-formed parts. In addition, we are currently the only domestic steel company that is marketing a groundbreaking third-generation AHSS product, which has unparalleled strength and formability attributes that may give automotive manufacturers unique opportunities for designing future vehicle platforms.
Looking forward, we have developed the next generation of AHSS with even greater strength and formability, and we believe that our addition of Precision Partners dramatically accelerates our efforts to drive adoption of our innovative steel products by automotive manufacturers and their Tier 1 suppliers. Our research and technical experts, along with Precision Partners’ engineers, have already begun numerous collaboration projects aimed at achieving this goal, as Precision Partners’ expertise in tool design and stamping capabilities has allowed us to deliver to customers fully formed prototypes of automotive components utilizing our innovative steel products. As such, we are now able to provide true component solutions through prototype automotive parts, rather than attempting to showcase our advanced steels to customers through computer models and flat-rolled steel samples, as in the past. This approach has and will continue to demonstrate to customers that they can significantly lightweight automotive parts on an accelerated timeline and in a cost-effective manner by using our high-strength, highly formable grades of steel in place of traditional lower-strength grades. In addition, these collaborative projects are enhancing Precision Partners’ knowledge and experience in tool design and build, and stamping of new, advanced grades of steel, enabling it to provide expert solutions to automotive customers now and in the future.
Press-Hardenable Steel
We continue to develop innovative press-hardenable steel (“PHS”) products for hot-stamping applications that achieve lightweighting solutions for our customers. Our ULTRALUME® PHS is an aluminized Type 1 heat-treatable boron steel our customers depend on when they require high-strength parts with complex geometries. These steels enable automotive manufacturers to reduce vehicle 
- 3-


weight while continuing to keep pace with critical safety requirements. In addition, our acquisition of Precision Partners, which provides hot-stamping and advanced-engineered solutions and tool design and build solutions to automotive customers, strategically advances our mission to innovate in the high-growth automotive lightweighting space and helps enhance our position in hot-stamping technology.
Third-Generation Advanced High-Strength Steel
We continue to push our innovation efforts toward groundbreaking steel technologies. Our NEXMET™ 440EX product is intended for automotive manufacturers to use in surface-critical, exposed auto body panels. We introduced our NEXMET 1000 and NEXMET 1200 AHSS products to enable our customers to achieve significant lightweighting in their automobiles’ unexposed structural components. NEXMET 1200, for example, has better global formability than conventional dual phase 600 steel, at twice the strength level. These AHSS products allow automotive engineers to design lightweight parts that meet rigorous service and safety requirements. We supplied demonstration samples of coated NEXMET 1000 and NEXMET 1200 AHSS products to numerous automotive customers in 2017 as a key step in the material qualification process. The NEXMET family of steels helps our customers achieve vehicle weight savings for ambitious fuel efficiency standards while avoiding significant capital costs required to re-design production facilities to use alternative materials in their vehicles. We introduced these solutions after completing a strategically vital upgrade of our state-of-the-art continuous galvanizing line at our Dearborn Works facility. Enhanced furnace technology and modifications to the line’s configuration expanded the line’s capabilities to enable it to also operate as a continuous anneal line.
We believe the combination of Precision Partners’ cold-stamping and advanced die-making capabilities, AK Tube LLC’s (“AK Tube”) advanced tubemaking capabilities and AK Steel’s new product introductions will enhance our ability to deliver innovative, lightweighting solutions for our customers. We anticipate that 3rd Gen AHSS products with high strength and formability will enable automotive manufacturers opportunities to stamp and form lightweight parts using traditional manufacturing methods, at a lower cost than aluminum or other materials.
Our innovation initiatives include collaborations with other companies, such as The NanoSteel Company. During 2016, we delivered NanoSteel® NXG™ 1200, a third-generation, advanced high-strength steel (“3rd Gen AHSS”), to several automotive manufacturers for testing and evaluation. This 3rd Gen AHSS solution, produced at our facilities using proprietary production methods, possesses a unique combination of high ultimate tensile strength and high material formability that we believe represents a leap in performance over many other AHSS products.
Specialty Stainless and Electrical Steel
We continue to develop new and improved specialty stainless and electrical steels for expanding applications in the automotive, infrastructure and manufacturing, and other markets. We are working with our automotive customers and their exhaust system suppliers to develop new stainless steels for exhaust systems that must support engines running at higher temperatures that are needed to achieve increased fuel economy. Our new steels’ capabilities demonstrate improved thermal fatigue and corrosion resistance. We are also developing innovative solutions for customers in other markets. For example, we are developing steels with specialized finishes and colors to provide differentiation and cost savings solutions for our customers in the architectural and appliance markets.
We are a global leader in producing the highest-quality electrical steel products, and our electrical steels are among the most energy efficient in the world. We sell our electrical steel products, which are iron-silicon alloys with unique magnetic properties, primarily to manufacturers of power transmission and distribution transformers and electrical motors and generators, in the infrastructure and manufacturing markets. These customers desire the highest-quality electrical steels that provide the low core loss and high permeability required for more efficient and economical electrical transformers, which help to lower costs of electricity distribution.
We focus on the high-end of the electrical steel market, as GOES is technically challenging to produce and typically commands a higher selling price than grades of non-oriented electrical steel (“NOES”). We believe the superior efficiency of our GOES products is attractive to customers in markets with increasing efficiency standards, such as Europe and the United States.
In May 2017, the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) selected AK Steel to receive an award under the Advanced Manufacturing Office’s Next Generation Electric Machines program to develop the next generation of advanced NOES for motors used in a wide variety of industrial and automotive applications. The three-year project will be conducted in collaboration with the DOE, Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Power Electronics and Electric Machinery Research Center, and Regal Beloit Corporation, a leading manufacturer of electric motors and motion control products. We will receive up to $1.8 to jointly develop an innovative motor design with high-alloy NOES with a goal to achieve an efficiency improvement of more than 30% when compared to existing motor designs. While the program targets a vast array of industrial motors, pumps and generators, we intend to use the research from this project in NOES applications for H/EVs since they represent one of the fastest growing markets for NOES. This could be a transformational step forward if we are successful in this project as it would provide a substantial enhancement to the range of battery electric vehicles.

Sustainability
We are committed to operating in a sustainable manner. Beyond ensuring that we are acting responsibly to serve our communities and the environment, operating AK Steel sustainably also provides us opportunities to grow our business, increase customer collaboration and loyalty, attract, retain and motivate employees, and differentiate us from our steel and non-steel competitors. Steel is the most recycled material on the planet—more than aluminum, plastic, paper and glass combined each year—which provides a strong foundation for our sustainability efforts across the company.
Safety
The safety of our employees is a core value for us. Our occupational health and safety policies and programs are the cornerstone of our operating philosophy and are integrated into all of our daily operations and activities. We rigorously manage, control and focus on eliminating or minimizing potential exposure to the hazards associated with making and working with steel. Our low recordable injury rate, based on U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) criteria, reflects our effectiveness in protecting our employees. In 2017, three of our facilities operated with zero OSHA recordable injuries for the entire year, and five of our facilities operated with zero OSHA recordable injuries during the fourth quarter. We also consistently lead the U.S. steel industry in safety, outperforming the steel industry average injury frequencies for each of the last ten years, and we have received numerous awards recognizing our safety performance. For example, in 2017 our Coshocton Works and Zanesville Works both received the “Special Award for Safety” from the Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation, division of Safety and Hygiene (“Ohio BWC”), recognizing more than 500,000 hours and at least six months without an injury resulting in a day or more away from work. In 2017, Zanesville Works also received the Ohio BWC’s “100% Award,” recognizing zero injuries or illnesses resulting in a day or more away from work during the previous year. Our 2017 performance at our steelmaking facilities (year-to-date through the third quarter, which is the latest industry information currently available), measured as the number of OSHA recordable injuries per 200,000 labor hours, was 0.34, which was more than four times better than the industry average. This 2017 performance was also an improvement over our 2016 OSHA recordable injury rate of 0.44 per 200,000 labor hours, which again led the domestic steel industry during that year.
Environmental Responsibility
We maintain an unwavering commitment to responsible environmental performance throughout our operations. In 2017 we experienced another year of outstanding environmental performance overall, as well as setting records at several of our individual facilities. Under the Clean Water Act, our steelmaking facilities recorded only two water discharge permit exceedances in 2017, which we believe was an all-time low for us. Under the Clean Air Act, in 2017 we recorded our lowest total number of Title V air permit deviations in the last five years. We are particularly proud of the achievements that we have made to improve the air permit performance of Dearborn Works since our acquisition. In 2013, the last year that Dearborn Works was operated under its former ownership and not AK Steel, it experienced over 24,000 air permit deviations. In 2017, the third full year of AK Steel’s ownership of Dearborn Works, it experienced only ten deviations. Although we strive for zero deviations at all of our facilities, this performance represents over a 99.9% improvement for air permit performance at Dearborn Works since we acquired the plant.
We believe that our strong environmental performance is a direct result of the proactive approach we take to environmental management and the close collaborative efforts that we undertake across the company. We target sustainable performance in all aspects of our operations, including continuous improvement in operations that include air, water and waste management. Our comprehensive environmental policy provides that we will:

• | commit the necessary resources to comply with all applicable environmental laws, regulations, permits and agreements applicable to us;


• | reduce environmental risks through operating practices and emergency preparedness programs;


• | encourage recycling, recovery and reuse of residual materials, as well as the reduction and prevention of emissions and releases when feasible;


• | participate in efforts to develop and implement environmental laws and regulations;


• | continually evaluate compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations; and


• | strive for continually improving the effectiveness of our environmental management efforts.

Certain production units in our operations are inherently water-intensive. However, we continuously seek opportunities to reduce water usage and increase water reuse at our steelmaking plants. In addition, our steelmaking facilities are located near abundant sources of water and we do not believe that any of those operations are located in regions that experience high water stress.
The International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) has certified all of our steelmaking plants with ISO 14001 environmental management certification, and our environmental affairs professionals oversee environmental compliance throughout our organization. We also invest heavily in equipment to help meet our environmental objectives. For example, in 2017, we spent $129.5 to operate and maintain our environmental controls and invested $6.8 in environmental projects.

Strategic Opportunities Related to Climate Change
Our strategy of creating new innovative steels and improving existing products enables us to contribute to carbon reduction efforts and the achievement of sustainability goals down the product supply chain. Innovative products in each of the carbon, stainless, electrical and tubular steel families further the sustainability goals of many of our customers. For example, in the automotive market our customers are benefiting from our carbon lightweighting solutions to meet their heightened fuel economy targets under the CAFE standards. We are also providing customers with stainless steel and tubular solutions that allow for greater heat resistance in vehicle exhaust systems, enabling exhaust systems to handle the higher engine exhaust temperatures needed for increased fuel economy. In addition, we continue to develop higher-efficiency NOES products for use in future H/EVs and GOES products for their required infrastructure, a market that we anticipate will grow over time. Our steels also contribute to sustainability goals beyond the automotive market. For instance, our GOES products are among the highest-efficiency electrical steels in the world. These GOES products provide low core loss and high permeability to move electricity across electrical grids in the U.S. and around the world more efficiently through better-performing electrical transformers.
While greenhouse gas emissions are a natural byproduct of steel manufacturing today, we continue to take steps to increase energy efficiency while remaining competitive in the global steel marketplace. For example, through the American Iron and Steel Institute (“AISI”), we participate in the DOE’s Climate VISION agreement. This program assists domestic steelmakers in their continued efforts to lead the global steel sector in voluntary emissions reductions. We are also a member of the federal ENERGY STAR program, which identifies and promotes energy-efficient products to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ENERGY STAR is a joint program of the EPA and DOE, helping businesses and consumers save money and protect the environment through energy-efficient products and practices. As with other companies engaged in the production of steel, certain aspects of our production process are carbon-intensive and current technology does not currently afford us the ability to dramatically lower our direct greenhouse gas emissions without significantly reducing the scope of our operations. However, we and other steel producers in the United States are actively participating in research and development to develop technology, processes and approaches to reduce emissions during the steelmaking processes, but these developments are likely to occur over the longer term.
In addition, the production phase of steelmaking is less carbon-intensive than the processes for producing certain other competing materials, such as aluminum. Thus, while the CAFE standards have motivated the use of aluminum in some vehicles to help achieve lightweighting goals, we intend to continue to educate governments, the automotive industry and other key stakeholders that steel is the most sustainable metal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the life cycle of a vehicle. These benefits are even greater for customers utilizing our advanced steel products for lightweighting.
Production Resources
Employees
Approximately 5,700 of our 9,200 employees are represented by labor unions. The labor contracts covering these represented employees expire between 2018 and 2021. See the discussion under Labor Agreements in Item 7 for additional information on these agreements.
Raw Materials and Other Inputs
Our steel manufacturing operations require carbon and stainless steel scrap, coal, coke, chrome, iron ore, nickel and zinc as primary raw materials. We also use natural gas, electricity, electrodes and industrial gases. We typically purchase carbon and stainless steel scrap, natural gas, a substantial portion of our electricity and most other raw materials at prevailing market prices, which may fluctuate with market supply and demand. However, we make most of our purchases of iron ore, coke, industrial gases and a portion of our electricity at negotiated prices under annual or multi-year agreements with periodic price adjustments. We purchase substantially all our iron ore from one supplier under multi-year contracts. We typically purchase most of our metallurgical coal under annual fixed-price agreements, but we also obtain approximately 15% of our metallurgical coal needs from our own mine at AK Coal Resources, Inc. (“AK Coal”). Additionally, we may hedge portions of our energy and raw materials purchases to reduce volatility and risk, which is discussed in more detail in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 7A.
We also attempt to reduce the risk of future supply shortages and price volatility in other ways. If multi-year contracts are available in the marketplace, we may use these contracts to secure enough supply to satisfy our key raw material needs. When multi-year contracts are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we purchase the remainder of our raw materials needs under annual contracts or make spot purchases. We also regularly evaluate alternative sources and substitute materials. We believe that we have secured, or will be able to secure, adequate supply sources for our raw materials and energy requirements for 2018.

Competition
We principally compete with domestic and foreign producers of flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steel, carbon and stainless tubular products, aluminum, carbon fiber, concrete and other materials that may be used as a substitute for flat-rolled steels in manufactured products. With the acquisition of Precision Partners, we also compete against other tooling and stamping companies in a highly fragmented market.
Price, quality, on-time delivery, customer service and product innovation are the primary competitive factors in the steel industry and vary in importance according to the product category and customer requirements. Steel producers that sell to the automotive market are facing increasing competition from aluminum manufacturers (and, to a lesser extent, other materials) as automotive manufacturers attempt to develop vehicles that will enable them to satisfy more stringent, government-imposed fuel efficiency standards. To address automotive manufacturers’ lightweighting needs that the aluminum industry is targeting, we and others in the steel industry are developing AHSS grades that we believe provide weight savings similar to aluminum, while being stronger, less costly, more sustainable, easier to repair and more environmentally friendly. In addition, our automotive customers who continue to use steel, as opposed to aluminum and other alternative materials, are able to forego the significant capital expenditures required to re-tool their manufacturing process in order for their operations to accommodate the use of non-steel materials.
Mini-mills generally offer a narrower range of products than integrated steel mills, but have been expanding their product capabilities in recent years. In addition, mini-mills have some competitive cost advantages as a result of their different production processes and lower labor costs associated with what are often non-union workforces. However, mini-mills do not have the equipment capabilities to produce all of the products that we offer, nor do they possess our depth of research and development. For example, mini-mills do not strategically target demanding automotive sheet applications for the exposed panels of vehicles, which is one of the technically challenging products in which we specialize.
Domestic steel producers, including us, face significant competition from foreign producers. For many reasons, these foreign producers often are able to sell products in the U.S. at prices substantially lower than domestic producers. Depending on the country of production, these reasons may include generous government subsidies; lower labor, raw material, energy and regulatory costs; less stringent environmental regulations; less stringent safety requirements; the maintenance of artificially low exchange rates against the U.S. dollar; and preferential trade practices in their home countries. In recent years, the annual level of imports of foreign steel into the United States has increased over historical levels and is affected to varying degrees by the relative level of steel production in China and other countries, the strength of demand for steel outside the U.S. and the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against various foreign currencies.
In 2015, the combination of overcapacity and slowing domestic demand in countries such as China resulted in imports of low-priced foreign steel into the U.S. at levels significantly higher than previous periods. As the supply of imported steel surged, it caused dramatic downward pressure on the price of flat-rolled steels in the American marketplace. Imports of finished steel into the United States accounted for approximately 27%, 26% and 29% of domestic steel market consumption in 2017, 2016 and 2015, levels that are higher than the historic norm. During 2016, we successfully concluded the anti-dumping (“AD”) and countervailing duty (“CVD”) cases that we and other major domestic steel producers initiated in 2015 against imports of corrosion-resistant (“Coated”), cold-rolled and hot-rolled carbon steel products from multiple foreign countries. The final duties determined by the United States Department of Commerce (“Commerce Department”), which in some cases exceed 400% for combined AD and CVD duties, will remain in effect for a minimum of five years.
Following those determinations, in September 2016, we and other domestic producers made filings with the Commerce Department asserting that Chinese steel producers are attempting to circumvent the AD and CVD duties against Coated and cold-rolled carbon steel by transshipping Chinese steel through Vietnam for minor processing before importing these final steel products into the U.S. market. On December 5, 2017, the Commerce Department announced preliminary affirmative rulings that Coated and cold-rolled carbon steel imported from Vietnam produced from steel that originated in China is circumventing existing AD and CVD orders on these products imported from China. The Commerce Department instructed the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to begin collecting cash deposits on all imports of Coated and cold-rolled carbon steel produced in Vietnam using Chinese-origin steel.
In addition, during the first quarter of 2017, pursuant to trade cases that we and other domestic producers of stainless steel initiated, the Commerce Department assessed final duties against Chinese stainless steel imports, which in some cases exceed 265% for combined AD and CVD duties. These duties will remain in effect for a minimum of five years.
We continue to provide pension and healthcare benefits to a great number of our retirees, resulting in a competitive disadvantage compared to certain other domestic and foreign steel producers that do not provide such benefits to any or most of their retirees. However, we have taken a number of actions to reduce pension and healthcare benefits costs, including negotiating progressive labor agreements that have significantly reduced total employment costs at all of our union-represented facilities, transferring all responsibility for healthcare benefits for various groups of retirees to Voluntary Employee Benefits Association trusts, 
- 7-


offering voluntary lump-sum settlements to pension plan participants, lowering retiree benefit costs for salaried employees, and transferring pension obligations to a highly rated insurance company. These actions have not only reduced some of the risks associated with our pension fund obligations, but more importantly have reduced our risk exposure to the financial markets that drive pension funding requirements. We continue to actively seek opportunities to reduce pension and healthcare benefits costs.
