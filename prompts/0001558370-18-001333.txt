     ITEM 1. BUSINESS
     Overview 
     Cardtronics plc provides convenient automated consumer financial services through its network of automated teller machines and multi-function financial services kiosks (collectively referred to as “ATMs”). As of December 31, 2017, we were the world’s largest ATM owner/operator, providing services to over 230,000 ATMs. 
     During 2017, 64.4% of our revenues were derived from our operations in North America (including our ATM operations in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico), 26.8% of our revenues were derived from our operations in Europe and Africa (including our ATM operations in the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Spain, South Africa and the recently exited operations in Poland which accounted for less than 1% of total revenues), and 8.8% of our revenues were derived from our operations in Australia and New Zealand. Included in our network as of December 31, 2017, were approximately 134,000 ATMs to which we provided processing only services or various forms of managed services solutions. Under a managed services arrangement, retailers, financial institutions, and ATM distributors rely on us to handle some or all of the operational aspects associated with operating and maintaining ATMs, typically in exchange for a monthly service fee, fee per transaction, or fee per service provided.
     Through our network, we deliver financial related services to cardholders and provide ATM management and ATM equipment-related services (typically under multi-year contracts) to large retail merchants, smaller retailers, and operators of facilities such as shopping malls, airports, and train stations. In doing so, we provide our retail partners with a compelling automated financial services solution that helps attract and retain customers, and in turn, increases the likelihood that our ATMs will be utilized. We also own and operate electronic funds transfer (“EFT”) transaction processing platforms that provide transaction processing services to our network of ATMs, as well as to other ATMs under managed services arrangements. Additionally, in Canada, through our acquisition of DirectCash Payments Inc. (“DCPayments”), we also provide processing services for issuers of debit cards. 
     We generally operate ATMs under three arrangement types with our retail partners: Company-owned ATM placements, merchant-owned ATM placements, and managed services (which includes transaction processing services). Under Company-owned arrangements, we provide the physical ATM and are typically responsible for all aspects of the ATM’s operations, including transaction processing, managing cash and cash delivery, supplies, and telecommunications, as well as routine and technical maintenance. Under merchant-owned arrangements, the retail merchant or an independent distributor owns the ATM and is usually responsible for providing cash and performing simple maintenance tasks, while we provide more complex maintenance services, transaction processing, and connection to the EFT networks. We also offer various forms of managed services, depending on the needs of our customers. Each managed service arrangement is a customized ATM management solution that can include any combination of the following services: monitoring, maintenance, cash management, cash delivery, customer service, transaction processing, and other services. As of December 31, 2017, 35.3% of our ATMs operated were Company-owned and 64.7% of our ATMs were merchant-owned or operated under a managed services solution. Each of the arrangement types described above are attractive to us, and we plan to continue growing our revenues under each arrangement type.
     In addition to our retail merchant relationships, we also partner with leading financial institutions to brand selected ATMs within our network, including BBVA Compass Bancshares, Inc. (“BBVA”), Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”), Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (“Citizens”), Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (“Cullen/Frost”), Discover Bank (“Discover”), PNC Bank, N.A. (“PNC Bank”), Santander Bank, N.A. (“Santander”), and TD Bank, N.A. (“TD Bank”) in the U.S.; the Bank of Nova Scotia (“Scotiabank”), TD Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank Commerce (“CIBC”), and DirectCash Bank in Canada; and Bank of Queensland Limited (“BOQ”) and HSBC Holdings plc (“HSBC”) in Australia. In Mexico, we partner with Scotiabank to place their brands on our ATMs in exchange for certain services provided by them. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 20,000 of our ATMs were under contract with approximately 500 financial institutions to place their logos on the ATMs, and to provide convenient surcharge-free access for their banking customers.

 We also own and operate the Allpoint network (“Allpoint”), the largest surcharge-free ATM network (based on the number of participating ATMs). Allpoint, with approximately 55,000 participating ATMs, provides surcharge-free ATM access to over 1,000 participating banks, credit unions, and stored-value debit card issuers. For participants, Allpoint provides scale, density, and convenience of surcharge-free ATMs that surpasses the largest banks in the U.S. In exchange, Allpoint earns either a fixed monthly fee per cardholder or a fixed fee per transaction that is paid by participants. The Allpoint network includes a majority of our Company-owned ATMs in the U.S., a portion of our Company-owned ATMs in the U.K., Canada, Puerto Rico, and Mexico as well as certain ATMs in Australia. Allpoint also works with financial institutions that manage stored-value debit card programs on behalf of corporate entities and governmental agencies, including general purpose, payroll, and electronic benefits transfer (“EBT”) cards. Under these programs, the issuing financial institutions pay Allpoint a fee per issued stored-value debit card or per transaction in return for allowing the users of those cards surcharge-free access to Allpoint’s participating ATM network.
     Our revenues are generally recurring in nature, and historically have been derived largely from convenience transaction fees, which are paid by cardholders, as well as other transaction-based fees, including interchange fees, which are paid by the cardholder’s financial institution for the use of the ATMs serving their customers and connectivity to the applicable EFT network that transmits data between the ATM and the cardholder’s financial institution. Other revenue sources include: (i) fees for branding our ATMs with the logos of financial institutions and providing financial institution cardholders with surcharge free access, (ii) revenues earned by providing managed services (including transaction processing services) solutions to retailers and financial institutions, (iii) fees from financial institutions that participate in our Allpoint surcharge-free network, (iv) fees earned from foreign currency exchange transactions at the ATM, known as dynamic currency conversion, and (v) revenues from the sale of ATMs and ATM-related equipment and other ancillary services. 
     Organizational and Operational History
     We were formed as a Texas corporation in 1993 and originally operated under the name of Cardpro, Inc. In June 2001, Cardtronics Group, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware and became the parent company for the existing business. In January 2004, Cardtronics Group, Inc. changed its name to Cardtronics, Inc. (“Cardtronics Delaware”). In December 2007, we completed an initial public offering of 12,000,000 common shares. 
     In July 2016, the location of incorporation of the parent company of the Cardtronics group of companies was changed from Delaware to the U.K., whereby Cardtronics plc, a public limited company organized under English law (“Cardtronics plc”), became the new publicly traded corporate parent of the Cardtronics group of companies following the completion of the merger between Cardtronics Delaware and one of its subsidiaries (the “Merger”). The Merger was completed pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated April 27, 2016, the adoption of which was approved by Cardtronics Delaware’s shareholders on June 28, 2016 (collectively, the “Redomicile Transaction”). Pursuant to the Redomicile Transaction, each issued and outstanding common share of Cardtronics Delaware held immediately prior to the Merger was effectively converted into one Class A Ordinary Share, nominal value $0.01 per share, of Cardtronics plc (collectively, “common shares”). Upon completion, the common shares were listed and began trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC under the symbol “CATM,” the same symbol under which common shares of Cardtronics Delaware were formerly listed and traded. The Redomicile Transaction was accounted for as an internal reorganization of entities under common control, and therefore, Cardtronics Delaware’s assets and liabilities have been accounted for at their historical cost basis and not revalued in the transaction.
     A large portion of our growth throughout our operating history has been driven by acquisitions as we have expanded our operations in the U.S. and into several other new geographic markets in North America and Europe. Our largest markets are currently the U.S. and the U.K. On January 6, 2017, we completed the acquisition of DirectCash Payments Inc. (“DCPayments”), a publicly listed (Toronto Stock Exchange), leading operator of approximately 25,000 ATMs with primary operations in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., and Mexico. On January 31, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Spark ATM Systems (“Spark”), an independent ATM deployer in South Africa, with a growing network of approximately 2,300 ATMs as of the date of acquisition. 
     From 2001 to 2017, the total number of annual transactions processed within our network of ATMs increased from approximately 19.9 million to approximately 2.6 billion.

Information on our website is not incorporated into this 2017 Form 10-K or our other securities filings.     Our Strategy
     Our strategy is to leverage the expertise and scale we have built in our largest markets and to continue to expand in those markets. Additionally, we seek to grow in our other markets and expand into new international markets over time in order to enhance our position as a leading global provider of automated consumer financial services. We plan to drive additional transactions at our existing ATMs by making them increasingly attractive to banks and their customers to use. We also plan to continue partnering with leading financial institutions and retailers to expand our network of conveniently located ATMs. We also intend to expand our capabilities and service offerings to financial institutions, particularly in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, and Australia where we have established businesses and where we are seeing increasing demand from financial institutions for outsourcing of ATM-related services, including, in some cases, management of in-branch ATMs. Additional demand for our products and services in these markets is being driven by banks reducing the number of physical branches they operate and bank initiatives to lower their operating and capital costs. Additionally, we seek to deploy additional products and services that will further incentivize consumers to utilize our network of ATMs. In the future, we may seek to diversify our revenues beyond services provided by our ATMs. In order to execute our strategy, we endeavor to:
     Increase our number of deployed ATMs with existing and new merchant relationships. Certain of our retail customers continue to expand the number of active store locations they operate, either through acquisitions or through new store openings, thus providing us with additional ATM deployment opportunities. Additionally, we seek opportunities to deploy ATMs with new retailers, including retailers that currently do not have ATMs, as well as those that have existing ATM programs, but that are looking for a new ATM provider. We believe our expertise, broad geographic footprint, strong record of customer service, and significant scale positions us to successfully market to and enter into long-term contracts with additional leading merchants.
     Expand our relationships with leading financial institutions. Through our merchant relationships as well as our diverse product and service offerings, we believe we can provide our existing financial institution customers with convenient solutions to fulfill their growing ATM and automated consumer financial services requirements. Further, we believe we can leverage our product offerings to attract additional financial institutions as customers. Services currently offered to financial institutions include branding our ATMs with their logos, on-screen advertising and content management, providing image remote deposit capture, providing surcharge-free access to their cardholders, and providing managed services for their ATM portfolios. Our EFT transaction processing platforms enable us to provide customized control over the content of the information appearing on the screens of our ATMs and ATMs we process for financial institutions, which increases the types of products and services we are able to offer to financial institutions. We also plan to continue growing the number of ATMs and financial institutions participating in our Allpoint network, which drives higher transaction counts and profitability on our existing ATMs and increases our value to the retailers where our ATMs are located through increased foot traffic at their stores. As discussed above, we are seeing increasing demand from financial institutions for outsourcing of ATM-related services, as recent industry trends have caused banks to want to reduce their physical footprints and transform their existing branches to focus less on human tellers and increasingly utilize automation, 

 
  6

 
through ATMs and other digital channels, for serving their customers. While outsourcing of ATM-related services for financial institutions is not a significant driver of our revenues today, we believe we currently possess the capabilities to deliver value to financial institutions and plan to dedicate additional resources to drive growth in this area.
     Work with non-traditional financial institutions and card issuers to further leverage our extensive ATM network. We believe there are opportunities to develop or expand relationships with non-traditional financial institutions and card issuers, such as reloadable stored-value debit card issuers and alternative payment networks, which are seeking an extensive and convenient ATM network to complement their card offerings and electronic-based accounts. Additionally, we believe that many of the stored-value debit card issuers in the U.S. can benefit by providing their cardholders with access to our ATM network on a discounted or fee-free basis. For example, through our Allpoint network, we have sold access to our ATM network to issuers of stored-value debit cards to provide their cardholders with convenient, surcharge-free access to cash.
     Increase transaction levels at our existing locations. We believe there are opportunities to increase the number of transactions that are occurring today at our existing ATM locations. On average, only a small fraction of the individuals that enter our retail customers’ locations utilize our ATMs. In addition to our existing initiatives that tend to drive additional transaction volumes to our ATMs, such as bank-branding and network-branding, we have developed and are continuing to develop new initiatives to drive incremental transactions to our existing ATM locations. We also operate and continue to develop programs to steer cardholders of our existing financial institution partners and members of our Allpoint network to visit our ATMs in convenient retail locations. These programs may include incentives to cardholders such as coupons and rewards that influence customers to visit our ATMs within our existing retail footprint. While we are in various stages of developing and implementing many of these programs, we believe that these programs, when properly structured, can benefit multiple constituents (i.e., retailers, financial institutions, and cardholders) in addition to driving increased transaction volumes to our ATMs. 
     Develop and provide additional services at our existing ATMs. The majority of our ATMs in service currently offer only cash dispensing and other simple transactions such as balance inquiries. We believe that there are opportunities to offer additional automated consumer financial services at our ATMs, such as cash and check deposit, and other products which could provide a compelling and cost-effective solution for financial institutions and stored-value debit card issuers looking to provide convenient and broader financial services to their customers at well-known retail locations. We also allow advertisers to place their messages on our ATMs equipped with on-screen advertising software in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Offering additional services at our ATMs, such as advertising, allows us to create new revenue streams from assets that have already been deployed, in addition to providing value to our customers through beneficial offers and convenient services. We plan to develop additional products and services that can be delivered through our existing ATM network.
     Pursue additional managed services opportunities. Over the last several years, we expanded the number of ATMs that are operated under managed services arrangements. Under these arrangements, retailers and financial institutions generally pay us a fixed management fee per ATM and/or a fixed fee per transaction in exchange for handling some or all of the operational aspects associated with operating and maintaining their own ATMs. Surcharge and interchange fees under these arrangements are generally earned by the retailer or the financial institution rather than by us. As a result, in this arrangement type, our revenues are partially protected from fluctuations in transaction levels of these ATMs and changes in network interchange rates. We plan to continue pursuing additional managed services opportunities with leading merchants and financial institutions in the markets in which we operate.
     For additional information related to items that may impact our strategy, see Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Developing Trends and Recent Events.
     Our Products and Services
     Under our Company-owned arrangement type, we typically provide all of the services required to operate ATMs, which include monitoring, maintenance, cash management, customer service, and transaction processing. We believe our merchant and financial institution customers value our high level of service, industry expertise, and established operating history. In connection with the operation of our ATMs under our traditional ATM services model, we earn revenue on a 

 
  7

 
per transaction basis from the surcharge fees charged to cardholders for the convenience of using our ATMs and from interchange fees charged to cardholders’ financial institutions for processing the transactions conducted on our ATMs. As further described below, we also earn revenues on these ATMs based on our relationships with certain financial institutions and from our Allpoint network.
     Under our merchant-owned arrangement type, we typically provide transaction processing services, certain customer support functions, and settlement services. We generally earn interchange revenue on a per transaction basis in this arrangement. In some cases, the surcharge is earned completely by the merchant, in which case our revenues are derived solely from interchange revenues. In other arrangements, we also share a portion of the surcharge revenues.
     For ATMs under managed services arrangements (including transaction processing arrangements), we typically receive a fixed monthly management fee and/or fixed fee per transaction in return for providing the agreed-upon service or suite of services. We do not generally receive surcharge and interchange fees in these arrangements, but rather those amounts are earned by our customer. 
     We also earn revenues from other services at our ATMs, such as dynamic currency conversion fees, on-screen advertising, and other transaction-based fees, across our various arrangement types.
     The following table summarizes the number of ATMs under our various arrangement types as of December 31, 2017:
    
 | ATM Operations 
 | Company - Owned | | Merchant - Owned | | Subtotal | Managed Services and Processing | | Total
Number of ATMs at period end | 81,542 | | | 14,997 | | 96,539 | | | 134,156 | | 230,695 | 
Percentage | 35.3 | % | | 6.5 | % | 41.8 | % | | 58.2 | % | 100.0 | %

      We have found that the primary factor affecting transaction volumes at a given ATM is its location. Therefore, our strategy in deploying ATMs, particularly those placed under Company-owned arrangements, is to identify and deploy ATMs at locations that provide high visibility and high retail transaction volume. Our experience has demonstrated that the following locations often meet these criteria: convenience stores, gas stations, grocery stores, drug stores, transportation hubs (e.g., airports and train stations), and other major regional and national retail outlets. We have entered into multi-year agreements with many well-known merchants, including Bi-Lo Holdings, LLC, Coles Supermarket Australia Pty Ltd.,  CST Brands a division of Alimentation Couche-Tard (“Corner Store”), Cumberland Farms, Inc., CVS Caremark Corporation (“CVS”), HEB Grocery Company, L.P., The Kroger Co., The Pantry, Inc. (“Pantry”), Rite Aid Corporation, Safeway, Inc., Speedway LLC (“Speedway”), Sunoco, Inc., Target Corporation, and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (“Walgreens”) in the U.S.; Bank of Ireland Group, BP p.l.c., BT Group plc, Co-operative Food (“Co-op Food”), Martin McColl Ltd., Network Rail Infrastructure Limited, Royal Dutch Shell plc, Southern Railway Ltd., Tates Ltd., Waitrose Ltd., and Welcome Break Holdings Ltd. in the U.K.; Cadena Comercial OXXO S.A. de C.V. in Mexico; and 7-Eleven, Inc. (“7-Eleven”) in Canada and Australia. 
     We generally operate our ATMs under multi-year contracts that provide a recurring and stable source of revenue and typically have an initial term of five to seven years. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our contracts with our top five merchant customers (7-Eleven, Walgreens, CVS, Co-op Food (in the U.K.), and Speedway) accounted for approximately 30.9% of our total revenues, inclusive of our 7-Eleven relationship in the U.S. which accounted for 12.5% of our total revenues. Excluding 7-Eleven in the U.S., which we expect to account for less than 1% of our total revenues in 2018, the next top four contracts accounted for approximately 18.4% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017, and had a weighted average remaining life of approximately 3.8 years. As further discussed in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Developing Trends and Recent Events, we began to remove our ATMs from 7-Eleven U.S. locations during 2017, and all of our ATMs at 7-Eleven U.S. locations are expected to be removed during the first few months of 2018. As a result, our revenues are expected to decline in 2018 from what we reported in 2017. For additional information related to the risks associated with our customer mix, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from ATMs placed with a small number of merchants. The expiration, termination or renegotiation of any of these contracts with our top merchants, or if one or more of our top 

 
  8

 
merchants were to cease doing business with us, or substantially reduce its dealings with us, could cause our revenues to decline significantly and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.
     Additionally, we enter into arrangements with financial institutions to brand selected Company-owned ATMs with their logos. These bank-branding arrangements allow a financial institution to expand its geographic presence for less than the cost of building a branch location or placing one of its own ATMs at that location and rapidly increase its number of bank-branded ATM sites and improve its competitive position. Under these arrangements, the financial institution’s customers have access to use the bank-branded ATMs without paying a surcharge fee to us. In return, we receive a fixed management fee per ATM from the financial institution, while retaining our standard fee schedule for other cardholders using the bank-branded ATMs. In addition, our bank-branded ATMs typically earn higher interchange revenue as a result of the increased usage of our ATMs by the branding financial institution’s customers and others who prefer to use a bank-branded ATM. In some instances, we have branded an ATM with more than one financial institution. We intend to continue pursuing additional bank-branding arrangements as part of our growth strategy. 
     In addition to our bank-branding arrangements, we offer financial institutions another type of surcharge-free solution to their cardholders through our Allpoint surcharge-free ATM network. Under the Allpoint network, participating financial institutions pay us either a fixed monthly fee per cardholder or a fixed fee per transaction in exchange for us providing their cardholders with surcharge-free ATM access to approximately 55,000 participating ATMs in our Allpoint network, which includes ATMs throughout the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia, Puerto Rico, and Mexico. We believe our Allpoint network offers an attractive alternative for financial institutions that lack their own extensive and convenient ATM network, including the issuers of stored-value debit cards. 
     For additional information related to the amount of revenue contributed by our various service offerings, see Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Components of Revenues, Costs of Revenues, and Expenses - Revenues.
     Segment and Geographic Information
     As of December 31, 2017, we operate in three segments: North America, Europe & Africa, and Australia & New Zealand. Our North America segment includes ATM operations in all 50 states in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, and Mexico, and accounted for 64.4% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our Europe & Africa segment includes our ATM operations in the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Poland, Spain, and South Africa, and accounted for 26.8% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our Australia & New Zealand segment includes Australia and New Zealand and accounted for 8.8% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. While each of the reporting segments provides similar kiosk-based and/or ATM-related services, each segment is managed separately and requires different marketing and business strategies.
     As the integration of DCPayments (acquired in January 2017) progressed throughout the second quarter of 2017, the Company separated the DCPayments operations into their respective geographical components, including them within the Company’s geographical segments and reorganized its segments into North America, Europe & Africa, and Australia & New Zealand. The North America segment includes the Company’s transaction processing operations, which service its internal ATM operations, along with external customers. The transaction processing operations were previously reported in the Company’s Corporate & Other segment. Segment information presented for prior periods has been revised to reflect the changes in the Company’s segments.
     For financial information including revenues, earnings, and total assets of our reporting segments, see Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 20. Segment Information. For additional information related to the risks associated with our international operations, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - We operate in many sovereign jurisdictions across the globe and expect to continue to grow our business in new regions. Operating in different countries involves special risks and our geographic expansion may not be successful, which would result in a reduction of our gross and net profits.

 Sales and Marketing
     In the U.S., our sales and marketing teams are organized by customer type across retail and financial industries. We have teams focused on developing new relationships with national, regional, and local merchants as well as building and maintaining relationships with our existing merchants and ATM distributors. In addition, we have sales and marketing teams focused on developing and managing our bank-branding and Allpoint relationships with financial institutions and stored-value debit card issuers, as we look to expand the types of services that we offer to such institutions. Our sales and marketing teams also focus on identifying potential managed services opportunities with financial institutions and retailers alike. Additionally, we maintain sales teams in each of the other geographic markets in which we currently operate.
     In addition to targeting new business opportunities, our sales and marketing teams support our customer retention and growth initiatives by building and maintaining relationships with our established and recently-acquired merchants. We seek to identify growth opportunities within merchant accounts by analyzing ATM cardholder patterns. We also analyze foot traffic and various demographic data to determine the best opportunities for new ATM placements, as well as the potential drivers for increasing same-store ATM transactions that will positively impact merchant store sales. Employees who focus on sales are typically compensated with a combination of incentive-based compensation and base salary.
     Technology and Operations
     Our technology and operations platforms consist of ATMs, central transaction processing systems, network infrastructure components (including hardware, software, and telecommunication circuits used to provide real-time ATM monitoring, software distribution, and transaction processing services), cash management and forecasting software tools, customer service, and ATM management infrastructure. 
     Equipment. We purchase our ATMs from global manufacturers, including, but not limited to, NCR Corporation (“NCR”), Nautilus Hyosung, Inc. (“Hyosung”), Diebold Incorporated (“Diebold”), Triton Systems (“Triton”), and Chungho ComNet (“Chungho”) and place them in our customers’ locations. The wide range of advanced technology available from these ATM manufacturers provides our customers with advanced features and reliability through sophisticated diagnostics and self-testing routines. 
     Transaction processing. We place significant emphasis on providing quality service with a high level of security and minimal interruption. We have carefully selected support vendors and systems, as well as developed internal professional staff to optimize the performance of our network. Since 2006, we have operated our own EFT transaction processing platforms, which were further expanded with our acquisition of Columbus Data Services, L.L.C. (“CDS”) in 2015. EFT transaction processing enables us to process and monitor transactions on our ATMs and to control the flow and content of information appearing on the screens of such ATMs. We have also implemented new products and services such as foreign currency exchange services, such as dynamic currency conversion, and have introduced targeted marketing campaigns through on-screen advertising. 
     Internal systems. Our internal systems, including our EFT transaction processing platforms, include multiple layers of security to help protect the systems from unauthorized access. We use hardware- and software- based security features to prevent and report unauthorized access attempts to our systems. We employ user authentication and security measures at multiple levels. These systems are protected by detailed security rules to only allow appropriate access to information based on the employee’s job responsibilities. Changes to systems are controlled by policies and procedures, with automatic prevention and reporting controls that are placed within our processes. Our real-time connections to the various financial institutions’ authorization systems that allow withdrawals, balance inquiries, transfers, and advanced functionality transactions are accomplished through gateway relationships or direct connections. We use commercially-available and proprietary software that monitors the performance of the ATMs in our network, including details of transactions at each ATM and expenses relating to the ATMs, further allowing us to monitor our on-line availability and financial profitability at each location. We analyze transaction volume and profitability data to determine whether to continue operating at a given site, to determine how to price various operating arrangements with merchants and bank-branding partners, and to create a profile of successful locations to assist us in deciding the best locations for additional deployments. 
     Product development. In recent years we have made investments to develop new technology which we anticipate will drive transaction volume at our ATMs. In March 2013, we acquired i-design, a Scotland-based company providing technology and marketing services for ATM operators to enable custom screens, graphical receipt content, and advertising 

 
  10

 
and marketing data capture on the ATM. We expect to continue to grow and leverage the products and services of this business within our own network of ATMs and with select external parties. Additionally, we have a product development team focused on improving existing products and services as well as delivering new capabilities that generally leverage our existing platform. Internal product development is an increasing focus for the company, and we expect over time, our product development will drive revenue growth. Examples of recent and continued product development include dynamic currency conversion at the ATM, promotional consumer offers, and the ability to convert stored value digital currency into cash at the ATM. A number of products are currently in various stages of development, pilot, and rollout.
     ATM cash management. Our ATM cash management function uses commercially-available software and proprietary analytical models to determine the necessary fill frequency and cash load amount for each ATM. We project vault cash requirements for our Company-owned and cash-serviced ATMs, taking into consideration its location, the day of the week, the timing of holidays, and other factors such as specific events occurring in the vicinity of the ATM. After receiving a cash order from us, the vault cash provider forwards the request to its vault location nearest to the applicable ATM. Personnel at the vault location then arrange for the requested amount of cash to be set aside and made available for the designated armored courier to access and subsequently transport to the ATM. Our ATM cash management department utilizes data from the vault cash providers, internally-produced data, and a proprietary methodology to confirm daily orders, audit delivery of cash to armored couriers and ATMs, monitor cash balances for cash shortages, coordinate and manage emergency cash orders, and audit costs from both armored couriers and vault cash providers. 
     In the U.K., we operate our own armored courier operation which we significantly expanded through the acquisition of Sunwin Services Group (“Sunwin”) in November 2014. As of December 31, 2017, this operation was servicing approximately 14,900 of our ATMs in the U.K. 
     Customer service. We believe one of the factors that differentiates us from our competitors is our customer service responsiveness and proactive approach to managing any downtime experienced by our ATMs. We use an advanced software and skilled technicians that monitor our ATMs 24 hours a day for service interruptions and notify our maintenance engineers and vendors for prompt dispatch of necessary service calls. 
     Finally, we use proprietary software systems to maintain a database of transactions and performance metrics for our ATMs. This data is aggregated into individual merchant and financial institution customer profiles that are accessible by our customer service representatives and managers. We believe our proprietary databases enable us to provide superior quality and reliable customer support, together with information on trends that is valuable to our retail and financial institution partners.
     Primary Vendor Relationships 
     To maintain an efficient and flexible operating structure, we outsource certain aspects of our operations, including cash supply and cash delivery, maintenance, and certain transaction processing services. Due to the large number of ATMs we operate, we believe we have obtained favorable pricing terms from most of our major vendors. We contract for the provision of the services described below in connection with our operations.
     Transaction processing. We own and operate EFT transaction processing platforms that utilize proprietary as well as commercially-available software. Historically, our processing efforts have been primarily focused on controlling the flow and content of information on the ATM screen, and we have largely relied on third-party service providers to handle our connections to the EFT networks and to perform certain funds settlement and reconciliation procedures on our behalf. The third-party transaction processors communicate with the cardholder’s financial institution through various EFT networks in order to obtain transaction authorizations and to provide us with the information we need to ensure that the related funds are properly settled. In addition, we have developed a capability to connect to major financial institutions and certain networks on a direct or virtually-direct basis, and we expanded this direct model with our CDS acquisition in 2015. As a result of our past acquisitions, a portion of our withdrawal transactions are currently processed through other third-party processors, with whom the acquired businesses had existing contractual relationships. We plan to convert transaction processing services to our internal EFT transaction processing platforms when economically advantageous to us or as these contracts expire or are terminated.

 EFT network services. Our transactions are routed over various EFT networks to obtain authorization for cash disbursements and to provide account balances. EFT networks set the interchange fees that they charge to the financial institutions, as well as the amount paid to us. We attempt to maximize the utility of our ATMs to cardholders by participating in as many EFT networks as practical. Additionally, we own and operate the Allpoint network, the largest surcharge-free network in the U.S. Having this network further enhances our ATM utility by providing certain cardholders surcharge-free access to our ATMs, as well as allowing us to receive network-related economic benefits such as receiving additional transaction-based revenue and setting interchange rates on transactions over this network.
     Equipment. We purchase substantially all of our ATMs from a number of global ATM manufacturers, including, but not limited to, NCR, Hyosung, Triton, Diebold, and Chungho. The large quantity of ATMs that we purchase from these manufacturers enables us to receive favorable pricing and terms. In addition, we maintain close working relationships with these manufacturers in the course of our business, allowing us to stay informed about product updates and to receive prompt attention for any technical problems with purchased ATM equipment. The favorable pricing we receive from these manufacturers also allows us to offer certain of our customers an affordable solution to replace their ATMs to be compliant with new regulatory requirements as they arise. 
     Maintenance. In the U.S., we generally contract with third-party service providers for on-site maintenance services in most of our markets. In the U.K., maintenance services are mostly performed by our in-house technicians. 
     ATM cash management. We obtain cash to fill our Company-owned ATMs, and in some cases merchant-owned and managed services ATMs, under arrangements with various vault cash providers. We pay a monthly fee based on the average outstanding vault cash balances to our primary vault cash providers under a floating rate formula, which is generally based on various benchmark interest rates such as London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”). In virtually all cases, beneficial ownership of the cash is retained by the vault cash providers, and we have no right to the cash and no access except for the ATMs that are serviced by our wholly-owned armored courier operations in the U.K. While our U.K. armored courier operations have physical access to the cash loaded in the ATMs, beneficial ownership of that cash remains with the vault cash provider at all times. We also contract with third-parties to provide us with certain cash management services, which varies by geography, which may include reporting, armored courier coordination, cash ordering, cash insurance, reconciliation of ATM cash balances, and claims processing with armored couriers, financial institutions, and processors.
     For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we had an average outstanding vault cash balance of approximately $2.3 billion in cash in our North America ATMs under arrangements with Bank of America, N.A. (“Bank of America”), Wells Fargo, N.A. (“Wells Fargo”), Elan Financial Services (“Elan”) (a division of U.S. Bancorp), and Capital One Financial Corp. (“Capital One”). In Europe & Africa, the average outstanding vault cash balance was approximately $1.4 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, which was primarily supplied by Santander, Royal Bank of Scotland (“RBS”), HSBC Holdings plc (“HSBC”), and Barclays PLC (“Barclays”). In Australia & New Zealand, the average outstanding vault cash balance for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was approximately $250 million, which was primarily supplied by National Australia Bank Limited (“NAB”) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (“ANZ”). For additional information related to our vault cash agreements and the related risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - We rely on third-parties to provide us with the cash we require to operate many of our ATMs. If these third-parties were unable or unwilling to provide us with the necessary cash to operate our ATMs, we would need to locate alternative sources of cash to operate our ATMs or we would not be able to operate our business.
     The vault cash that we are contractually responsible for in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate is insured up to certain per location loss limits and subject to per incident and annual aggregate deductibles through a syndicate of multiple underwriters.
     Cash replenishment. We contract with armored courier services to transport and transfer most of the cash to our ATMs. We use leading third-party armored couriers in all of our jurisdictions except for in the U.K., where we primarily utilize our own armored courier operations. Under these arrangements, the armored couriers pick up the cash in bulk, and using instructions received from us and our vault cash providers, prepare the cash for delivery to each ATM on the designated fill day. Following a predetermined schedule, the armored couriers visit each location on the designated fill day, load cash into each ATM, and then balance each machine and provide cash reporting to the applicable vault cash provider.

     Merchant Customers
     In each of our markets, we typically deploy our Company-owned ATMs under long-term contracts with major national and regional merchants, including convenience stores, gas stations, grocery stores, drug stores, and other high-traffic locations. Our merchant-owned ATMs are typically deployed under arrangements with smaller independent merchants. 
     The terms of our merchant contracts vary as a result of negotiations at the time of execution. In the case of Company-owned ATMs, the contract terms vary, but typically include the following:
    
· | a multi-year term, typically five to seven years;
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | exclusive deployment of ATMs at locations where we install an ATM;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the right to increase surcharge fees, with merchant consent required in some cases;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | in the U.S., our right to terminate or remove ATMs or renegotiate the fees payable to the merchant if surcharge fees or interchange fees are reduced or eliminated as a result of regulatory action; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | provisions that make the merchant’s fee dependent on the number of ATM transactions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      During the year ended December 31, 2017, we derived approximately 30.9% of our total revenues from ATMs placed at the locations of our top five merchant customers. 7-Eleven in the U.S. is currently the largest merchant customer in our portfolio, representing approximately 12.5% of our total revenues for the year. The next four largest merchant customers together comprised approximately 18.4% of our total revenues for the year. The 7-Eleven ATM placement agreement in the U.S. expired in July 2017, and most of the ATM operations have been transitioned to the new service provider as of December 31, 2017. After 7-Eleven, our next four largest merchant customers were Co-op Food (in the U.K.), Walgreens, CVS, and Speedway, none of which individually contributed more than 6% of our total revenues for the year. The weighted average remaining life of the four largest merchant customers (excluding 7-Eleven in the U.S.) is approximately 3.8 years. For additional information related to the risks associated with our customer mix, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from ATMs placed with a small number of merchants. The expiration, termination or renegotiation of any of these contracts with our top merchants, or if one or more of our top merchants were to cease doing business with us, or substantially reduce its dealings with us, could cause our revenues to decline significantly and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.
     Seasonality
     Our overall business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with generally fewer transactions occurring in the first quarter of the year. Transaction volumes at our ATMs located in regions affected by strong winter weather patterns typically experience declines in volume during winter months as a result of decreases in the amount of consumer traffic through such locations. We usually see an increase in transactions in the warmer summer months, which are also aided by increased vacation and holiday travel. We expect these fluctuations in transaction volumes to continue in the future.      Competition 
     Historically, we have competed with financial institutions and other independent ATM deployers (commonly referred to as “IADs”) for ATM placements, new merchant accounts, bank-branding, and acquisitions. IADs compete with us for placement rights at merchant locations. Our ATMs compete with the ATMs owned and operated by financial institutions and other IADs for underlying consumer transactions. In certain locations with very high foot traffic, such as airports or major train stations, large arenas or stadiums, we often see competition from large financial institutions as they may utilize such locations for marketing and advertising purposes, and in some cases are willing to subsidize the operations of the ATM. Recently, we have seen somewhat less competition from financial institutions seeking to place ATMs directly at merchant locations.
     We have established relationships with leading national and regional financial institutions through our bank-branding program and our Allpoint network. Both of these programs can be cost-efficient alternatives to financial institutions in lieu of operating branches and owning and operating extensive ATM networks. We believe the scale of our extensive network,

our EFT transaction processing services, and our focus on customer service provide us with competitive advantages for providing services to leading financial institutions. 
     Through our Allpoint surcharge-free network, we have significantly expanded our relationships with local, regional, and national financial institutions as well as large issuers of stored-value debit card programs. With regard to our Allpoint network, we encounter competition from other organizations’ surcharge-free networks that are seeking to sell their network to retail locations and offer surcharge-free ATM access to issuers of stored-value debit cards, as well as financial institutions that lack large ATM footprints. 
     We work to continually develop the types of services we provide to financial institutions and merchants, including management of their ATMs. With respect to our managed services offering, we believe we are well-positioned to offer a comprehensive ATM outsourcing solution with our breadth of services, in-house expertise, and network of existing locations that can leverage the economies of scale required to operate an ATM portfolio. There are several large financial services companies, ATM equipment manufacturers, and service providers that currently offer some of the services we provide, with whom we expect to compete directly in this area. In spite of this, we believe that we have unique advantages that will allow us to offer a compelling solution to financial institutions and retailers alike. 
     We have also historically competed for acquisition opportunities in each of the markets in which we operate. Acquisitions have been a consistent part of our strategy and may form part of our strategy in the future. Typically, competition for acquisitions is from other IADs, financial service or payments businesses, and/or private equity sponsors of ATM portfolios.
     Finally, we face indirect competition from alternative payment mechanisms, such as card-based payments or other electronic forms of payment, including payment applications on mobile phones. While it has been difficult to specifically quantify the direct effects from alternative payment sources on our transaction volumes, cash-based payments have declined as a percentage of total payments in our primary geographic markets in recent years. Further expansion in electronic payment forms and the entry of new and less traditional competitors could reduce demand for cash at merchant locations. We expect to continue to face competition from emerging payments technology in the future. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - The proliferation of payment options other than cash, including credit cards, debit cards, stored-value debit cards, and mobile payments options could result in a reduced need for cash in the marketplace and a resulting decline in the usage of our ATMs.
     Government and Industry Regulation
     Our principal business, ATM network ownership and operation, is subject to government (federal, state, or local) and industry regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide our products and services in such jurisdictions, as well as the imposition of civil fines. For additional information related to recent regulatory matters that have impacted our operations or are expected to impact us in the future, see Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Developing Trends and Recent Events. Risk Management
     We have adopted a formalized Enterprise Risk Management program that seeks to identify and manage the major risks we face. The major risks are prioritized and assigned to a member of the management team who develops mitigation plans, monitors the risk activity, and is responsible for implementation of the mitigation plan, if necessary. The risks, plans, and activities are monitored by our management team and Board of Directors on a regular basis.Employees
     As of December 31, 2017, we had 2,271 employees, 130 of which were represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We currently believe our relationships with employees represented by unions are good, and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
