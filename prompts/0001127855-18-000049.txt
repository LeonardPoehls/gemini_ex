Item 1.  Business
 
Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K Advantego Corporation is referred to as "we," "our," "us," the "Company," or "Advantego."
 
The Company was formed as a Colorado corporation on July 21, 1988 as Beneficial Capital Financial Services Corp.  On February 2, 1995, the Company changed its name to Golden Eagle International, Inc. ("GEII").
 
In 2004, the Company purchased the 3,500 to 4,500 ton-per-day Gold Bar mill which is located 25 miles northwest of Eureka, Nevada.  Initially, the Company's plan was to disassemble the mill and transport it to Bolivia to be reconstructed on mineral properties formally owned by the Company.  However, due to the costs associated with disassembling and transporting the mill to Bolivia, the Company determined that the best course of action was to leave the mill in place and explore other options, such as processing ore for third parties which had mines in the area, or selling the mill.
 
Having been unsuccessful in selling the mill, or processing ore for third parties, the Company concluded the mill would not provide any meaningful value to the Company's shareholders.  Accordingly, on October 30, 2015, the Company agreed to sell the mill to Gulf Coast Capital, LLC, an entity controlled by Mark Bogani, a former officer and director of the Company, in consideration for Gulf Coast assuming all of the Company's liabilities.  On July 20, 2016, the agreement relating to the sale of the Gold Bar Mill was terminated by the mutual consent of the Company and Gulf Coast Capital.
 
The mill was not in operation when the Company acquired it, and it has not been in operation since it was acquired by the Company.
 
On October 27, 2016, the Company acquired 100% stock ownership of Advantego Technologies, Inc. in exchange for 11,628,636 (post-split) shares of the Company's common stock. The stock exchange is deemed a reverse merger, as the management and operations of Advantego have continued, and Advantego's management received in the aggregate a majority ownership in GEII as a result of the stock exchange. Concurrent with the merger, the combined entity executed a quasi-reorganization, thereby eliminating Golden Eagle's losses accumulated since its inception through the date of the merger.
 
In connection with this acquisition, the following management changes took place on October 28, 2016:
 
 
● | Mark Bogani resigned as an officer and director of the Company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Frank Grey resigned as the Company's Secretary and Treasurer;

● | Tracy Madsen resigned as a director of the Company;

● | Robert Ferguson became a director of the Company and the Company's Chief Executive Officer;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fred Popke became a director of the Company and the Company's Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | John J. Carvelli and Barry Adnams became directors of the Company.

On December 30, 2016, the Company transferred the Gold Bar Mill and its associated liabilities - consisting of severance pay notes payable plus accrued interest owed to former officers and directors Terry Turner and Tracy Madsen - to its then wholly-owned subsidiary, Quove Corporation, which the Company formed on October 31, 2016.  On December 30, 2016, the Company transferred the shares of the subsidiary to a trust owned and controlled by a minority shareholder of the Company, thereby divesting all of its ownership of and affiliation with Quove Corporation.  When permitted by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Quove shares will be distributed from the trust account to GEII's shareholders who owned eleven or more shares of the then GEII's common stock at the close of business on October 27, 2016.
 
On January 31, 2018 the Company changed its name to Advantego Corporation and amended Golden Eagle International, Inc.'s Articles of Incorporation accordingly.  On February 22, 2018, a 1-for-11 reverse stock split, which was approved by the Company's shareholders on January 31, 2018, became effective on the OTCQB Market. Unless otherwise indicated, all per share information in this report has been adjusted to reflect this reverse stock split.
