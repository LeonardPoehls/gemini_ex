ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
 
General Development of the Business
 
In this 10-K, “we”, “us”, “our”, “MREIC” or “the Company”, refers to Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation, together with its predecessors and subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.
 
We are a corporation that qualifies as a real estate investment trust (REIT) under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). Our investment focus is to own well-located, modern, single tenant, industrial buildings, leased primarily to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries on long-term net leases. We were founded in 1968 and are one of the oldest public equity REITs in the world. We intend to maintain our qualification as a REIT in the future. As a REIT, with limited exceptions, we will not be taxed under Federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders. For special tax provisions applicable to REITs, refer to Sections 856-860 of the Code. We are subject to franchise taxes in several of the states in which we own properties.
 
In December 2017, as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA), Code Section 199A, was added to the Code and became effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Under the TCJA, subject to certain income limitations, an individual taxpayer and estates and trusts may deduct 20% of the aggregate amount of qualified REIT dividends they receive from their taxable income. Qualified REIT dividends do not include any portion of a dividend received from a REIT that is classified as a capital gain dividend or qualified dividend income.
 
We were established in 1968 as a New Jersey Business Trust (NJBT). In 1990, the NJBT merged into a newly formed Delaware corporation. On May 15, 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from Delaware to Maryland by merging with and into a Maryland corporation.
 
Narrative Description of Business
 
Our primary business is the ownership of real estate. Our investment focus is to own well-located, modern, single tenant, industrial buildings, leased primarily to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries on long-term net leases. In addition, we own a portfolio of REIT investment securities which we generally limit to no more than approximately 10% of our undepreciated assets (which is our total assets excluding accumulated depreciation).
 
As of September 30, 2018, we had 14 full-time employees and one part-time employee.
 
At September 30, 2018, we held investments in 111 properties totaling approximately 21,174,000 square feet with an occupancy rate of 99.6% (See Item 2 for a detailed description of the properties). These properties are located in 30 states: Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. All of these properties are wholly-owned with the exception of the two properties in New Jersey in which we own a majority interest. All properties which we have investments are leased on a net basis except an industrial park in Monaca (Pittsburgh), Pennsylvania and the shopping center located in Somerset, New Jersey.
 
During fiscal 2018, we purchased seven industrial properties totaling approximately 2,655,000 square feet with net-leased terms ranging from 10 to 15 years resulting in a weighted average lease maturity of 11.4 years. Approximately 2,255,000 square feet, or 85% of the properties purchased, are leased to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries, of which, approximately 761,000 square feet, or 29%, is leased to FedEx Corporation (FDX) or FedEx Ground Package System, Inc., a subsidiary of FDX. The aggregate purchase price for the seven properties was approximately $282,332,000. These properties are located in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Oklahoma and South Carolina. These seven properties generate annualized rental income over the life of their leases of approximately $17,414,000. In connection with the seven properties acquired during the 2018 fiscal year, we entered into four 15 year fully-amortizing mortgage loans, two 14 year fully-amortizing mortgage loans and one 10 year loan amortizing over 18 years. The seven mortgage loans originally totaled $175,160,000 with an original weighted average mortgage loan maturity of 14.1 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.91%.

On October 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.17 per share, to be paid on December 17, 2018, to common shareholders of record at the close of business on November 15, 2018, which represents an annualized common dividend rate of $0.68 per share. We intend to pay these distributions from cash flows from operations.
 
We have maintained or increased our common stock cash dividend for 27 consecutive years. On October 1, 2015, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend from $0.15 per share to $0.16 per share representing a 6.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend. Then again, most recently, on October 2, 2017, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend and from $0.16 per share to $0.17 per share on October 2, 2017, representing a 6.3% increase in our quarterly cash dividend. These two dividend raises represent a total increase of 13%.
 
Our common stock dividend policy is dependent upon our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, availability and cost of bank financing and other factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors. It is our intention to continue making comparable quarterly distributions in the future and to grow our distributions over time.
 
Subsequent to fiscal yearend, on October 19, 2018, we purchased a newly constructed 347,145 square foot industrial building, situated on 62.0 acres, located in Trenton, NJ. The building is 100% net-leased to FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. for 15 years through June 2032. The purchase price was $85,248,352. We obtained a 15 year, fully-amortizing mortgage loan of $55,000,000 at a fixed interest rate of 4.13%. Annual rental revenue over the remaining term of the lease averages approximately $5,328,000.
 
The industrial property purchased thus far during fiscal 2019 increased our current total leasable square feet to approximately 21,521,000.
 
In addition to the property purchased subsequent to our fiscal yearend, as described above, we have entered into agreements to purchase two new build-to-suit, industrial buildings that are currently being developed in Georgia and North Carolina, consisting of approximately 398,000 square feet, with net-leased terms ranging from 10 to 15 years, with a weighted average lease term of 13.4 years.  The purchase price for these properties is approximately $68,747,000 and both are leased to FedEx Ground Package System, Inc.  Subject to satisfactory due diligence and other customary closing conditions and requirements, we anticipate closing these transactions during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020.  In connection with one of these properties, we have entered into a commitment to obtain a 15 year, fully-amortizing mortgage loan of $17,500,000 with a fixed interest rate of 4.40%. We currently have one 154,800 square foot property expansion in progress at our property located in Monroe, OH which is expected to be completed in fiscal year 2019 for a total project cost of approximately $9,072,000. The expansion will result in a new 15 year lease which will extend the prior lease expiration date from February 2030 to January 2034. In addition, the expansion will result in an increase in initial annual rent effective from the date of completion by approximately $862,000 from approximately $961,000 to approximately $1,823,000. In addition, the annual rent will increase 2% per annum. We may have additional acquisitions and expansions in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020, and the funds for these acquisitions may come from funds generated from operations, mortgages, draws on our unsecured line of credit facility, cash on hand, sale of marketable securities, other bank borrowings, proceeds from the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (DRIP), proceeds from the At-The-Market Preferred Equity Program (Preferred Stock ATM Program), and proceeds from private placements and public offerings of additional common or preferred stock or other securities. To the extent that funds or appropriate properties are not available, fewer acquisitions will be made.
 
Currently, we derive our income primarily from real estate rental operations. Rental and Reimbursement Revenue (excluding Lease Termination Income in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 of $210,261, $-0- and $-0-, respectively) was $139,161,849, $116,385,305 and $97,755,433 for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Total undepreciated assets (which is our total assets excluding accumulated depreciation) were $1,925,443,520 and $1,614,123,838 as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

As of September 30, 2018, we had approximately 21,174,000 square feet of property, of which approximately 10,083,000 square feet, or 48%, consisting of 60 separate stand-alone leases, were leased to FDX and its subsidiaries (7% to FDX and 41% to FDX subsidiaries). These properties are located in 24 different states. As of September 30, 2018, the 60 separate stand-alone leases that are leased to FDX and FDX subsidiaries had a weighted average lease maturity of 9.4 years. As of September 30, 2018, the only tenant that leased 5% or more of our total square footage was FDX (including its subsidiaries).
 
During fiscal 2018, the only tenant that accounted for 5% or more of our rental and reimbursement revenue was FDX (including its subsidiaries). Our rental and reimbursement revenue from FDX and its subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, totaled approximately $80,726,000, $68,151,000 and $52,793,000, or 58% (7% from FDX and 51% from FDX subsidiaries), 59% (7% from FDX and 52% from FDX subsidiaries) and 55% (9% from FDX and 46% from FDX subsidiaries), of total rent and reimbursement revenues.
 
FDX is a publicly-owned company and financial information related to this entity is available at the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov. FDX is rated “BBB” by S&P Global Ratings (www.standardandpoors.com) and is rated “Baa2” by Moody’s (www.moodys.com), which are both considered “Investment Grade” ratings. The references in this report to the SEC’s website, S&P Global Ratings’ website and Moody’s website are not intended to and do not include or incorporate by reference into this report the information of FDX, S&P Global Ratings or Moody’s on such websites.
 
In addition to real estate property holdings, we held $154,920,545 in marketable REIT securities at September 30, 2018, representing 8.0% of our undepreciated assets (which is our total assets excluding accumulated depreciation). These liquid real estate holdings are not included in calculating the tenant concentration ratios above and therefore further increase our diversification. The securities portfolio provides us with additional diversification, liquidity, and income, and serves as a proxy for real estate when more favorable risk adjusted returns are not available.
 
Our weighted-average lease expiration was 8.1 years and 7.9 years as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and our average annualized rent per occupied square foot as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 was $6.01 and $5.93, respectively. Our occupancy rate as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 was 99.6% and 99.3%, respectively.
 
We compete with other investors in real estate for attractive investment opportunities. These investors include other equity real estate investment trusts, limited partnerships, syndications and private investors, among others. Competition in the market areas in which we operate is significant and affects our ability to acquire or expand properties, occupancy levels, rental rates, and operating expenses of certain properties. We have built long-term relationships within our tenant base as well as within the merchant builder community. These relationships have historically provided us with investment opportunities that fit our investment policy. The amount of new construction of industrial properties on the national level has been increasing the past six years following several years of historically low levels of new supply. These levels of new supply, although increasing, continue to be below historical norms. Driven to a large extent by the continued growth in ecommerce sales, demand for industrial space remains very strong, driving national occupancy rates to an all-time high of 95% currently. For further discussion of potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see Item 1A: Risk Factors below.
 
Industrial space demand is very closely correlated to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. Despite nine years of unprecedented monetary stimulus, real annual GDP growth averaged less than 2.0% over this period. Economic growth has been strong this past year further increasing demand for industrial space. The most significant demand driver for modern industrial real estate continues to be ecommerce. Every year since the turn of the century, the percentage of goods purchased on-line has increased at an average 16% annual growth rate. Today, excluding food, fuel, and autos, approximately 19% of total retail sales have migrated from traditional store sales to on-line sales and we expect this growth in market share to continue. We expect these favorable trends for the industrial real estate sector to be a leading demand driver for the foreseeable future, as consumers continue to embrace the added efficiencies of on-line consumption. The strong financial position of our tenants, together with the long duration of our leases, provides for high quality, reliable income streams throughout the business cycle.

We continue to invest in marketable securities of other REITs, which we generally limit to no more than approximately 10% of our undepreciated assets (which is our total assets excluding accumulated depreciation). Our investments in equity securities of other REITs provide us with additional diversification, liquidity, and income, and serves as a proxy for real estate when more favorable risk adjusted returns are not available. From time to time, we may purchase these securities on margin when the interest and dividend yields exceed the cost of funds. In general, we may borrow up to 50% of the value of the marketable securities, which was $154,920,545 as of September 30, 2018. As of September 30, 2018, we had borrowings of $26,608,676 under our margin line, bearing interest at 2.75%. Subsequent to fiscal yearend, on October 9, 2018, we paid off the margin loan. As of September 30, 2017, we had borrowings of $10,091,417 under our margin line, bearing interest at 2.05%. The REIT securities portfolio provides us with additional income, and to the extent not pledged to secure borrowings, provides us with additional liquidity. Such securities are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, primarily market price risk relating to equity securities and interest rate risk relating to debt securities. From time to time, we may use derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate risk, however, this has not occurred during any periods presented. At September 30, 2018 and 2017, we had $154,920,545 and $123,764,770, respectively, of securities available for sale. The unrealized net gain (loss) on securities available for sale at September 30, 2018 and 2017 was $(24,744,579) and $6,570,565, respectively, resulting in a decrease for the fiscal year of $31,315,144. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our net realized gains from the sale of securities were $111,387, $2,311,714 and $4,398,599, respectively.
 
On June 29, 2017, we entered into a Preferred Stock At-The-Market Sales Agreement Program with B. Riley FBR, Inc., or B. Riley (formerly FBR Capital Markets & Co.), that provided for the offer and sale of shares of our 6.125% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, or our 6.125% Series C preferred stock, having an aggregate sales price of up to $100,000,000. On August 2, 2018, we replaced this program with a new Preferred Stock At-The-Market Sales Agreement Program (Preferred Stock ATM Program) with B. Riley that provides for the offer and sale from time to time of $125,000,000 of our 6.125% Series C preferred stock. We began selling shares through these programs on July 3, 2017. Since inception through September 30, 2018, we sold 3,088,001 shares under these programs at a weighted average price of $25.06 per share, and generated net proceeds, after offering expenses, of approximately $75,828,000, of which 1,648,556 shares were sold during the fiscal year ended 2018 at a weighted average price of $24.84 per share, and generated net proceeds, after offering expenses, of approximately $40,094,000. As of September 30, 2018, there is approximately $119,096,000 remaining that may be sold under the Preferred Stock ATM Program.
 
As of September 30, 2018, 11,488,001 shares of the 6.125% Series C Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding.
 
Subsequent to fiscal yearend, in October 2018, we completed a public offering of 9,200,000 shares of our Common Stock (including the underwriters’ option to purchase 1,200,000 additional shares) at a price of $15.00 per share, before underwriting discounts. We received net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and all other transaction costs, of approximately $132,339,000.
 
Investment and Other Policies
 
Our investment policy is to concentrate our investments in well-located, modern, single-tenant, industrial buildings, leased primarily to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries on long-term net leases. Our strategy is to obtain a favorable yield spread between the income from the net-leased industrial properties and interest costs. In addition, we believe that investments in well-located, modern industrial properties provide a potential for long-term capital appreciation. There is the risk that, upon expiration of leases, the properties will become vacant or will be re-leased at lower rents. The results obtained from re-leasing the properties will depend on the market for industrial properties at that time.

In fiscal 2018, approximately 8% of our gross leasable area, representing 16 leases totaling 1,546,637 square feet, was set to expire. We have renewed 11 of the 16 leases that were set to expire. One of the 11 leases, which is with FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. for a property located in Hanahan (Charleston), SC, renewed for only four months because the tenant moved its operations from our 91,776 square foot facility to a newly constructed, much larger, 265,318 square foot facility, which is also located in Charleston, SC. We purchased this new facility on August 15, 2018. Excluding this four month lease renewal, the ten leases that have renewed, represent 972,048 square feet, or 63% of the expiring square footage, and have a weighted average lease term of 6.8 years. These ten lease renewals result in a U.S. GAAP straight-line weighted average lease rate of $5.87 per square foot. The renewed weighted average initial cash rent per square foot also results in a weighted average lease rate of $5.87 per square foot. This represents an increase in the weighted average lease rate of 4.08% on a U.S. GAAP straight-line basis and an increase in the weighted average lease rate of 2.80% on a cash basis. Five of the sixteen leases, representing 482,813 square feet or 31% of the expiring square footage, did not renew. Three of these five buildings, representing 183,837 square feet or 12% of the expiring square footage, have been sold and one of the remaining five properties, representing 218,120 square or 14% of the expiring square footage, has been re-tenanted.
 
We seek to invest in well-located, modern, single tenant, industrial buildings, leased primarily to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries on long-term net leases. In management’s opinion, the recently acquired facilities meet these criteria. We have a concentration of properties leased to FDX and FDX subsidiaries. This is a risk that shareholders should consider. FDX is a publicly-owned company and financial information related to this entity is available at the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov. FDX is rated “BBB” by S&P Global Ratings (www.standardandpoors.com) and is rated “Baa2” by Moody’s (www.moodys.com), which are both considered “Investment Grade” ratings. The references in this report to the SEC’s website, S&P Global Ratings’ website and Moody’s website are not intended to and do not include or incorporate by reference into this report the information of FDX, S&P Global Ratings or Moody’s on such websites.
 
We may issue securities for property; however, this has not occurred to date. We may repurchase or reacquire our shares from time to time if, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, such acquisition is in our best interest. No shares were repurchased or reacquired during fiscal 2018 and, as of September 30, 2018, we do not own any of our own shares.
 
Property Management
 
With the exception of three properties, all of our 111 properties are self-managed by us.
 
We paid fees directly to local property management subagents of approximately $437,000, $394,000 and $356,000 for fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Our industrial properties in Stow, OH and Streetsboro, OH are managed by GEIS Companies (GEIS). Management fees we paid to GEIS for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $78,000, $52,000 and $50,000, respectively. These management fees were reimbursed to us by the tenants.
 
Our industrial property in Carlstadt, NJ is owned by Palmer Terrace Realty Associates, LLC. We own 51% of Palmer Terrace Realty Associates, LLC. This property is managed by Marcus Associates, an entity affiliated with the owner of the 49% non-controlling interest. Management fees paid by Palmer Terrace Realty Associates, LLC to Marcus Associates were approximately $17,000, $16,000 and $16,000 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations, an owner of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at, on, in or under such property as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances. These liabilities may include government fines and penalties and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or disposal of such substances. Although generally our tenants are primarily responsible for any environmental damages and claims related to the leased premises, in the event of the bankruptcy or inability of a tenant of such premises to satisfy any obligations with respect to such environmental liability, we may be required to satisfy such obligations. In addition, as the owner of such properties, we may be held directly liable for any such damages or claims irrespective of the provisions of any lease.


From time to time, in connection with managing the properties or upon acquisition of a property, we authorize the preparation of Phase I and, when necessary, Phase II environmental reports with respect to our properties. Based upon such environmental reports and our ongoing review of our properties, as of the date of this Annual Report, we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties which we believe would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or results of operations. There can be no assurance, however, that (1) the discovery of environmental conditions, the existence or severity of which were previously unknown; (2) changes in law; (3) the conduct of tenants; or (4) activities relating to properties in the vicinity of our properties, will not expose us to material liability in the future.
