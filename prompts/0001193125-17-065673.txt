Business Overview 
 We are a global provider of cloud and enterprise communications and collaboration solutions. Through our software product development, we help more than 60 million business end users, including more than three million cloud communications end users around the world, to seamlessly connect, collaborate and provide innovative solutions to their customers. 
 Our strategy is built on the principle of putting customers first by providing a seamless technology path that will enable businesses to communicate, collaborate and participate in the digital transformation that is reshaping business models and competition globally. In the past five years, we have fundamentally reoriented our company from a premise-based unified communications and telephony business to become a diverse global market leader with established positions in the cloud and enterprise markets. As a result of both our organic in-house development and our merger and acquisition activity, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to offer business customers a comprehensive portfolio of complementary and interoperable communications and collaborations solutions. 
 Our software enables customers to upgrade their communications environments at their own pace, whether in a cloud or enterprise environment. Our solutions generally interoperate with various systems supplied by other vendors, including global market leaders such as VMware, Microsoft, Salesforce.com and Google. This interoperability allows our customers to utilize their existing communications infrastructure and gives them the flexibility to choose the solutions that best address their individual business needs. We have also designed our software and end-user devices to allow access to our solutions from mobile devices. Our mobile applications are compatible and available for use on some of the worlds leading mobile devices, including those from Apple and Samsung. We complement our communications solutions with support, professional and managed services for our customers, including channel partners, which range from planning and design through to implementation and support. 
 Our Cloud Division (reported as the Cloud segment) offers a full range of private, public, hybrid and mobile Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions for businesses of all sizes. This includes Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) solutions, which enable businesses to consume and pay for their communications services on a monthly subscription basis. We also offer cloud-based telephone and network services in the United States. 
 Our Enterprise Division (reported as the Enterprise segment) offers a broad range of unified communications and collaboration (UCC) solutions, which address and support the full spectrum of technology specifications - from digital to IP to cloud to mobile, and from platforms to applications to end-user devices. Our enterprise solutions include the latest virtualization capabilities and desktop and mobile applications to enable businesses of all sizes to take advantage of the most advanced technology developments while maximizing their current communications investments. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2016, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Mobile Division to the parent company of Xura, Inc. This disposition represents our strategic shift to focus on our core business. The Mobile Division offers 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) mobile networking products to mobile carriers. The transaction closed on February 28, 2017. 
 We have invested heavily in the research and development (R&D) of our IP-based communications and collaboration solutions to take advantage of the worldwide shift from traditional digital communications systems to IP-based cloud, mobile and enterprise solutions. We believe our early and sustained R&D has positioned us to capitalize on the industry shift from legacy systems to IP and cloud communications solutions, including UCC solutions used in desktop and mobile environments. We control a global patent portfolio of over 1,600 patents and pending applications. We believe our R&D provides us with the enhanced knowledge to anticipate expected market trends and meet the current and future needs of our customers and channel partners. 
 With a global geographic footprint, we have customers in more than 100 countries. We are structured around three primary geographic markets defined as the Americas, which includes the United States, Canada and the Caribbean and Latin America; EMEA, which includes the continent of Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific, which includes the continent of Asia and the Pacific region, including Australia and New Zealand.

Segments 
 Our business from continuing operations is organized into: Cloud and Enterprise segments. Our Cloud and Enterprise Divisions sell products primarily through an indirect distribution channel model, addressing the needs of business customers worldwide through approximately 2,000 channel partners. 
Cloud Division 
 The Cloud Division portfolio includes a comprehensive family of cloud communications services that are designed to meet the complete communications requirements of our business customers. Offered under the MiCloud branding, the portfolio includes a full suite of cloud-based UCC solutions (voice services, dial plans, audio conferencing, voicemail, call center functionality, video conferencing, along with team collaboration applications) that provide seamless mobility and reliability, and are built to suit small and growing businesses along with large scale enterprises. MiCloud solutions and services are sold in a direct and indirect model for the consumption of end users and partners alike. Services, in most cases, are offered on a monthly subscription basis (as a fixed operational expense), aiming to eliminate the need for organizations to buy and maintain a phone system on their premises. The portfolio also enables partners and service providers to create highly optimized service offerings they can host themselves or through a Mitel operated data center. 
Enterprise Division 
 The Enterprise Division portfolio integrates voice, unified communications and collaboration applications, and contact center applications on fixed and mobile networks across a wide range of end-user devices such as desk phones, mobile phones, tablets, desktop and laptop computers. The Enterprise Division sells and supports business communications products and services to customers that prefer premises-based or private cloud deployments. This includes our IP-based telephony platforms, desktop devices, in-building mobile devices, UCC and contact center applications that are primarily deployed on the customers premises. Premises-based sales are typically sold as an initial sale of hardware and software, with ongoing recurring revenue from hardware and software maintenance and other managed services that we may also offer. 
Mitels Product Portfolio 
 In recent years, we have capitalized on acquisition opportunities to expand our capabilities and deliver an integrated product portfolio that enhances the offerings we can provide to our channel partners and customers. At the same time, we continue to focus on our R&D investments to ensure that we are in a position to offer a compelling path toward new functionality for our customers. 
 Our product portfolio includes premises and cloud-based enterprise communications infrastructure products and solutions, UCC and contact center applications and a variety of value-added service offerings.

Partnerships 
 One important result of the evolution of integrated communications and cloud solutions is the simplicity with which products and services, from a variety of sources, can be easily integrated to provide a better solution for customers. By partnering with others, we can concentrate on our core areas of expertise while leveraging the capabilities of our channel partners for the benefit of customers. We have four key types of technology partnerships: strategic alliances, operational partners, affiliates and solution alliances.

Customers 
 Our customers include more than 60 million business end users, ranging from the smallest business to the largest enterprise, and include more than three million cloud communications end users. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues from continuing operations in fiscal 2016. We have also developed a comprehensive understanding of certain vertical markets, such as hospitality, education, government, healthcare, and retail. Our solutions can be tailored to meet the business communications needs of these and other vertical markets. 
Competition 
 We compete in the cloud and enterprise communications markets, providing products and services for transporting data, voice and video traffic across intranets, extranets, mobile networks and the internet. These markets are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages. These market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us. We compete with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our new product markets. As we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. 
 Competitors for the Cloud Division include hosted and cloud services providers, such as Avaya Inc., Atos SE, Broadsoft, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., 8X8, Inc., J2 Global, Inc., Ring Central Inc., Sprint Nextel Corporation, ShoreTel, Inc., Verizon Communications Inc., Vonage, Inc., West IP Communications, Inc., and XO Holdings, Inc., and other hosted PBX providers. In our wholesale cloud offerings, we also face competition from AT&T, Inc., CBeyond Inc., U.S. Telepacific Corp., Verizon Communications Inc., XO Holdings, Inc. and other communications service providers. 
 Competitors for the Enterprise Division are primarily from two groups of vendors: traditional IP communications vendors and software vendors who are adding communications and collaboration solutions to their offerings. We compete against many traditional IP communications vendors, including Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise, Ascom Holding AG, Avaya Inc., Atos SE, Cisco Systems, Inc., Enghouse Interactive, Ericsson-LG, Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories, Inc., Grandstream Networks, Inc., Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd, NEC Corporation, Panasonic Corporation, Polycom, Inc., ShoreTel, Inc., Snom Technology AG, Toshiba Corporation, VTech Holdings Limited and Yealink Inc. We also compete with software vendors who, in recent years, have expanded their offerings to address the UCC market. This group of competitors includes Microsoft Corporation and Google Inc. 
 Some of these companies compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area. New ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. As we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those markets. We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and in our view this trend may increase. In addition, because the market for our products is subject to rapid technological change as the market evolves, we may face competition in the future from companies that do not currently compete in our markets, including companies that currently compete in other sectors of information technology, communications and software industries. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Our Cloud and Enterprise segments are primarily supported through an indirect distribution model, which addresses the needs of our customers in more than 100 countries through our channel partners worldwide. We believe our extensive channel partner network, which includes approximately 2,000 partners, combined with our corporate and regional support, allows us to scale our business for volume and sell our solutions globally, resulting in an efficient cost-of-sale model. We recruit our channel partners with a focus on expanding market coverage and securing the skills needed to successfully sell, implement and support our communications solutions. 
Research and Development 
 We regularly seek to introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets. Our history of success in software-based cloud and enterprise communications solutions has provided us with the foundation for continued innovation. Our R&D personnel are skilled with deep domain expertise in the diverse areas of telecommunications, IP networking, Unified Communications, Contact Center solutions software and web technologies. We work to continuously improve our R&D efforts through operational measurement, adoption of best practices, effective partnerships and investment in our people. We put the customer experience at the center of everything we do. Further, we have initiated R&D investment on the intersection of our mobile, cloud and enterprise portfolios to provide our customers and channel added benefit as these technology markets converge.

At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 600 employees working in our R&D department on cloud and enterprise solutions. Our global R&D workforce is located predominately in North America, Europe, and India. 
 Please see Item 6, Selected Financial Data, of Part II in this Annual Report for the amount spent during each of the last five fiscal years on R&D activities determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. 
 Manufacturing and Supply Chain Management 
 A significant amount of our enterprise and cloud portfolios consists of appliances and desktop devices. Our objective is to deliver high-quality and unique products to our channel partners and customers while optimizing our operational cost structure and ensuring continuity of supply. To meet this objective, we leverage our contract manufacturers and component suppliers, protect supply continuity and facilitate manufacturing portability across manufacturers. 
 We primarily use high-volume contract manufacturers and component suppliers. We require our component suppliers to make information visible so that we can assess their performance for technical innovation, financial strength, quality, support and operational effectiveness. Our primary contract manufacturers are Flextronics International Ltd. and Pegatron Corporation, with whom we have held manufacturing relationships since 2006 and 2012, respectively. We also utilize a number of smaller contract manufacturers for our legacy product portfolio. We do not have any long-term purchase commitments with any of our contract manufacturers. 
 In order to maintain our continuity of supply and reduce supply chain barriers, our strategy for several years has been to design our products for manufacturing portability and to procure our high-volume products from a number of contract manufacturers. We implement portable designs by limiting the use of custom and sole source components and by adhering to industry standard Design For Manufacture and Design For Test guidelines. We manage our own product distribution facilities either directly or through the use of third-party logistics management specialists, and, in some regions, wholesale distributors, all of which are managed by our logistics team. This is implemented with geographically diverse points of distribution, with our principal facilities being in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our intellectual property assets include patents, industrial designs, trademarks, proprietary software, copyrights, domain names, operating and instruction manuals, trade secrets and confidential business information. These assets are important to our competitiveness and we continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio in order to protect our rights in new technologies and markets. We have a broad portfolio of over 1,600 patents and pending applications, covering over 500 inventions, in areas such as Voice over IP, collaboration, presence, messaging and mobility. 
 We leverage our intellectual property by asserting our rights in certain patented technologies. Certain companies have licensed or offered to purchase patents within our portfolio. 
 Our solutions contain software applications and hardware components that are either developed and owned by us or licensed to us by third parties. The majority of the software code embodied in our products has been developed internally and is owned by us. 
 In some cases, we have obtained non-exclusive licenses from third parties to use, integrate and distribute with our products certain packaged software, as well as customized software. This third-party software is either integrated into our own software applications or sold as separate self-contained applications, such as voicemail or unified messaging. The majority of the software that we license is packaged software that is made generally available and has not been customized for our specific purpose. If any of our third-party licenses were to terminate, our options would be to either license a functionally equivalent software application or develop the functionally equivalent software application ourselves. 
 We have also entered into a number of non-exclusive license agreements with third parties to use, integrate and distribute certain operating systems, digital signal processors and semiconductor components as part of our communications platforms. If any of these third-party licenses were to terminate, we would look to license functionally equivalent technology from another supplier. 
 It is our general practice to include confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions in the agreements entered into with our employees, consultants, manufacturers, end users, channel partners and others to attempt to limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. In addition, it is our practice to enter into agreements with employees that include an assignment to us of all intellectual property developed in the course of their employment. 
 The risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Intellectual Property.

Employees 
 We had a total of approximately 3,300 employees worldwide from continuing operations as of December 31, 2016. We consider our relationship with all of our employees to be positive. Competition for technical personnel in the industry in which we compete is intense. We believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire, integrate, and retain qualified personnel. To date, we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees, but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future. 
Mobile Division  Discontinued Operations 
 The Mobile Division portfolio includes solutions that deliver mobile voice and video, enhanced messaging and core network infrastructure. The Mobile Division was formed in connection with the Mavenir Acquisition and primarily sells and supports software-based telecommunications networking solutions that enable mobile network operators to deliver IP-based voice, video, rich communications and enhanced messaging services to their subscribers. Our broad range of software solutions for 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) mobile networks include Rich Communication Services (RCS), which enable enhanced mobile communications, such as group text messaging, multi-party voice or video calling, as well as next-generation voice services including Voice over LTE (VoLTE) and Voice over Wi-Fi (VoWi-Fi). Revenue in the Mobile Division is generated from sales of networking solutions. After the initial implementation of a networking solution, we may sell additional software licenses, which may include additional hardware to support the capacity licenses, and additional periods of post-contract support. Products include: 

 | Voice and video
--+----------------


 | Converged Messaging
--+--------------------


 | SBCs and Border Gateways
--+-------------------------


 | IMS Core
--+---------


 | Diameter Signaling
--+-------------------


 | Evolved Packet Core
--+--------------------

 Competitors for the Mobile Division include major network infrastructure suppliers, which include Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson, Nokia Corporation and Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., specialty or point solution suppliers, which include Oracle Corporation and Sonus Networks, Inc., voice application server suppliers such as Broadsoft, Inc. and Metaswitch Ltd., and messaging specialists such as Comverse, Inc. The Mobile Division also competes with some of our channel partners that sell our Equipment Identity Register. We believe that the areas in which we compete with these channel partners will have no material impact on existing resale arrangements. 
 At December 31, 2016, the mobile division had approximately 690 R&D employees, predominately located in North America, India and China. 
 On February 28, 2017, we completed the sale of our Mobile Division to the parent company of Xura, Inc.. See Item 1. BusinessBusiness Overview. The Mobile Division, previously reported as the Mobile segment, is deemed to be held for sale and the financial results of this business are presented as a discontinued operation. 
 For financial information on our business segments for the last three fiscal years, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
