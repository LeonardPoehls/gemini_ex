Equities
Equities Research, Sales and Trading
We provide our clients full-service equities research, sales and trading capabilities across global securities markets. We earn commissions or spread revenue by executing, settling and clearing transactions for clients across these markets in equity and equity-related products, including common stock, American depository receipts, global depository receipts, exchange-traded funds, exchange-traded and over-the-counter (“OTC”) equity derivatives, convertible and other equity-linked products and closed-end funds. Our equity research, sales and trading efforts are organized across three geographical regions: the Americas; Europe and the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia Pacific. Our clients are primarily institutional market participants such as mutual funds, hedge funds, investment advisors, pension and profit sharing plans and insurance companies. Through our global research team and sales force, we maintain relationships with our clients, distribute investment research and strategy, trading ideas, market information and analyses across a range of industries and receive and execute client orders. Our equity research covers over 2,000 companies around the world and a further more than 800 companies are covered by nine leading local firms in Asia Pacific with whom we maintain alliances.
Equity Finance
Our Equity Finance business provides financing, securities lending and other prime brokerage services. We offer prime brokerage services in the U.S. that provide hedge funds, money managers and registered investment advisors with execution, financing, clearing, reporting and administrative services. We finance our clients’ securities positions through margin loans that are collateralized by securities, cash or other acceptable liquid collateral. We earn an interest spread equal to the difference between the amount we pay for funds and the amount we receive from our clients. We also operate a matched book in equity and corporate bond securities, whereby we borrow and lend securities versus cash or liquid collateral and earn a net interest spread. We offer selected prime brokerage clients the option of custodying their assets at an unaffiliated U.S. broker-dealer that is a subsidiary of a bank holding company. Under this arrangement, we directly provide our clients with all customary prime brokerage services.
Wealth Management
We provide tailored wealth management services designed to meet the needs of high net worth individuals, their families and their businesses, private equity and venture funds and small institutions. Our advisors provide access to all of our institutional execution capabilities and deliver other financial services. Our open architecture platform affords clients access to products and services from both our firm and from a variety of other major financial services institutions.
Fixed Income
Fixed Income Sales and Trading
We provide our clients with sales and trading of investment grade corporate bonds, U.S. and European government and agency securities, municipal bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, leveraged loans, consumer loans, high yield and distressed securities, emerging markets debt, interest rate derivative products, as well as foreign exchange trade execution and securitization capabilities. Jefferies is designated as a Primary Dealer by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Jefferies International Limited is designated in similar capacities for several countries in Europe. Additionally, through the use of repurchase agreements, we act as an intermediary between borrowers and lenders of short-term funds and obtain funding for various of our inventory positions. We trade and make markets globally in cleared and uncleared swaps and forwards referencing, among other things, interest rates, investment grade and non-investment grade corporate credits, credit indexes and asset-backed security indexes.
Our strategists and economists provide ongoing commentary and analysis of the global fixed income markets. In addition, our fixed income desk strategists provide ideas and analysis to clients across a variety of fixed income products.
Investment Banking
We provide our clients around the world with a full range of equity capital markets, debt capital markets and financial advisory services. Our services are enhanced by our deep industry expertise, our global distribution capabilities and our senior level commitment to our clients.

Equity Capital Markets
We provide a broad range of equity financing capabilities to companies and financial sponsors. These capabilities include private equity placements, initial public offerings, follow-on offerings, block trades and equity-linked convertible securities transactions.
Debt Capital Markets
We provide a wide range of debt and acquisition financing capabilities for companies, financial sponsors and government entities. We focus on structuring, underwriting and distributing public and private debt, including investment grade debt, high yield bonds, leveraged loans, municipal debt, mortgage and other asset-backed securities, and liability management solutions.
Advisory Services
We provide mergers and acquisition and restructuring and recapitalization services to companies, financial sponsors and government entities. In the mergers and acquisition area, we advise sellers and buyers on corporate sales and divestitures, acquisitions, mergers, tender offers, spinoffs, joint ventures, strategic alliances and takeover and proxy fight defense. In the restructuring and recapitalization area, we provide companies, bondholders and lenders a full range of restructuring advisory capabilities as well as expertise in the structuring, valuation and placement of securities issued in recapitalizations.
Asset Management
Through Jefferies Investment Advisers, LLC (“JIA”) and partnerships with Leucadia Asset Management LLC (“LAM”), we manage and provide services to a diverse group of alternative asset management platforms across a spectrum of investment strategies and asset classes. We are supporting and developing focused strategies managed by distinct management teams.  Products currently offered by JIA to pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional investors through these platforms include systematic quantitative and global equity event-driven strategies.
Leucadia has made investments in certain managed accounts and funds managed by these programs and, accordingly, a portion of the net results are allocated directly to Leucadia.
Competition
All aspects of our business are intensely competitive. We compete primarily with large global bank holding companies that engage in capital markets activities, but also with other broker-dealers, asset managers and investment banking firms. The large global bank holding companies have substantially greater capital and resources than we do. We believe that the principal factors affecting our competitive standing include the quality, experience and skills of our professionals, the depth of our relationships, the breadth of our service offerings, our ability to deliver consistently our integrated capabilities, and our culture, tenacity and commitment to serve our clients.
Regulation
Regulation in the United States. The financial services industry in which we operate is subject to extensive regulation. In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) is the federal agency responsible for the administration of federal securities laws, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) is the federal agency responsible for the administration of laws relating to commodity interests (including futures and swaps). In addition, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and the National Futures Association (“NFA”) are self-regulatory organizations that are actively involved in the regulation of financial services businesses. The SEC, CFTC, FINRA and the NFA conduct periodic examinations of broker-dealers, investment advisers, futures commission merchants (“FCMs”) and swap dealers. The designated examining authority for Jefferies’ activities as a broker-dealer is FINRA, and the designated self-regulatory organization for Jefferies’ FCM activities is the NFA. Financial services businesses are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions and attorneys general in those states in which they do business.

JEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

Broker-dealers are subject to SEC and FINRA regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading methods, trade practices among broker-dealers, use and safekeeping of customers’ funds and securities, capital structure of securities firms, anti-money laundering efforts, recordkeeping and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. Registered advisors are subject to, among other requirements, SEC regulations concerning marketing, transactions with affiliates, disclosure to clients, and recordkeeping; and advisors that are also registered as commodity trading advisors or commodity pool operators are also subject to regulation by the CFTC and the NFA. FCMs, introducing brokers and swap dealers that engage in commodities, futures or swap transactions are subject to regulation by the CFTC and the NFA. Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by the SEC, CFTC, FINRA or NFA, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or rules may directly affect the operations and profitability of broker-dealers, investment advisers, FCMs and swap dealers. The SEC, CFTC, FINRA, NFA, state securities commissions and state attorneys general may conduct administrative proceedings or initiate civil litigation that can result in adverse consequences for Jefferies and its officers and employees (including, without limitation, injunctions, censures, fines, suspensions, membership expulsions, or revocations of licenses and registrations. In addition, broker-dealers, investment advisers, FCMs and swap dealers must also comply with the rules and regulation of clearing houses, exchanges and trading platforms of which they are a member.
Regulatory Capital Requirements. Several of our entities are subject to financial capital requirements that are set by regulation. Jefferies is a dually registered broker-dealer and FCM and is required to maintain net capital in excess of the greater of the SEC or CFTC minimum financial requirements. As a broker-dealer, Jefferies is subject to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule (the “Net Capital Rule”). Jefferies has elected to compute its minimum net capital requirement in accordance with the “Alternative Net Capital Requirement” as permitted by the Net Capital Rule, which provides that a broker-dealer shall not permit its net capital, as defined, to be less than the greater of 2% of its aggregate debit balances (primarily customer-related receivables) or $250,000 ($1.5 million for prime brokers). Compliance with the Net Capital Rule could limit Jefferies’ operations, such as underwriting and trading activities, that could require the use of significant amounts of capital, and may also restrict its ability to make loans, advances, dividends and other payments.
As a non-clearing FCM, Jefferies is required to maintain minimum adjusted net capital of $1.0 million.
Our subsidiaries that are provisionally registered swap dealers will become subject to capital requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act once the relevant rules become final. For additional information see Item 1A. Risk Factors - “Recent legislation and new and pending regulation may significantly affect our business.”
Jefferies Group LLC is not subject to any regulatory capital rules.
See Net Capital within Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Note 17, Net Capital Requirements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of net capital calculations.
Regulation outside the United States. We are an active participant in the international capital markets and provide investment banking services internationally, primarily in Europe and Asia. As is true in the U.S., our international subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulations proposed, promulgated and enforced by, among other regulatory bodies, the European Commission and European Supervisory Authorities (including the European Banking Authority and European Securities and Market Authority), U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, the Japan Financial Services Agency and the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Every country in which we do business imposes upon us laws, rules and regulations similar to those in the U.S., including with respect to some form of capital adequacy rules, customer protection rules, data protection regulations, anti-money laundering and anti-bribery rules, compliance with other applicable trading and investment banking regulations and similar regulatory reform. For additional information see Item 1A. Risk Factors - “Extensive international regulation of our business limits our activities, and, if we violate these regulations, we may be subject to significant penalties.”
