     Overview
 Nivalis Therapeutics, Inc. is a pharmaceutical company that has historically been focused on the discovery and development of product candidates for patients with cystic fibrosis, or CF. Our GSNOR inhibitors selectively target an enzyme known as S-nitrosoglutathione reductase, which we refer to as GSNOR. GSNOR regulates levels of an endogenous protein known as S-nitrosoglutathione or GSNO. Depleted levels of GSNO have been associated with CF, asthma, inflammatory bowel diseases and certain cardiovascular diseases. Our lead product candidate, cavosonstat (N91115), is a small molecule inhibitor of GSNOR being evaluated in patients with CF. However, in light of recent results from a clinical trial of cavosonstat in CF patients, we determined to discontinue the development of this compound in CF and we have shifted our strategic emphasis to focus on identifying and evaluating strategic alternatives not related to GSNOR inhibition or specific to CF. We currently do not have any drugs that are commercially available and none of our drug candidates have obtained the approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or any similar foreign regulatory authority.

In November 2016, we announced that a Phase 2 clinical trial of cavosonstat had failed to achieve its primary endpoint of lung function improvement and a key secondary endpoint of sweat chloride reduction. This clinical trial was conducted in 138 adult CF patients with two copies of the F508del-CFTR mutation who were being treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor or Orkambi™ and was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of cavosonstat in a triple therapy with lumacaftor/ivacaftor, or Orkambi. We are also evaluating the efficacy and safety of cavosonstat in a separate Phase 2 trial of 19 adult CF patients with one copy of the F508del-CFTR mutation and a second gating mutation who are being treated with ivacaftor or Kalydeco™. Enrollment in this trial was completed in November 2016 and results are expected in the first quarter of 2017. After completion of this trial, we do not expect to expend material resources on the development of cavosonstat or any other drug candidates in our portfolio. 

Following the failure of the Phase 2 clinical trial in CF patients with two copies of the F508del mutation in November 2016, we announced on January 3, 2017 the initiation of a process to explore and review a range of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value from our clinical assets and cash resources and our intent to streamline our operations in order to conserve capital. As part of this process, we engaged a financial and strategic advisor, Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc., to advise us on strategic alternatives in January 2017. Our board of directors also approved a reduction in force that is taking place between January 15 and March 31, 2017 that will affect a total of 25 employees, including our former President and Chief Executive Officer, and our former Chief Medical Officer, whose employment was terminated effective January 15, 2017. We expect to have approximately five employees after completion of the reduction in force on March 31, 2017. As described above, we continue to conduct limited activities related to completion of our in-process clinical trials. All other research and development activities have ceased.

We expect to devote substantial time and resources to exploring strategic alternatives that our board of directors believes will maximize stockholder value. Our consideration of strategic alternatives includes, but is not limited to, the potential for an acquisition, merger, business combination, licensing and/or other strategic transaction involving the company. Despite devoting significant efforts to identify and evaluate potential strategic transactions, we may not be successful in completing a transaction. Further, even if a strategic transaction is completed, it ultimately may not deliver the anticipated benefits or enhance stockholder value. 

Based on years of focused research in the GSNOR area, and notwithstanding the failure of cavosonstat to achieve the primary endpoint within a Phase 2 trial in CF, we continue to believe that compounds that interact specifically with GSNOR may have the potential to achieve positive medical effects by modulating its activity in the body. Cavosonstat and other GSNOR inhibitor drug candidates in our portfolio may have benefit in other clinical indications, such as, inflammatory lung and bowel diseases, and certain cardiovascular diseases. Cavosonstat is the furthest advanced in development of these potential candidates. In addition to the clinical safety profile, chronic toxicology testing for six months in rats and nine months in dogs has also been completed along with a six-month carcinogenicity trial in RASh transgenic mice. 

We have built a patent portfolio covering the structure or therapeutic use of small molecules designed to selectively inhibit GSNOR activity. We own exclusive rights to cavosonstat in the United States and all other major markets, including U.S. composition of matter patent protection until at least 2031. We do not have current plans to continue development of any of our GSNOR inhibitor drugs ourselves.
 Our lead product candidate, cavosonstat, is a small molecule inhibitor of GSNOR. In patients with CF, decreased CFTR activity is due in part to reduced levels of GSNO, which is regulated by GSNOR. GSNO modifies the function of certain CFTR chaperone proteins, and thereby improves the stability of F508del CFTR. Our preclinical studies have previously shown that cavosonstat is a selective and reversible inhibitor of GSNOR, that GSNOR inhibition increased GSNO levels, and that the stabilizing effect of cavosonstat significantly increased and prolonged CFTR activity when added to other CFTR modulators. The ultimate goal of our CFTR stabilizing therapy was, therefore, to increase and prolong CFTR activity through GSNOR inhibition when cavosonstat was administered along with other CFTR modulators, thereby increasing chloride transport. In other models of inflammatory lung and bowel disease, cavosonstat also demonstrated positive anti-inflammatory effects.
 Our Business Strategy
 Our strategy is currently focused on identifying and evaluating strategic alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value from our GSNOR inhibitor portfolio and cash resources. These alternatives may include, but are not

limited to, the potential for an acquisition, merger, business combination, licensing and/or other strategic transaction involving the company. We have engaged Ladenburg Thalman & Co., Inc. to act as our strategic financial advisor for this process. We have ceased all further research activities and plan to complete activity related to our ongoing clinical trials in CF during the first quarter of 2017. Whether or not we are successful in concluding a strategic transaction, we currently have no plans to pursue any further GSNOR inhibitor development ourselves. 
 Clinical Development of Cavosonstat to Date
 We filed an investigational new drug application, or IND, for the commencement of clinical trials of cavosonstat with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, on December 30, 2013. To date, we have completed dose escalation and drug-drug interaction trials in healthy subjects, a pharmacokinetic trial in CF patients, a Phase 1b clinical trial that assessed safety and tolerability in CF patients who were homozygous for F508del, and a Phase 2 clinical trial to assess efficacy and safety in that same patient population. Cavosonstat was well-tolerated in those trials with no dose-limiting safety findings when administered up to 800 mg twice daily in healthy subjects and 400 mg twice daily in CF patients. Including the Phase 2 clinical trial in CF patients that is concluding in the first quarter of 2017, we have completed two Phase 2 and five Phase 1 studies of cavosonstat as further described below. Cavosonstat has exhibited linear plasma level exposures with increases in dose resulting in proportional increases in both maximum plasma levels, or Cmax, and area under the curve, or AUC, for plasma concentration versus time in healthy subjects and CF patients. There has been no significant systemic drug accumulation detected up to 12 weeks of administration. To date, there have been no significant human safety issues detected nor have there been any dose limiting toxicities observed, and the accumulated preclinical and clinical safety data provide support for the continued study of cavosonstat in other potential indications. 
     In 2015, we completed a Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of cavosonstat in adult CF patients homozygous for F508del. This trial met its stated objectives by demonstrating no dose-limiting toxicities of cavosonstat and informing dose selection for our Phase 2 clinical trial. The Phase 1b trial was a randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, parallel group trial with three doses of cavosonstat, at 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg, administered twice daily. These doses and a placebo were administered over 28 days in a total of 51 patients. The independent data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, concluded that there were no dose limiting toxicities observed with cavosonstat. We reported the top line results from this trial in September 2015 and presented the results at the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference in October 2015. The data showed a trend toward a reduction in sweat chloride at the highest dose tested which was statistically significant using a within group comparison. The lack of dose limiting toxicity and a potential sweat chloride signal supported the inclusion of a higher dose in the Phase 2 trials.
 Our first clinical trial of cavosonstat was a Phase 1, multiple ascending dose, safety and pharmacokinetic trial in healthy subjects. Cavosonstat was well tolerated with no dose‑limiting toxicities noted up to 500 mg per day. In this trial, four cohorts each with six healthy subjects received 14‑day dosing at 10 mg, 50 mg, 250 mg and 500 mg per day and two cohorts each with six healthy subjects received single doses of 50 mg and 250 mg. 
 Our second Phase 1 trial of cavosonstat was an open‑label trial in CF patients homozygous for the F508del mutation. Six CF patients were dosed with 50 mg of cavosonstat twice daily for 14 days. The AUC in the CF patients was 97% of that in healthy subjects from our first Phase 1 trial. This trial showed that no dosing adjustments would be required for CF patients.
 Our third Phase 1 trial was the trial described above in F508del homozygous patients.
 Our fourth Phase 1 trial was a drug-drug interaction study using Rifampin as a surrogate for lumacaftor/ivacaftor because of its similar drug metabolizing properties. The drug-drug interaction trial was conducted in preparation for dose selection for Phase 2 and no adjustment of the cavosonstat dose was required on the basis of the results of this trial.
 Our fifth Phase 1 trial was designed to assess the maximum tolerated dose of cavosonstat in order to provide dosing flexibility should the Phase 2 trial have suggested that a higher dose was warranted. A total of 32 healthy subjects were included and the maximum dose tested was 800mg twice daily. Final analysis of the trial data is pending and expected during the first quarter of 2017.

 In late 2016 we completed the Phase 2 clinical trial of cavosonstat in 138 CF patients who had two copies of the F508del mutation and were receiving treatment with Orkambi. This three arm, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study evaluated the efficacy and safety of two doses of cavosonstat administered with Orkambi, compared to placebo administered with Orkambi. The primary endpoint of the study was the change from baseline to week 12 in absolute percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second or ppFEV1 from baseline to week 12. Statistical significance between each active dose and placebo (Orkambi) was not achieved for the primary and key secondary endpoints.
     In the first quarter of 2017, we expect to complete a Phase 2, proof-of-concept study to further evaluate the effect of cavosonstat in patients who have one copy of the F508del-CFTR mutation and a second mutation that results in a gating defect in the CFTR protein. The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cavosonstat in adult patients who have these mutations and who are being treated with Kalydeco.
     Preclinical Safety Studies
 We had previously conducted repeat oral‑dose, 28 and 90‑day toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs in support of up to 12 weeks of treatment in Phase 2 clinical trials. In 2016 we also completed chronic toxicity studies of six months duration in rats and nine months duration in dogs. These species are routinely selected for toxicology testing and were deemed appropriate for small molecule inhibitors of GSNOR. All three species exhibited toxicities that were generally mild and occurred at higher exposures than intended in humans. The toxicology data generated thus far suggest the kidney, liver and possibly bone marrow may be target organs. Completion of the chronic toxicity studies provides support for human clinical trials of long-term duration. Additionally, a carcinogenicity study of six months duration was completed in transgenic mice and cavosonstat showed no carcinogenic effects. Other GSNOR Inhibitors
 Our operations to date have focused on discovery and development of our portfolio of GSNOR inhibitors, including cavosonstat and N6022. N6022 was the first product candidate to emerge from our GSNOR inhibitor portfolio, and was optimized for inhaled delivery with low oral bioavailability. We advanced N6022 into the clinic in an intravenous formulation to explore safety, tolerability and pharmacological attributes of this novel class of compounds. N6022 paved the way for cavosonstat by establishing initial safety of the class in healthy subjects and patients with CF. In order to provide translational evidence of GSNOR’s role in lung disease, we initially explored the effects of N6022 in patients with mild asthma. N6022 demonstrated a significant effect on the airways, as measured by airway hyper-reactivity thus confirming the beneficial effects of N6022 observed in our preclinical studies of asthma. Because an oral dosage form is preferable in CF, a systemic disease that is not confined to the lung, we elected to discontinue further development of N6022 in the chronic management of CF. Currently, we do not plan to pursue development of N6022 in an inhaled or intravenous dosage form for other potential indications. 
 Our GSNOR inhibitor portfolio includes other compounds with differing chemical structures and properties suitable for oral, inhaled, injectable and topical administration. Although we are not pursuing further development ourselves, preclinical evidence supports a potential role for these compounds in indications such as inflammatory lung and bowel diseases and certain cardiovascular disorders. 
 Manufacturing and Supply
 We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of drug substance or drug product. We have terminated our existing contracts for the production of cavosonstat and are currently establishing contracts for the storage of existing supplies of drug substance and drug product, and for destruction of those supplies should that be required.
 The manufacturing process for cavosonstat and N6022 is relatively straightforward and generally in line with other small molecule pharmaceutical compounds in terms of cost and complexity. The process is robust and reproducible within our current specifications, does not require dedicated reactors or specialized equipment, uses common synthetic 

 
  6

 
chemistry and readily available materials, including off-the-shelf and made-to-order starting materials, and is readily transferable.
 Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements that govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. The contract manufacturers that we used to manufacture our drug substance and drug product did so under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, a regulatory standard for the production of pharmaceuticals. All contract manufacturers used in production had been inspected by the FDA for compliance to cGMP and maintained FDA establishment licenses.
 Competition
  We have no current plans to further develop or commercialize our portfolio of GSNOR inhibitors. However, to the extent a potential strategic transaction results in the further development of these candidates, potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Key competitive factors are likely to be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement. Many of these potential competitors have substantial financial, technical and human resources and significant experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Further, mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of competitors. Accordingly, competitors may be more successful in obtaining FDA approval for therapies and achieving widespread market acceptance. Competitors’ products may also be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any product candidate that may be commercialized and may render our therapies obsolete or non‑competitive before development and commercialization expenses can be recovered. Intellectual Property
 We believe that we have a strong patent portfolio and substantial know‑how relating to cavosonstat (N91115) and our other product candidates. Our patent portfolio, described more fully below, includes claims directed to CFTR modulator compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds and methods of making and using the same. As of December 31, 2016, we are the owner of record of 32 issued U.S. patents and 213 issued non‑U.S. patents. We continue to pursue an additional 10 U.S. patent applications including three provisional U.S. applications, four international patent applications, and 32 non‑U.S. patent applications in over ten foreign countries. We are the licensee of five issued U.S. patents and seven issued non‑U.S. patents.
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including our product candidates and our processes, and will continue to devote resources to do so while we identify and evaluate potential strategic opportunities. We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our products, their methods of use and processes of manufacture and any other technology to which we have rights, where available and when appropriate. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
 We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents will be useful in protecting our technology. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.”
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional priority application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent.

 
  7

 

 The term of a U.S. patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. 
 The patent portfolios for our proprietary technology portfolio and our two most advanced product candidates are summarized below.
 Cavosonstat (N91115)
 The patent portfolio for cavosonstat includes wholly owned patents and patent applications directed to GSNOR inhibitors, including cavosonstat and other compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, methods of making such pharmaceutical compositions and methods of using such compounds and pharmaceutical compositions. Specific for our cavosonstat product candidate, we have six issued U.S. patents, pending U.S. patent applications, and corresponding foreign national or regional counterpart issued patents and/or patent applications pending in Europe, Japan and other countries. Our U.S. patents are expected to expire in 2031, excluding any additional term that may be available due to a patent term extension. Patents, if issued, based on these pending U.S. and foreign patent applications are expected to expire in 2031, excluding any additional term that may be available due to patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. We also have a pending international application directed to combination therapies. Patents, if issued, based on this pending international patent application, are expected to expire in 2035, excluding any additional term that may be available due to patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. We have three additional pending international patent applications directed to various cavosonstat related inventions. Patents, if issued, based on these pending international patent applications, are expected to expire in 2036, excluding any additional term that may be available due to patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. We also have three pending U.S. provisional patent applications directed to various cavosonstat related inventions. Patents, if issued, based on future patent applications filed claiming priority to these pending U.S. provisional patent applications, are expected to expire in 2037, excluding any additional term that may be available due to patent term adjustments or patent term extensions.
 N6022
 The patent portfolio for N6022 includes wholly owned patents and patent applications directed to GSNOR inhibitors, including N6022 and other compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, methods of making such pharmaceutical compositions and methods of using such compounds and pharmaceutical compositions. Specific for our N6022 product candidate, we have six issued U.S. patents, pending U.S. patent applications and corresponding foreign national or regional counterpart issued patents and/or patent applications pending in Europe, Japan, and other foreign countries. The six issued U.S. patents are expected to expire in 2029, excluding any additional term that may be available due to patent term extension. Patents, if issued, based on pending U.S. and foreign patent applications are expected to expire in 2029 excluding any additional term that may be available due to patent term adjustments or extensions.
 Trade Secrets
 In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know‑how to protect our proprietary technology and processes. Trade secrets and know‑how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade 

 
  8

 
secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know‑how and inventions.
 Regulatory Matters
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of new drugs.
 A number of different regulatory agencies may be involved, depending on the product at issue, and the type and stage of activity. These include the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other federal agencies, state boards of pharmacy, state controlled substance agencies and more.

U.S. Government Regulation

Drug Development Process
  In the United States, the FDA is a primary regulator of drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and other compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with applicable requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject us to adverse consequences and administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications; withdrawal or restriction of an approval; imposition of a clinical hold or other limitation on research; Warning Letters; product seizures; total or partial suspension of development, production, or distribution; or injunctions, fines, disgorgement, or civil or criminal payments or penalties.
  The process required before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal trials and formulation trials conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, animal welfare laws and other applicable regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials, meaning trials in human subjects, in the United States may begin, obtaining similar authorizations in other jurisdictions where clinical research will be conducted and maintaining these authorizations on a continuing basis throughout the time that trials are performed and new data are collected;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to demonstrate whether a proposed drug is safe and effective for its intended use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | preparation and submission to the FDA of a marketing authorization application, such as a new drug application, or NDA, and submitting similar marketing authorization applications in other jurisdictions where commercialization will be pursued;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product will be produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  9

 


· | FDA review and approval of the NDA or other marketing authorization application.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The development, testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, as well as bearing inherent risk that individual products will not exhibit relevant safety, effectiveness, or quality characteristics. We cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or with the specific terms that we desire, if at all.
  Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

· | Phase 1. The drug initially is introduced into a small number of healthy human volunteers and is tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2. Clinical trials are initiated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug candidate for specific targeted diseases, and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall benefit‑risk profile of the drug candidate and provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval and product labeling. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Progress reports related to clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and participating IRBs, and more frequent safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and to investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, and certain other purposes. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the healthy volunteers or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the investigational product apparently lacks efficacy. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements or if the drug candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to healthy volunteers or patients.
  We estimate that it generally takes 10 to 15 years, or possibly longer, to discover, develop and bring to market a new pharmaceutical product in the United States. Several years may be needed to complete each phase, including discovery, preclinical, Phase 1, 2 or 3, or marketing authorization.
  At times during the development of a new drug product, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA. This commonly occurs prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 testing, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may also be requested. These meetings provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. A plan for pediatric assessment also must be discussed at the end of Phase 2 meeting.
  Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate, and the manufacturer must develop methods for confirming the identity, quality, purity, and potency of the final products. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability trials must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf‑life and distribution pathway.

Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
  Sponsors of clinical trials (other than Phase 1 trials) of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, comparator, patient 

 
  10

 
population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of certain trials may be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. However, there are evolving rules and increasing requirements for publication of trial related information, and it is possible that data and other information from trials involving drugs that never garner approval could in the future be required to be disclosed. In addition, publication policies of major medical journals mandate certain registration and disclosures as a pre-condition for potential publication, even when this is not currently mandated as a matter of law. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.

New Drug Application Review and Approval Processes
  The results of drug candidate development, preclinical trials and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug candidate, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug candidate. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees; a waiver of fees may be obtained under limited circumstances.
  The FDA reviews each NDA to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in depth review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug candidate is safe and effective for its intended use and indication for use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the drug candidate’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee consisting of a panel of external experts for review and recommendation as to whether the NDA should be approved and under what conditions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the active ingredient and the formulated drug candidate are manufactured and tested.
  The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical or other data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a Complete Response Letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA in its present form. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the Complete Response Letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval.
  If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific diseases, dosages, or indications for use, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post‑approval trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
  The FDA has various programs, including fast track, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation, that are intended to increase agency interactions, expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing drug candidates, and/or provide for initial approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Generally, drug candidates that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life‑threatening conditions, have the potential to address unmet medical needs and offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. The FDA has granted orphan drug and fast track designations for cavosonstat in CF. Based on the clinical trial results with cavosonstat, however, the FDA may decide that it no longer meets the conditions for qualification. Moreover, the time period for FDA review may not actually be shortened even if a drug candidate has qualified for an expedited development program.

 
  11

 

  If a drug candidate is approved under certain expedited programs, for example, the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the approval may be conditioned upon post marketing requirements, including the completion of post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 trials, to confirm the effect on the desired clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval trials, or the inability to confirm a clinical benefit during post marketing trials, may allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. In addition, all promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 Post‑approval Requirements
 Any products that receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record‑keeping requirements, reporting and analysis of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety, efficacy and quality information, product sampling and distribution requirements, maintaining up‑to‑date labels, warnings, and contraindications, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the approved label; products cannot be promoted for unapproved, or off‑label, uses, although physicians may prescribe drugs for off‑label uses in accordance with the practice of medicine. Manufacturers must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to manufacturing processes often require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post‑marketing programs.
  Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections for compliance with cGMP and other laws. FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at manufacturing that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct.
  Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market such as adverse events the existence or severity of which was unknown when the product was approved. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or complete withdrawal from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical trials, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal payments or penalties.
  From time to time, new legislation is enacted that changes the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing, and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance may be revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory or policy changes will occur or be implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.

Orphan Drug Designation
  Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drug candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that costs of research and development of the drug for the indication can be recovered by sales of the drug in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Although there may be some increased communication opportunities, orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.

  If a drug candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in very limited circumstances, such as if the second applicant demonstrates the clinical superiority of its product. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
  Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of our drug candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease.
  As in the United States, designation of a drug candidate as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication is available in the European Union if applied for before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product.
  The FDA and foreign regulators expect holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the orphan drug. 
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement

United States
  Even if the FDA approves NDAs for our drug candidates, sales of our products will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement by third party payers, such as government health programs, commercial or private insurance, and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product. Third party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA‑approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
  The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 European Union
  In Europe and many other foreign countries, the success of our drug candidates we may develop, depends largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement, because in many foreign countries patients are unlikely to use prescription pharmaceutical products that are not reimbursed by their governments. Negotiating reimbursement rates in foreign countries can delay the commercialization of a pharmaceutical product and generally results in a reimbursement rate that is lower than the net price that companies can obtain for the same product in the United States.
  In some countries, such as Germany, commercial sales of a product can begin while the reimbursement rate that a company will receive in future periods is under discussion. In other countries, a company must complete the reimbursement discussions prior to the commencement of commercial sales of the pharmaceutical product. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides

options for its member states to restrict the range of drugs for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of drugs for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the drug or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug on the market. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries.
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
  Pharmaceutical companies also are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti‑kickback laws and false claims laws, and the reporting of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business.Anti‑kickback Laws
  U.S. federal laws, including the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, prohibit fraud and abuse involving state and federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and federal agencies, including CMS, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General for HHS, and various state agencies. These anti‑kickback laws prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal healthcare program. Remuneration is broadly defined to include anything of value, such as cash payments, gifts or gift certificates, discounts, or the furnishing of services, supplies, or equipment. The anti‑kickback laws are broad and prohibit many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. A person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
  The penalties for violating the anti‑kickback laws can be severe. The sanctions include criminal and civil penalties, and possible exclusion from the federal healthcare programs. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal anti‑kickback laws, and some apply to items and services reimbursable by any payer, including third party payers.
 Federal and State Prohibitions on False Claims
  The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment under federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Under the False Claims Act, a person acts knowingly if he has actual knowledge of the information or acts in deliberate ignorance or in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information. Although we would not submit claims directly to government payers, manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off‑label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law.
  Provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring an action on behalf of the federal government and to share in any amounts paid by the defendant to the government in connection with the action. The number of filings under these provisions has increased significantly in recent years. Conduct that violates the False Claims Act may also lead to exclusion from the federal healthcare programs. In addition, various states have enacted similar laws modeled after the False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state healthcare programs, and, in several states, such laws apply to claims submitted to all payers.

 Federal Prohibitions on Healthcare Fraud and False Statements Related to Healthcare Matters
  There are numerous federal and state laws protecting the privacy and security of protected health information. Additionally, a number of related crimes can be prosecuted related to healthcare fraud, false statements relating to healthcare matters, theft or embezzlement in connection with a health benefit program, and obstruction of criminal investigation of healthcare offenses. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including a private insurer. Violation of any of these laws is a felony and may result in fines or exclusion from the federal healthcare programs.Physician Payment Sunshine Act
  The Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires most pharmaceutical manufacturers to report annually to the Secretary of HHS financial arrangements, payments, or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals. The payment information is made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements can result in significant civil monetary penalties. Similar laws have been enacted or are under consideration in foreign jurisdictions, including France, which has adopted the Loi Bertrand, or French Sunshine Act, which became effective in 2013.The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
  The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing, or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. In many countries, the healthcare professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for purposes of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.Other Regulations
  In addition to the statutes and regulations described above, we also are subject to regulation in the United States under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations, now or hereafter in effect. Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials, and governing any future distribution and commercial sales, if any, of our products. Whether or not FDA approval is obtained for a drug candidate, the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, must approve commencement of clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, or diabetes and optional for those medicines that are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more “concerned” member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one-member state, known as the “reference” member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether or not to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
