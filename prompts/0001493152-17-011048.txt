Business of Issuer
 
We were an exploration stage company until May 2017, at which time we transitioned to a senior retirement solutions company focusing on senior housing and retirement services and products.
 
On January 20, 2008, the Company allowed its interest in the Sobeski Lake Gold Property Claims to expire. The Sobeski Lake Gold property consisted of three mineral claims located in the Red Lake Mining District, in the province of Ontario, Canada. We had originally acquired our interest in the property by making a cash payment of $3,500 on June 16, 2004 to Dan Patrie Exploration Ltd. the registered owners of the property.
 
On January 8, 2008, we acquired, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Dynamic Gravel Holdings Ltd., a 100% interest in two gravel claims called the Northern Gravel Claims and Super Mammoth Gravel Claims (together the “Super Mammoth Gravel Project”) situated on tidewater for $25,000. The Super Mammoth Gravel Project was acquired by way of a purchase agreement. Mr. Farshad Shirvani has been paid CDN$25,000.
 
On April 27, 2017, the Company dissolved its wholly owned subsidiary, Dynamic Gravel Holdings Ltd. as part of the Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) dated April 4, 2017, between Tim Coupland and Brian Game, the Company’s former principal stockholders (the “Sellers”) and Hartford International Retirement Network, Inc. (the “Buyer”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Sellers agreed to sell to the Buyer, and the Buyer agreed to purchase from Sellers, a total of 5,185,000 shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Sellers (the “Purchase Shares”). The Purchase Shares represented approximately 52.1% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock.
 
In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the Board appointed Lianyue Song, Aaron Schottelkorb and Fuming Lin to fill vacancies on the Company’s Board of Directors caused by resignations of Messer’s’ Coupland, Game and Burylo.
 
On May 11, 2017, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding for Senior Holiday Service Cooperation with Shanghai Qiao Garden International Travel Agency (“Travel Agent”), superseded by a Retirement Vacation Services Agreement executed by the parties on August 25, 2017 (collectively referred to as the “Agreement”). The Company is engaged in the business of providing hotel rooms at favorable rates to travelers to Los Angeles from China. The Company’s president is a principal owner and CEO of a brand new hotel in Rosemead, California, and the Company is acting as its agent to procure business from Chinese tourists and business travelers. Under the Agreement with the Travel Agent, the Travel Agent has agreed to provide no less than 300 retirement vacation clients per year for a minimum hotel stay of 3,000 nights. The Agreement also provides for payment of a monthly service fee. The Agreement automatically renews on an annual basis unless otherwise terminated by either party in writing. However, the Company intends to enter into a more permanent agreement in September, 2018. From June 1 through July 31, 2017, the Company has received approximately $100,000 in revenues in connection with the Agreement. The Company is currently marketing its hotel travel service to other travel agencies in China and it is also seeking other hotels in Southern California to sign up for its services.
 
The Company believes that with the execution of the Agreement on May 11, 2017 and the commencement of revenues from its travel service business that it is no longer a “shell” corporation.
 
In addition, the Company intends to provide management services to retirement homes, commercial properties and apartment buildings in the following China cities: Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hainan and Shenyang.
 
On May 18, 2017, the Company sold its Northern Gravel Claims and the Super Mammoth Gravel Claims for $1 to the Company’s former officer and a former director to focus its efforts on new business venture in senior retirement services and products in China.
 
Between July 1 and August 28, 2017, the company sold 27,610,000 shares of its common stock (the “Shares”) to 48 investors for $1,380,500. The Shares were sold by the officers and directors of the Company and no commissions were paid for such sales. All of the investors are residents of China and all offers and sales were conducted in China. The Shares were sold in a private placement pursuant to an exemption under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act), in accordance with Regulation S of the Act. All stock certificates will be affixed with the appropriate Regulation S legend restricting sales and transfers.

Employees
 
At present, there are no employees, other than the current officers and directors, who devote their time as required to the business operations.
 
Competition
 
While the senior retirement services and products business is competitive, management does not anticipate having difficulties retaining customers. The Company is currently marketing its hotel travel service to other travel agencies in China and it is also seeking other hotels in Southern California to sign up for its services.
 
In the senior retirement services and products sector, our competitive position is insignificant. There are numerous companies with substantially more capital and resources that are capable of securing greater number of customers or contracts with travel agencies overseas. We are not able to compete with such companies. Instead, management has determined that the Company will attempt to focus in its core network, such as Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hainan and Shenyang.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patents or trademarks.
 
Risk Factors
 
An investment in the common stock of the Company involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this annual report before investing in our common stock. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
 
Risks Relating to the Company
 
If we do not obtain additional financing, our business will fail.
 
Our cash reserves are not sufficient to meet our obligations for the next-twelve month’s period. As a result, we will need to seek additional funding in the near future. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding. However, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. As well, our management is prepared to provide us with short-term loans.
 
We will require additional financing to sustain our business operations. We do not currently have any arrangements for financing and we can provide no assurance to investors that we will be able to find such financing if required. Obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number of factors, including general market conditions. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing unavailable to us.
 
The most likely source of future funds presently available to us is through the sale of equity capital or loans from our directors. Any sale of share capital will result in dilution to existing shareholders.
 
From June 1 through July 31, 2017, the Company has received approximately $100,000 in revenues in connection with the Agreement with the Travel Agent. Also, between July 1 and August 28, 2017, the company sold 27,610,000 shares of its common stock (the “Shares”) to 48 investors for $1,380,500. However, there is no guarantee that we will able to obtain additional financing in the future.
 
Because we have limited business operating history and we face a high risk of business failure.
 
We have been operating the senior retirement services and products business since May 2017. Accordingly, we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful.
 
Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new retirement services and products companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to securing customers and travel agents, and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates.

There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and we can provide investors with no assurance that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail.
 
Our independent auditor believes there is substantial doubt that we will continue as a going concern. If we do not continue as a going concern, you will lose your investment.
 
The Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2017, indicates that there are a number of factors that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Such factors identified in the report are our net loss position, our failure to attain profitable operations and our dependence upon obtaining adequate financing. If we are not able to continue as a going concern, it is likely investors will lose their investments.
 
Because our directors own 52.1% of our outstanding common stock, they could make and control corporate decisions that may be disadvantageous to other minority shareholders.
 
Our directors own approximately 52.1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, they will have a significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including mergers, consolidations, and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. They will also have the power to prevent or cause a change in control. The interests of our directors may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and thus result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders.
 
Because our directors have other business interests, they may not be able or willing to devote a sufficient amount of time to our business operations, causing our business to fail.
 
Our President will be devoting only 60% of his time to our business upon commencement of business operations. Currently our, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary devote approximately 80% of their time to our affairs. It is possible that the demands on our officers and directors from their other obligations could cause them to be unable to devote sufficient time to the management of our business. In addition, they may not possess sufficient time for our business if the demands of managing our business increased substantially beyond current levels.
 
Risks Relating to Our Common Stock
 
The trading price of our common stock on the OTCQB Venture Market – OTC Market will fluctuate significantly and stockholders may have difficulty reselling their shares.
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, our common stock trades on the OTCQB Venture Market – OTC Market under the symbol “HFRN”. There is a volatility associated with Bulletin Board securities in general and the value of your investment could decline due to the impact of any of the following factors upon the market price of our common stock: (i) disappointing results from our operations; (ii) failure to meet our revenue or profit goals or operating budget; (iii) decline in demand for our common stock; (iv) lack of funding generated for operations; (v) investor perception of our industry or our prospects; and (vi) general economic trends.
 
In addition, stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of securities have been highly volatile. These fluctuations are often unrelated to operating performance and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, investors may be unable to sell their shares at a fair price and you may lose all or part of your investment.

Our common stock is considered a penny stock. Trading of our stock is restricted by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s penny stock regulations which may limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock.
 
Our stock is considered a penny stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines “penny stock” to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors”. The term “accredited investor” refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer’s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.
 
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, has adopted sales practice requirements which may also limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock.
 
In addition to the “penny stock” rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.
 
Reports to Securities Holders
 
We are required to file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission on a regular basis, and will be required to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and bankruptcy) in a current report on Form 8-K.
 
You may read and copy any materials we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission at their Public Reference Room Office, 100 F Street, NE, Room 1580, Washington, D.C. 20549-0102. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the Securities and Exchange Commission at 1-800-SEC-0330. Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Commission maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
