Item 1. | BUSINESS

In this annual report on Form 10-K, “USG,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to USG Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements, except as otherwise indicated or as the context otherwise requires.
General
USG, through its subsidiaries, is a leading manufacturer of building materials and innovative solutions. We produce a wide range of products for use in new residential, new nonresidential, and residential and nonresidential repair and remodel construction as well as products used in certain industrial processes. Our businesses are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including, in particular, conditions in the North American housing and construction-based markets and the markets in Asia and Australasia. Our expansion via two 50/50 joint ventures we formed in 2014 with Boral Limited, referred to as USG Boral Building Products, or UBBP, into the markets of Asia, Australasia, and the Middle East has significantly increased our exposure to the economic conditions in those areas. 
The effects of market conditions on our operations are discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Recent Developments
On October 31, 2016, we completed the sale of L&W Supply Corporation, or L&W, to American Builders & Contractors Supply Co., Inc., or ABC Supply, for $675 million inclusive of the final working capital adjustment. We recognized a gain of $279 million on the transaction. Additionally, we entered into a supply agreement with L&W that governs sales of wallboard and certain other products from USG to L&W. 
During 2016, we retired $1.1 billion of outstanding debt consisting of our 6.3% Senior Notes due 2016, our 7.875% Senior Notes due 2020 and our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2021, and recorded a pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $37 million. 
Segments
Our operations are organized into three reportable segments: Gypsum, Ceilings and UBBP. As a result of the presentation of L&W as a discontinued operation, the results of L&W, which consisted of all of our Distribution segment, have been excluded from segment results. Additionally, the results of our Gypsum and Ceilings segments have been revised to reflect only the sales of USG products from Gypsum and Ceilings to L&W that have been sold by L&W outside the consolidated group prior to October 31, 2016. All sales to L&W subsequent to the close of the transaction are included in net sales. 
The net sales of Gypsum and Ceilings accounted for approximately 83% and 17%, respectively, of our 2016 consolidated net sales. UBBP is accounted for as equity method investments, and thus, net sales of UBBP are not included in consolidated net sales.
Gypsum
BUSINESS
Our Gypsum segment manufactures and markets gypsum and related products in the United States, Canada and Mexico. It includes United States Gypsum Company, or U.S. Gypsum, in the United States, CGC Inc., or CGC, in Canada, USG Mexico, S.A. de C.V., or USG Mexico, and subsidiaries in Latin America. U.S. Gypsum is the largest manufacturer of gypsum wallboard in the United States and accounted for approximately 25% of total industry shipments of gypsum board (which includes gypsum wallboard, other gypsum-related paneling products and imports) in the United States in 2016. CGC accounted for approximately 42% of Canadian domestic shipments and is the largest manufacturer of gypsum wallboard in eastern Canada. USG Mexico is the largest manufacturer of gypsum wallboard in Mexico with more than 50% market share in 2016. 
PRODUCTS
Gypsum’s products are used in a variety of building applications to construct walls, ceilings, roofs and floors of residential, commercial and institutional buildings, as well as in certain industrial applications. We also produce gypsum-based products for agricultural and industrial customers to use in a wide variety of applications, including soil conditioning, road repair, fireproofing and ceramics. The major product lines within the Gypsum segment are:

USG Sheetrock® Brand UltraLight Panels accounted for 66% of all of our wallboard shipments in the United States in 2016, 65% in 2015 and 63% in 2014.
MANUFACTURING
Gypsum manufactures products at 41 plants located throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Latin America.
Gypsum rock is mined or quarried at 12 company-owned locations in North America. Our mines and quarries provided approximately 49% of the gypsum used by our plants in North America in 2016. 
Some of our manufacturing plants purchase or acquire synthetic gypsum and natural gypsum rock from outside sources. In 2016, outside sources of synthetic gypsum and natural gypsum rock accounted for approximately 42% and 9%, respectively, of the gypsum used in our plants. 
Synthetic gypsum is a byproduct of flue gas desulphurization carried out by electric generation or industrial plants that burn coal as a fuel. The suppliers of this kind of gypsum are primarily power companies, which are required to operate scrubbing equipment for their coal-fired generating plants under federal environmental regulations. We have entered into a number of long-term supply agreements to acquire synthetic gypsum. Six of our 21 gypsum wallboard plants in operation use synthetic gypsum for all of their needs, while another six use it for a portion of their needs. Certain power companies have switched to using natural gas instead of coal for their electric generation needs. In the event more power companies switch to using natural gas instead of coal, the availability of synthetic gypsum may decrease which could result in an increase to our cost. See Item 1A, Risk Factors.
We produce wallboard paper at four company-owned production facilities located in the United States. Vertical integration in paper helps to ensure a continuous supply of high-quality paper that is tailored to the specific needs of our production processes. We augment our paper needs through purchases from outside suppliers when necessary. We did not make any material purchases of paper from outside suppliers in 2016.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
Our gypsum products are marketed and distributed through specialty wallboard distributors, building materials dealers, home improvement centers and other retailers and contractors. Sales of gypsum products are seasonal in the sense that sales are generally greater from spring through the middle of autumn than during the remaining part of the year.
Based on our estimates using publicly available data, internal surveys and industry shipment data for gypsum board, as reported by the Gypsum Association, we estimate that during 2016 volume demand for gypsum board was generated by:

• | residential and nonresidential repair and remodel activity of about 50%,


• | new residential construction of about 39%,


• | new nonresidential construction of about 6%, and


• | other activities, such as exports and temporary construction of about 5%.

COMPETITION
Industry shipments of gypsum board in the United States (including gypsum wallboard, other gypsum-related paneling products and imports), as reported by the Gypsum Association, were an estimated 25.0 billion square feet in 2016, up approximately 12% from 22.3 billion square feet in 2015. U.S. Gypsum’s share of the gypsum board market in the United States, which includes for comparability its shipments of USG Sheetrock® brand gypsum wallboard, Fiberock® brand gypsum fiber panels and Securock® brand glass mat sheathing, was approximately 25% in 2016, down 1.3% from 2015.

USG Boral Building Products
BUSINESS
On February 27, 2014, we and certain of our subsidiaries formed 50/50 joint ventures, USG Boral Building Products Pte. Limited, a company organized under the laws of Singapore, and USG Boral Building Products Pty Limited, a company organized under the laws of Australia, with Boral Limited, or Boral. These joint ventures are referred to as USG Boral Building Products, or UBBP. UBBP manufactures, distributes and sells certain building products, mines raw gypsum and sells natural and synthetic gypsum throughout Asia, Australasia and the Middle East. UBBP is a leader in most of the markets it serves. As part of the consideration for our 50% ownership in UBBP, we contributed to UBBP our subsidiaries and joint venture investments in Asia-Pacific, India and Oman. Our investments in UBBP are accounted for as equity method investments. Our existing wholly owned subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities that were contributed into the joint venture were deconsolidated as of February 27, 2014. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information related to our equity method investments.

Other Information
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
To contribute to our high standards and our leadership in the building materials industry, we perform extensive research and development at the USG Corporate Innovation Center in Libertyville, Illinois, using open innovation models and outside partnerships. Research team members collaborate with suppliers, universities and national research laboratories to provide product support and to develop new products and technologies for our operating units. With fire, acoustical, structural and environmental testing capabilities, the research center allows us to conduct our own on-site evaluation of products and systems. Chemical analysis and materials characterization support product development and safety/quality assessment programs. Development activities can be taken to an on-site pilot plant before being transferred to a full-size plant. Research and development activities have been focused on customer preferred system solutions. We expense research and development expenditures as incurred. These expenditures amounted to $24 million, $23 million and $23 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. UBBP also operates a research and development center in Thailand. 
SUSTAINABILITY
The adoption of green building codes and standards such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED, rating system established by the U.S. Green Building Council to encourage the design and construction of buildings that are environmentally friendly, combined with an increase in customer preference for products that can assist in obtaining LEED credit or are otherwise environmentally preferable, has increased demand for products, systems and services that contribute to building sustainable spaces. Many of our products meet the requirements for the awarding of LEED credits, and we continue to develop new products and systems to address market demand for products that enable construction of buildings that require fewer natural resources to build, operate and maintain. Our competitors also have developed and introduced to the market more environmentally responsible products.
We expect that there will be increased demand over time for products, systems and services that meet regulatory and customer sustainability standards and preferences and decreased demand for products that produce significant greenhouse gas emissions. We also believe that our ability to continue to provide these products and systems to our customers will be necessary to maintain our competitive position in the marketplace.
ENERGY
Our primary supplies of energy have been adequate, and we have not been required to curtail operations as a result of insufficient supplies. Supplies are likely to remain sufficient for our projected requirements. Currently, we are using swap contracts to hedge a significant portion of our anticipated purchases of natural gas to be used in our manufacturing operations over the next 12 months and beyond. We review our positions regularly and make adjustments as market conditions warrant.
SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS
On a worldwide basis, for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, The Home Depot accounted for 23%, 23% and 22% of our net consolidated sales, respectively, and L&W accounted for 19%, 18% and 18% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. Both our Gypsum and Ceilings segments had net sales to these customers in each of those years. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We consider patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success. We hold numerous patents and have registered numerous trademarks of varying duration in multiple legal jurisdictions. Further, we have filed patent applications and applications for the registration of trademarks in the United States and internationally. Although we consider our patents, licenses and trade secrets to constitute valuable assets, we do not regard any of our businesses as being materially dependent upon individual patents, trade secrets, or licenses.
OTHER
Because we fill orders upon receipt, no segment has any significant order backlog.
None of our segments has any special working capital requirements.
5

No material part of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of any government.
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 6,600 employees worldwide in our wholly-owned subsidiaries.
See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for financial information pertaining to net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region and net sales, operating profit and total assets by our segments, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, for information regarding the risks associated with conducting business in international locations, as well as the possible effects that compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have on our businesses and operating results.
