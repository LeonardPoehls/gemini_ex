ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
------------+----------

General Overview
 
We are a vertically integrated manufacturer of eco-friendly building products located in the city of Pingdingshan in Henan Province, China. We are the leading producer of fly-ash bricks and concrete in Pingdingshan. In late April 2015, we launched our construction waste hauling operations in Pingdingshan, and with the collected construction waste, have added crushed construction waste, or recycled aggregates, and bricks made from recycled aggregates, or recycled bricks, to our product offerings. Since then, we have also expanded our hauling and recycling operations beyond Pingdingshan.
Our Corporate History and Structure
 
Yulong
 
Yulong is a holding company and was incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands on March 10, 2011. In March 2011, Yulong sold and issued 800,000 ordinary shares to its founding shareholder. In May 2011, Yulong sold and issued 360,000 ordinary shares to 10 investors.
 
Through a corporate restructuring in December 2011, the shareholders of Yulong BVI exchanged all of their outstanding ordinary shares of Yulong BVI for 6,840,000 ordinary shares of Yulong pursuant to the terms and conditions of a share exchange agreement dated December 11, 2011, or the Exchange Agreement. As a result, Yulong acquired all of the equity interests in Yulong BVI and Yulong BVI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yulong.
 
On July 1, 2015, we closed our initial public offering of 2,250,000 ordinary shares at $6.25 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $14 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.
 
Yulong BVI
 
Yulong BVI is a holding company and was incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, or BVI, on June 15, 2011.  The company was established to negate the payment of stamp tax necessary to transfer the shares of Yulong HK.  The transfer of shares in a Hong Kong entity incurs a 2% stamp tax pursuant to Hong Kong tax laws, whereas there is no stamp tax payable for transfer of shares in a BVI entity pursuant to BVI tax laws.  Mr. Yulong Zhu is the sole director of Yulong BVI.  The company currently does not have any employees or officers.
 
Yulong HK
 
Yulong HK is a holding company and was incorporated under the laws of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, or Hong Kong, on July 21, 2011.  The company was established to minimize Chinese withholding tax on dividends.  Pursuant to the tax treaty between Hong Kong and China, a withholding tax rate of 5% for distribution of dividends may apply on dividends received by Yulong HK if certain requirements under such tax treaty are met, while the withholding tax rate is 10% for dividends to be received by companies incorporated in most other jurisdictions.  Mr. Yulong Zhu is the sole director of Yulong HK.  The company currently does not have any employees or officers.
 
Yulong WFOE
 
Yulong WFOE is a limited liability company that was formed under the laws of the PRC on September 2, 2011, and controls Yulong Group through a series of contractual arrangements, or the VIE Agreements.  Because it is wholly owned by Yulong HK, Yulong WFOE is a wholly foreign owned enterprise, or WFOE, under Chinese law. The approved business scope as set forth in its business license includes construction engineering technology consulting and enterprise management consulting.  Other than activities relating to the VIE Agreements, the company has no other separate operations of its own.  Mr. Yulong Zhu is the sole director of Yulong WFOE.  The company currently does not have any employees or officers.
 
Although current PRC regulations do not restrict or prohibit foreign investment in domestic companies engaging in businesses such as those of our consolidated affiliated entities, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the interpretation and application of such regulations.  For example, we source construction waste for Yulong Renewable’s recycling plant through our exclusive agreement with Pingdingshan Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau, or Pingdingshan Development Bureau.  While no regulation prohibits foreign investment in Yulong Renewable, in practice, local governments will only enter into such contract if Yulong Renewable remains a domestic company.  As such, Yulong WFOE has entered into the VIE Agreements with Yulong Group and their shareholders.  We do not own any equity interests in Yulong Bricks, Yulong Concrete, Yulong Renewable or Yulong Transport, but control and receive the economic benefits of their respective business operations through the VIE Agreements.  The VIE Agreements enable us to provide these companies with consulting services on an exclusive basis, in exchange for all of their quarterly profits, if any.  In addition, we are able to appoint their senior executives and approve all matters requiring approval of their shareholders.  The VIE Agreements are comprised of an Exclusive Consulting and Operating Agreement, Equity Pledge Agreement, Option Agreement and Voting Rights Proxy and Financial Supporting Agreement, and are described in further detail under “Contractual Arrangements” below.

Under current Chinese laws and regulations, we believe that the VIE Agreements are not subject to any government approval.  The shareholders of Yulong Group were required to register with SAFE when they established Yulong BVI, and have obtained such SAFE registration in May 2011. They were also required to update such SAFE registration when we issued ordinary shares to them in connection with the Exchange Agreement, although such SAFE update has not been completed as of the date of this Report.  These shareholders have also registered their equity pledge arrangement as required under the Equity Pledge Agreement with Yulong WFOE (see “Contractual Arrangements” below). 
 
Yulong Group
 
All of our business operations are conducted through our four consolidated affiliated entities, namely, Yulong Concrete which commenced operations in 2004, Yulong Bricks in 2006, Yulong Transport in 2009, and Yulong Renewable in late April 2015.  All four companies have subsequently become our consolidated variable interest entities, or VIEs, through the VIE Agreements described below.
 
Yulong Bricks is a limited liability company established in China, and its business scope includes production and sales of fly-ash bricks and sales of building materials, steel, general merchandise and hardware. As of the date of this Report, Yulong Bricks is 54% held by Mr. Yulong Zhu, and 46% held by Mr. Hu Zhu.  The current management members of this company include Mr. Hu Zhu as executive director and general manager, Mr. Lei Zhu as supervisory director.
 
Yulong Concrete is a limited liability company established in China, and its approved business scope includes production and sales of ready-mixed concrete.  As of the date of this Report, Yulong Concrete is 80% held by Ms. Liping Zhai, and 20% held by Mr. Dangwei Wang, both of whom are cousins of our founder.  The current management members of this company include Mr. Yulong Zhu as president, Ms. Zhai as executive director, Mr. Wang as supervisory director, Mr. Ya Zhou as plant manager, Mr. Guangjian Zhu as purchase manager, Mr. Xixin Zhang as production manager, and Mr. Yaofeng Ren as quality control manager.
 
Yulong Renewable is a limited liability company established in China, and its business scope includes the production and sales of bricks, road curb bricks, running track bricks, water permeable bricks; the recycling of waste resources and metals (unless prohibited by the state); the transportation for general goods; clean-up and transportation of construction waste within planning areas; and housing demolition (excluding explosion).  As of the date of this Report, Yulong Renewable is 68.3% held by our founder, and 31.7% held by Mr. Wei Yi.  The current management members of this company include Mr. Yulong Zhu as president and general manager, and Mr. Wei Yi as supervisory director.
 
On October 30, 2015, Pingdingshan Xulong Renewable Resource Co., Ltd. Shangqiu Branch was established and incorporated in the People’s Republic of China. The entity is wholly owned by Pingdingshan Xulong Renewable Resource Co., Ltd. (“Yulong Renewable”) and engages in construction waste hauling and processing for the city center in Shangqiu district.
 
In late March 2016, the central government of the People’s of Republic of China passed Air Pollution Control Act and enforced Air Pollution Control Action Plan. The province of Henan of People’s Republic of China implemented “Province of Henan Blue Sky Action Plan” on various industries such as construction materials, coal mining. Due to this regulation and action plan, Yulong Renewable’s operation and its construction projects have been hindered. The Company has assessed the impact of this new regulations on its financial conditions. See “Item 7- Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial conditions and Results of Operations and Item 8-Financial Statements.”
 
Yulong Transport is a limited liability company established in China, and its business scope includes leasing and maintenance of mechanical equipment; general cargo transport; and special transport of goods (canned).  As of the date of this Report, Yulong Transport is 60% held by Mr. Aimin Shi, our founder’s uncle, and 40% held by Ms. Liping Zhai.  The current management members of this company include Mr. Shi as executive director, and Ms. Zhai as supervisory director.
 
Since inception, all four companies have been solely capitalized by our founder, with the other shareholders holding their respective equity interests on behalf of our founder.  Our founder believes that such arrangements are necessary to retain some measure of privacy locally. The other shareholders disclaim all of the rights and obligations associated with their equity interests, which rights and obligations are borne solely by our founder.  Additionally, the other shareholders may not transfer their equity interests without our founder’s written consent.  These arrangements are established through a Silent Shareholder Investment Agreement, or Investment Agreement, between our founder and the other shareholders.  The Investment Agreement was entered into in July 2009 with respect to Yulong Transport, in September 2012 with respect to Yulong Concrete, in March 2013 with respect to Yulong Bricks, and in August 2013 with respect to Yulong Renewable. As its purpose is to govern the relationships between our founder and other shareholders of our consolidated affiliated entities, the Investment Agreement will have no effect on the rights of our shareholders, including rights to the revenue generated by our consolidated affiliated entities or interests in their assets. Such rights and interests will instead be dependent entirely on the contractual arrangements through which we control our consolidated affiliated entities, and the exercise and enforcement of our rights under such contractual arrangements (see “Contractual Arrangements” below). Except through such exercise and enforcement, neither we nor you have any other right to the revenue or assets of our consolidated affiliated entities, since we do not have any ownership of them. However, reliance on the contractual arrangements may not always be effective. See “Risk Factors–Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure–Our contractual arrangements with our consolidated affiliated entities may not be as effective in providing operational control as direct ownership.” In addition, because the contractual arrangements are governed by Chinese laws, enforcement of our rights may be uncertain. See “Risk Factors–Risks Related to Doing Business in China–Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us.”

Contractual Arrangements
 
While we do not have any equity interest in our consolidated affiliated entities, we have been and are expected to continue to be dependent on them to operate our business as long as there is uncertainty in the interpretation and application by local governments of regulations concerning foreign investments in companies such as our consolidated affiliated entities.  We rely on our consolidated affiliated entities to maintain or renew their respective qualifications, licenses or permits necessary for our business in China. We believe that under the VIE Agreements, we have substantial control over our consolidated affiliated entities and their respective shareholders to renew, revise or enter into new contractual arrangements prior to the expiration of the current arrangements on terms that would enable us to continue to operate our business in China after the expiration of the current arrangements, or pursuant to certain amendments and changes of the current applicable PRC laws, regulations and rules on terms that would enable us to continue to operate our business in China legally. While we currently do not anticipate any changes to PRC laws in the near future that may impact our ability to carry out our business in China, no assurances can be made in this regard. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—Changes in China’s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us.” For a detailed description of the risks associated with our corporate structure and the contractual arrangements that support our corporate structure, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure.”

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In the opinion of our PRC legal counsel:
 

● | the corporate structure of Yulong WFOE and Yulong Group companies in China comply with all existing PRC laws and regulations; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the VIE Agreements are valid, binding and enforceable under PRC law, and will not result in any violation of PRC laws or regulations currently in effect; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Each of Yulong WFOE and Yulong Group companies has all necessary corporate power and authority to conduct its business as described in its business scope under its business license. Each such business license is in full force and effect. Each of Yulong WFOE and Yulong Group companies is capable of suing and being sued and may be the subject of any legal proceedings in PRC courts. To the best of our PRC counsel’s knowledge after due inquiries, none of Yulong WFOE, Yulong Group companies or their respective assets is entitled to any immunity, on the grounds of sovereignty, from any action, suit or other legal proceedings; or from enforcement, execution or attachment. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have been advised by our PRC legal counsel, however, that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, regulations and rules.  Accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities may in the future take a view that is contrary to the above opinion of our PRC legal counsel.  If the PRC government finds that the foregoing agreements that establish the structure for operating our PRC business do not comply with applicable PRC regulations, we could be subject to severe penalties including being prohibited from continuing operations.  See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure—Our contractual arrangements with our consolidated affiliated entities may not be as effective in providing operational control as direct ownership.” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us.”

Our Business
 
Fly-ash Bricks
 
We produce fly-ash bricks through Yulong Bricks, which operates our brick plant located adjacent to our headquarters in Pingdingshan.  Our bricks are used in and around Pingdingshan in connection with commercial, industrial, and residential constructions.  We refer to our bricks as “fly-ash” bricks because they are produced in part from reclaimed fly-ash.  When power plants use coal to generate electricity, fly-ash is the lightweight and powdery residue from the coal combustion process.  Fly-ash is typically disposed of in landfills and ash ponds, although some may be released directly into the atmosphere.  With ever-rising energy demand fueled by Pingdingshan’s economic growth, however, power plants are generating fly-ash at levels that threaten to overwhelm available landfill and ash pond sites.  By recycling fly-ash for our bricks, we believe that our brick-making process is a viable and environmentally friendly solution to the fly-ash disposal problem by helping to reduce landfill space.
 
Traditional bricks in China are made up primarily of cement, which is mixed with water and silt, pressed into a mold for shaping, and then fired in a kiln, or furnace, at temperature of between 900 and 1000 degree Celsius to harden and achieve strength.
 
We use reclaimed fly-ash primarily as a substitute for cement, and at least 30% of each of our bricks is fly-ash.  We believe that fly-ash reduces both the density and heat conductivity of our bricks without sacrificing their durability and strength.  In addition, because the fly-ash is reclaimed wastes, we believe that our bricks are consistent with government policies such as the national energy conservation policy that the Chinese central government announced at the beginning of calendar year 2013.  We also believe the availability of fly-ash in coal-rich Pingdingshan allows us to manage any seasonal and other fluctuations in cement supply.
 
In addition to cement and fly-ash, our bricks contain gypsum, quicklime and aluminum powder in accordance with industry standards and requirements.  The following illustrates our production process:
 



(1) | We currently have four production lines, each with an oven approximately 31 meters in length, holding up to the equivalence of 18 uncut blocks per load. Each production line can produce approximately 300 m3 of bricks per day and 100,000 m3 of bricks per year, although actual production may vary due to maintenance and repairs. 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Housing and Urban-Rural Construction Department of Henan Province has certified our use of reclaimed fly-ash, which certification also signifies our conformance with the central government’s policy to foster and support resource conservation and management.  We also believe that our bricks are environmentally friendly because they require less energy and generate fewer pollutants to produce, and are more cost effective, than traditional fired cement bricks. Our production process is ISO:9000 certified by Beijing ZhongDaHuaYuan Certification Center, which certification is nationally recognized, including by the Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision of Henan Province.

We currently produce 13 standard sizes of bricks, ranging from 0.015 to 0.045 m3.  Our bricks are primarily used in industrial, commercial and residential construction for foundation and structural walls.  We also produce custom-size bricks to order, although their productions have historically not been significant at less than 1% of the bricks produced.  We generally operate our plant on two shifts of eight hours each, with some overtime operation as deemed necessary during the year.  
 
We also have arrangements with a third-party manufacturer to produce on our behalf.  Under such arrangements, the manufacturer uses its employees and equipment to produce bricks using our pre-formulated raw material blends that we provide and under our supervision, and allows us to stage the finished products onsite until our customers take delivery.  In return, we pay a fee for every m3 of bricks that the manufacturer produces for us.  In fiscal 2015 and 2016, approximately 119,200 m3 and 155,720 m3 of bricks were produced under such arrangements, respectively, although orders did not exceed our production during such periods. Instead, we used the manufacturer at the request of one of our suppliers to which it is affiliated. Our suppliers are generally the largest suppliers locally and many of them are state-owned enterprises. As such, it may be difficult to replace them with other local suppliers in terms of the quantity and quality of their raw materials and their pricing. We have agreed to the supplier’s request to use its affiliate in order to maintain good relationships and to ensure that we can access sufficient raw materials as necessary. Approximately 24.5% and 34.4% of our bricks sold in fiscal 2015 and 2016, respectively, were produced under such arrangements.
 
Our standard operating procedures allow us to exercise quality control during every step of the production process, and we train our personnel to strictly operate by such procedures.  We also maintain a sample of each production batch in the event of any quality issue that may develop.
 
The cost of transportation and storage that our customers incur usually limits the market area for our bricks to within approximately 120 kilometers of our plant site and, therefore, sales are generally driven by the level of construction activity within Pingdingshan.
 
Ready-Mixed Concrete
 
We produce ready-mixed concrete through Yulong Concrete, which operates our concrete plant approximately five kilometers from our headquarters, and distribute the concrete through Yulong Transport, which operates our fleet of concrete mixer trucks.  Our ready-mixed concrete consists of proportioned mixes we prepare in accordance with each customer’s specifications and deliver in an unhardened plastic state for placement and shaping into designed forms at the job site.
 
Selecting the optimum mix for a job entails determining not only the ingredients that will produce the desired permeability, strength, appearance and other properties of the concrete after it has hardened and cured, but also the ingredients necessary to achieve a workable consistency considering the weather and other conditions at the job site.  We believe we can achieve product differentiation for the mixes we offer because of the variety of mixes we can produce, our volume production capacity and our scheduling, delivery and placement reliability.
 
Concrete is primarily a mixture of paste (comprising of cement and water) and aggregates (comprising of sand and gravel.  Aggregates comprise approximately 60% to 80% of the total volume of concrete.  Proper proportioning of paste to aggregates is crucial to achieving strong and durable concrete.  Using insufficient amount of paste, for example, will result in porous concrete with rough, honeycombed surface.  Excessive paste, on the other hand, will reduce the concrete’s strength and durability.  Properly proportioned concrete has the ideal malleability for placement with the necessary strength and durability once hardened and cured.
 
The type and size of the aggregate mixture determines the thickness and purpose of the concrete, with a continuous gradation of particle size being desirable for efficient use of the paste.  The strength of the paste depends on the ratio of water to cement, with lesser water being desirable generally.  We produce ready-mixed concrete by combining cement, aggregates, and other cementitious materials (described below) with water and, typically, one or more admixtures. These admixtures, such as chemicals, minerals and fibers, determine the usefulness of the product for particular applications.
 
We use a variety of chemical admixtures to achieve one or more of five basic purposes:
 

● | relieve internal pressure and increase resistance to cracking in subfreezing weather; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | retard the hardening process to make concrete more workable in hot weather; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | strengthen concrete by reducing its water content; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | accelerate the hardening process and reduce the time required for curing; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | facilitate the placement of concrete having low water content. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

Most common chemical admixtures we use include pumping agent, super-plasticizer, and expansive admixtures.
 
We frequently use various mineral admixtures as supplements to cement, which we refer to as cementitious materials, to alter the permeability, strength and other properties of concrete. These materials include (i) fly ash; (ii) ground slag, a byproduct of iron and steel manufacturing; and (iii) silica fume, a waste byproduct from the manufacture of silicon or ferro-silicon metal.  These materials also reduce the amount of cement content used which results in a reduction in CO2 emissions.
 
Our concrete is delivered premixed, or ready-mixed, to a customer’s jobsite.  The following illustrates our standard operating procedure after an order is placed and delivery date is confirmed:
 


We currently operate two mixing towers at our plant. Each tower is designed to produce approximately 750 m3 daily and 200,000 m3 annually, although actual production may vary due to maintenance and repairs.  Once mixed, the concrete can remain in a plastic state in a mixer truck for approximately six hours. We produced 494,147 m3 and 420,189 m3 of concrete in fiscal 2015 and 2016, respectively.  Our production process is ISO:9000 certified by Beijing ZhongDaHuaYuan Certification Center, which certification is nationally recognized, including by the Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision of Henan Province.
 
We generally operate our plant on two shifts of eight hours each, with some overtime operation as deemed necessary during the year.  We also have arrangements with a third-party manufacturer to make concrete for us with its employees and equipment usually when demand exceeds our production, which was the case in fiscal 2015 and 2016. Our arrangement with the manufacturer is identical to that we have with the third-party brick manufacturer described earlier. Approximately 182,146 m3 and 110,130 m3 of concrete were produced for us under such arrangement in fiscal 2015 and 2016, respectively. Approximately 26.9% and 20.8% of our concrete sold in fiscal 2015 and 2016, respectively, were produced under such arrangement.
 
We emphasize quality control, pre-job planning, customer service and coordination of supplies and delivery. We perform testing to determine which mix design is most appropriate to meet the required specifications.  The test results enable us to select the mixture that has the lowest cost and meets or exceeds the job specifications.  We create and maintain a project file that details the mixture we will use when we produce the concrete for the job.  For quality control purposes, we also create and maintain batch samples of concrete we have delivered to a job site, which help to ensure consistent results and minimize the need to correct completed work.

We haul and process construction waste, and produce recycled aggregates and recycled bricks, through Yulong Renewable, which operates our new recycling and brick plants on a campus approximately 15 kilometers from our headquarters. The campus also houses our research and development center, which was completed in April 2015, as well as the buildings for our new headquarters and employee dormitory when completed.
 
We have an exclusive right granted by Pingdingshan Development Bureau, to clean up and process construction waste in the built-up area of Pingdingshan (subject to exclusions imposed by special municipal regulations). The built-up area encompasses four districts, namely, Shilong, Weidong, Xinhua and Zhanhe, and two special districts, namely, Gaoxing Technology Industry Development District and Xincheng, that are administered by the municipal government. Our exclusivity is for 20 years, commencing concurrently with the formal operations of our recycling plant in late April 2015, but may be extended subject to agreement with Pingdingshan Development Bureau prior to the expiration or termination of our exclusive agreement. Additionally, we have two licenses from Pingdingshan Construction Wastes Management Office, which is a department of Pingdingshan Development Bureau and is in charge of the city’s construction waste. Specifically, we have an exclusive license to clean up, transport and process constructions waste within the city’s planning area (in this case being the built-up area of Pingdingshan), and a qualification license as required by Pingdingshan Development Bureau. Both licenses expire on October 30, 2032.
 
We operate a fleet of trucks to haul construction waste, consisting primarily bricks and concrete, from construction and demolition sites throughout the built-up area, to our recycling plant to be processed into recycled aggregates. We currently have 50 trucks. The following illustrates our recycling process:
 



(1) | Non-aggregates primarily consist of metal (such as reinforcement bars and mesh) and wood. 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We currently produce 5 sizes of recycled aggregates: 0-5 cm, 5-8 cm, 8-12 cm, 12-14 cm and 12-24 cm. The largest size aggregates are used primarily as road base, while the other three sizes are used primarily to make paving bricks. The following illustrates our production process for recycled bricks:
 


We are also actively looking to expand our hauling and recycling business beyond Pingdingshan:
 

● | In July 2015, we won a contract from an agency under the Chinese central government to haul construction waste from a section of the proposed high-speed rail line connecting the cities of Zhengzhou in Henan, and Xuzhou in Jiangsu Province. Specifically, we are responsible for the Liangyuan District section in Shangqiu, Henan, approximately 260 kilometers from Pingdingshan. The section is projected to generate over 1.3 million metric tons of construction waste through its completion, and we will receive 19 RMB per metric ton of hauled waste. We have deployed 15 trucks as well as a mobile recycling station to service this contract beginning in July 2015. The mobile station is located on a site designated by the Shangqiu municipal government, and can produce up to 2 million metric tons of recycled aggregates per year, which will be stored onsite and sold to local construction companies, although no sale has been made as of the date of this Report.

● | In September 2015, pursuant to a contract with Zhengdong New District Municipal Construction Office, we began processing construction waste stored at a dumping station in Gaozhuang Village, an administrative village of Zhengdong New District located east of Zhengzhou. The contract calls for us to process waste in such amount as determined, and from villages within the district as assigned, by the Construction Office, for which we will receive 15 RMB per metric ton of processed waste. We have deployed another mobile recycling station to Gaozhuang Village.

Customers and Sales
 
Our products are primarily sold to developers of commercial, residential and infrastructural projects, and include both state-owned and private enterprises.  Our hauling customers include government agencies and private real estate developers. For fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, no customers accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue.  The largest brick customer, No. 4 Construction Co. Limited of China Construction Seventh Bureau, accounted for 6.3% of our brick revenue and 1.7% of our total revenue.  The largest concrete customer, Henan Construction Group Co., Ltd., accounted for 15% of our concrete revenue and 8% of our total revenue.  The largest hauling customer, Shangqiu Projects, accounted for 31.9% of our hauling revenue and 1.4% of our total revenue. The largest waste processing services customer, Zhengdong New District and Urban Construction Office, accounted for 71.2% of our waste processing services revenue and 8.7% of our total revenue. The largest customer of recycled aggregates, Mr. Huijie Geng, accounted for 32.8% of our recycled aggregates revenue and 0.09% of our total revenue.  The largest customer of recycled bricks, Mr. Wei Zhang, accounted for 20.9% of our recycled brick revenue and 0.2% of our total revenue.  None of our customers is related to or affiliated with us.
 
We generally identify potential customers from the membership rosters of industry associations such as Pingdingshan Construction Association, although we also have referrals from existing customers and suppliers, and other potential customers initiate contact with us.  After consideration of a potential customer’s business, operational and financial background, the manager of our sales department will authorize sales staff to initiate contact and negotiate with the customer.  The sales manager must also approve any agreement with the customer prior to execution. An agreement is typically for one year or less, depending on our assessment of a customer’s creditworthiness.  After a customer has signed an agreement with us, the customer may order from us at any time under such agreement, specifying the amount, pricing and delivery date of the order.
 
Suppliers
 
We source all of our raw materials locally. Based on our agreements with our customers at the beginning of each calendar year, we estimate our requirements for the year and then contract with our suppliers on a monthly basis throughout the year to control inventory levels.
 
The following suppliers each accounted for 10% or more of our total spending on supplies in fiscal 2016:
 

Supplier | % of total spending on supplies | | | Raw material
----------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------+-------+---+-------------
Pingdingshan Coal Shenma Construction Group Tianyuan Cement Co., Ltd. | | 25.56 | % | | Cement (for bricks, concrete and recycling)
Henan Dadi Cement Co., Ltd. | | 17.76 | % | | Cement (for bricks and concrete) 
Pingdingshan City WeiTeng Trading Co. Ltd. | | 15.89 | % | | Cement (for bricks and concrete) 

 
None of our suppliers is related to or affiliated with us. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers are good. However, because many of them are the largest in Pingdingshan, we may have difficulty replacing any of them with another local supplier in terms of the quantity and quality of their raw materials and their pricing. See “Risk Factors–Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry–We depend on third parties for supplies essential to operate our business.”
 
Typically, the highest-cost component in a m3 of fly-ash brick is quicklime, while cement represents the highest-cost material used to produce a m3 of ready-mixed concrete.  Nevertheless, we did not purchase quicklime in a sufficient quantity from any one supplier to account for 10% or more of our total spending on supplies in fiscal 2016, which is also the case with our purchase of fly-ash.
 
Since the imposition of the New Energy Policy at the beginning of calendar year 2013 (see “Regulations – New Energy Policy” below), there has been shortage of some raw materials in Pingdingshan with attendant price increase, which we believe will continue so long as such policy is in effect. As long as we can maintain our relationship with our current suppliers and are willing to pay the prevailing market price (or higher), we believe that the shortage can be overcome. However, we may choose not to do so in order to protect our margins. Because the implementation of the New Energy Policy is nationwide, we do not believe that sourcing raw materials from outside Pingdingshan would be practicable, in addition to uncertainty with the quality of raw materials from such suppliers and potential harm to our reputation.

Intellectual Property
 
We currently do not own or license any significant intellectual property, including patent, registered trademark or copyright, in connection with our operations.
 
Competition
 
Based on internal research of published government data and our customers’ purchases, and including the bricks and concrete produced for us by third-party manufacturers, we commanded approximately 51% of the brick market and 30% of the concrete market in Pingdingshan in fiscal 2015 and 2016.  Of the numerous manufacturers currently doing business in the city, we believe that only two brick manufacturers and two concrete manufacturers have the capabilities to effectively compete against us.  Our principal brick competitors are Pingdingshan Zhengrui Industry Co, Ltd., and Pingdingshan Yinghao Building Materials Co., Ltd.  Our principal concrete competitors are Pingdingshan Xinruiqi Concrete Co., Ltd., and Pingdingshan Shijixing Concrete Co., Ltd. We have one competitor for recycled bricks, Pingdingshan Fuxing Modern Building Materials Co., Ltd., and no competitor for recycled aggregates or for hauling services within the areas where we have exclusive rights.
 
Competitors having lower operating costs than we do or having the financial resources to enable them to accept lower margins than we do will have a competitive advantage over us.  Competitors having greater financial resources or less financial leverage than we do may be able to invest more in production equipment or pay for acquisitions which could provide them a competitive advantage over us.  See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—Competition in Pingdingshan’s building and construction materials industry could adversely affect our results of operations.”
 
Seasonality
 
Our fiscal third quarter sales and results of operations are usually lower than other quarters due to the general slowdown in business activities in China during the Chinese New Year period.  See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—Our operating results may vary significantly from one reporting period to another and may be adversely affected by the seasonal and cyclical nature of the markets we serve.”

Regulations
 
This section summarizes the principal current PRC laws and regulations relevant to our business and operations.
 
Qualification of Construction Enterprise
 
According to the Construction Law of PRC issued by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on November 1, 1997, effective on March 1, 1998, and as amended on April 22, 2011, building construction enterprises, survey units, design units and project supervision units that engage in building operations shall have the following qualifications: (1) a registered capital conforming to state provisions; (2) specialized technical personnel with qualifications for legal operations that commensurate with the building operations being engaged in; (3) technical equipment for engaging in related building operations; and (4) other qualifications as may be prescribed by laws and administrative regulations. In addition, building construction enterprises, survey units, design units and project supervision units that engage in building operations shall be classified into different grades of quality in accordance with such quality qualifications as the registered capital, specialized technical personnel, technical equipment in their possession and achievements in construction projects completed, and may engage in building operations within the scope permitted by their respective quality grades on acquisition of the corresponding grade quality certificates upon passing qualification examination.
 
Pursuant to the Administration Rules Regarding Qualification of Construction Enterprise issued by Ministry of Construction of PRC on June 26, 2007, and effective on September 1, 2007, a construction enterprise may conduct its construction business after the receipt of qualification which is classified into three categories, with each category having several grades. Since the new Standard Regarding Qualification of Construction Enterprise became effective on January 1, 2015, however, pre-mix concrete will no longer be graded. Yulong Concrete’s Qualification Certificate for Construction Enterprise issued by Henan Province Housing and Urban and Rural Development Bureau will remain in effect until a new certificate can be issued under the new standard by the end of 2015.
 
Road Transportation Operation Permit
 
Pursuant to The Regulation of the People’s Republic of China on Road Transport issued by the State Council on April 14, 2004 and effective on July 1, 2004, an applicant who conducts road freight business shall meet the following conditions: (A) to have tested and qualified vehicles which are adapting to its business operation; (B) to employ drivers who have satisfied the conditions under this regulation; (C) to have a proper and heath safety management system. The governmental agency issues Road Transportation Operation Permit for the entity which is engaging in road freight business. Yulong Transport’s Road Transportation Operation Permit is currently valid through December 27, 2017.
New Energy Policy
 
On January 1, 2013, the State Council issued Notification for Twelfth Five Year Plan on Energy Development, or the New Energy Policy, the basic principles of which are establishing the priority of the country as conservation, being domestically oriented, diversification, environmental protection, reform in depth, technology innovation, international cooperation and improvement of the people’s livelihood. The New Energy Policy aims to control both the efficiency and amount of energy consumption. Total energy consumption for 2015 is set at 4 billion metric tons of coal and 6,150 billion kilowatts of electricity, and the rate of consumption per GDP is set at 16% less than that in 2010. In order to improve energy conservation, energy saving construction practices will be enforced, and green building standards, evaluation and certification will be promoted.

The New Energy Policy imposes production limits on some of our raw materials in order to control pollution generated by their production, which as a result has created both shortage and price increase of the affected raw materials, such as quicklime and cement.    As long as we can maintain our relationship with our current suppliers and are willing to pay the prevailing market price (or higher), we believe that the shortage can be overcome. However, we may choose not to do so in order to protect our margins. Because the implementation of the New Energy Policy is nationwide, we do not believe that sourcing raw materials from outside Pingdingshan would be practicable, in addition to uncertainty with the quality of raw materials from such suppliers and potential harm to our reputation. We expect that the New Energy Policy to have ongoing impact on our business and our industry until China’s pollution can be better controlled.
 
In late March 2016, the central government of the People’s of Republic of China passed Air Pollution Control Act and enforced Air Pollution Control Action Plan. The province of Henan of People’s Republic of China implemented “Province of Henan Blue Sky Action Plan” on various industries such as construction materials, coal mining. Due to this regulation and action plan, Yulong Renewable’s operation and its construction projects have been hindered. The Company has assessed the impact of this new regulations on its financial conditions. See “Item 7- Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial conditions and Results of Operations and Item 8-Financial Statements.”
 
Regulations on Tax
 
On March 16, 2007, the National People’s Congress, the PRC legislature, enacted the Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the Enterprise Income Tax Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008, and on December 6, 2007, the State Council promulgated the Implementation Rules to the Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the Implementation Rules, which also became effective on January 1, 2008.  Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law and the Implementation Rules, unless otherwise specified, foreign invested enterprises and domestic companies are subject to a uniform income tax rate of 25%.  In addition, the dividends payable to foreign investors are subject to PRC withholding tax at the rate of 10% unless the foreign investor’s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with the PRC that provides for a reduced withholding tax rate.  According to the Hong Kong Tax Treaty, a company incorporated in Hong Kong, will be subject to withholding income tax at a rate of 5% on dividends it receives from its PRC subsidiary if it holds a 25% or more interest in that particular PRC subsidiary.  However, the SAT promulgated Circular 601 and Announcement 30, which provide that tax treaty benefits will be denied to “conduit” or shell companies without business substance, and a beneficial ownership analysis will be used based on a “substance-over-the-form” principle to determine whether or not to grant tax treaty benefits. Therefore, it is unclear at this stage whether the reduced rate of 5% under the Hong Kong Tax Treaty could apply to dividends from Yulong WFOE paid to us through our Hong Kong subsidiary.  See “Risk Factors—Risk Factors Related to Regulations Applicable to Us—We may not be able to obtain certain treaty benefits on dividends paid by our PRC subsidiary to us through our Hong Kong subsidiary.”
 
The Enterprise Income Tax Law created a new “resident enterprise” classification which if applied could treat our Cayman Islands holding company or any of our other overseas holding companies in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes.  We believe that none of Yulong and its subsidiaries outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. Yulong is not controlled by a PRC enterprise or PRC enterprise group and as such we do not believe that Yulong meets all of the conditions to be deemed a PRC resident enterprise. For the same reasons, we believe our other subsidiaries outside of China are not PRC resident enterprises either. In addition, we are not aware of any offshore holding companies with a similar corporate structure to ours ever having been deemed a PRC “resident enterprise” by the PRC tax authorities. However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term “de facto management body.”
 
If the PRC tax authorities determine that our Cayman Islands holding company or any of our other overseas holding companies is a “resident enterprise” for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow.  One example is the possibility of a 10% withholding tax being imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC enterprise shareholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC enterprise shareholders from transferring our shares. See “Risk Factors—Risk Factors Related to Doing Business in China— Our global income and the dividends that we may receive from our PRC subsidiary, dividends distributed to our non-PRC shareholders, and gains recognized by such shareholders, may be subject to PRC taxes under the Enterprise Income Tax Law, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.”
 
Regulations on Foreign Exchange
 
Foreign exchange activities in China are primarily governed by the following regulations:
 

● | Foreign Exchange Administration Rules (1996), as amended in August 2008, or the Exchange Rules; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Administration Rules on the Settlement, Sale and Payment in Foreign Exchange (1996), or the Administration Rules. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Under the Administration Rules, if documents certifying the purposes of the conversion of RMB into foreign currency are submitted to the relevant foreign exchange conversion bank, the RMB will be convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest and royalties payments, and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions.  Conversion of RMB for capital account items, such as direct investment, loans, securities investment and repatriation of investment, however, is subject to the approval of, or registration with, SAFE or its local counterpart.  Capital investments by PRC entities outside of China, after obtaining the required approvals of the relevant approval authorities, such as the Ministry of Commerce and the National Development and Reform Commission or their local counterparts, are also required to register with SAFE or its local counterpart.
 

13
--

 

Under the Administration Rules, foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell and/or remit foreign currencies at banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business after providing valid commercial documents and, in the case of capital account item transactions, obtaining approval from or being registered with SAFE or its local counterpart.
 
In July 2015, we completed the process to increase the registered capital of Yulong WFOE from $100,000 to $10 million, and have contributed the net proceeds from our initial public offering of our ordinary shares to Yulong WFOE as a capital contribution. As such, the funds are available to support the operations of our consolidated affiliated entities.
 
On March 30, 2015, SAFE issued the Circular on the Reform of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 19, which became effective on June 1, 2015. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 19, foreign-invested enterprises may either continue to follow the payment-based foreign currency settlement system under the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, which has been replaced by SAFE Circular 19, or elect to follow the “conversion-at-will” of foreign currency settlement system. Where a foreign-invested enterprise follows the conversion-at-will of foreign currency settlement system, it may convert any or 100% amount of the foreign currency in its capital account into RMB at any time. The converted RMB will be kept in a designated account known as “Settled but Pending Payment Account,” and if the foreign-invested enterprise needs to make further payment from such designated account, it still needs to provide supporting documents and go through the review process with its bank. In addition, foreign-invested enterprises shall not use its capital and RMB obtained from foreign exchange settlement for purposes within the following negative list: (a) directly or indirectly for expenditures outside of its business scope or expenditures prohibited by national laws and regulations; (b) directly or indirectly for investment in securities, except as otherwise prescribed by applicable laws and regulations; (c) directly or indirectly for the disbursing RMB entrusted loans (other than as permitted in its business scope); (d) for repayment of inter-corporate borrowings (including money advanced by third parties) and the repayment of certain RMB bank loans that have been sub-lent to third parties; and (e) for the expenditures related to the purchase of real estate which is not for self-use, unless it is a foreign-invested real estate enterprise.
 
We expect that if we convert the net proceeds from our initial public offering into RMB pursuant to SAFE Circular 19, our use of RMB funds will be within the approved business scope of our PRC subsidiary.  Since Circular 19 was only recently promulgated, however, there are uncertainties on how it will be interpreted and implemented in practice.
 
Regulations on Dividend Distribution
 
The principal regulations governing dividend distributions of wholly foreign-owned enterprises include:
 

● | the Company Law (2013 Amendment); 
--+--------------------------------------


● | the Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law (2000 Amendment); and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law Implementing Rules (2001 Amendment). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Under these regulations, wholly foreign-owned enterprises in the PRC may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations.  In addition, these wholly foreign-owned enterprises are required to set aside at least 10% of their respective accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds, until the aggregate amount of such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital.
 
Regulations on Offshore Investment by PRC Residents
 
On July 14, 2014, SAFE issued the SAFE Circular Relating to Foreign Exchange Administration of Offshore Investment, Financing and Return Investment by Domestic Residents Utilizing Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular No. 37. SAFE Circular No. 37 repeals and replaces SAFE’s Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents to Engage in Financing and Inbound Investment via Overseas Special Purpose Vehicles, generally known as SAFE Circular No. 75, which had been the governing rule for nearly a decade.
 
Under SAFE Circular No. 37, (a) a PRC citizen who holds a PRC identification card, military identification or armed police identification, and offshore individual who does not have legal PRC identification papers but habitually resides in the PRC for economic interests, who is referred to as a domestic resident individual in SAFE Circular No. 37, can form a special purpose vehicle, or SPV, before registration with the SAFE but shall not make any capital contribution before completing the initial foreign exchange registration; (b) when the domestic resident individual contributes the assets of, or his or her equity interests in, a domestic enterprise into a SPV, or engages in overseas financing after contributing assets or equity interests into the SPV, such domestic resident individual shall register his or her interest in the SPV and the change thereof with the local branch of SAFE; and (c) when the SPV undergoes a material event outside of China, such as change in share capital, merger or division, the domestic resident individual shall register such change with the local branch of SAFE in a timely manner.  
 

14

Under SAFE Circular No. 37, failure to comply with the registration procedures above may result in penalties, including imposition of a fine of up to RMB 50,000 against a domestic resident individual. In addition, to the extent that any capital inflow or outflow resulted from such irregularities, SAFE may order rectification of such misconduct (including the return of such amount to China if there is a capital outflow) or impose a fine up to an amount equal to the amount of capital inflow or outflow. In the event of a capital outflow, criminal liability may be imposed if the related violation is severe.
 
Labor Laws and Social Insurance
 
Pursuant to the PRC Labor Law and the PRC Labor Contract Law, employers must execute written labor contracts with full-time employees. All employers must compensate their employees with wages equal to at least the local minimum wage standards. All employers are required to establish a system for labor safety and sanitation, strictly abide by state rules and standards and provide employees with workplace safety training.
 
In addition, under the PRC Labor Contract Law, an employee shall be paid severance pay based on the number of years worked with his or her employer at the rate of one month’s wage for each full year worked. Any period of more than six months but less than one year shall be counted as one year. Any period of less than six months shall be paid with half of the monthly wage. If the monthly wage of an employee is three times greater than the average monthly wage of employees as published by the people’s government at the level of municipality directly under the central government or municipality divided into districts where the employer is located, the severance pay rate shall be three times the average monthly wage of employees, provided that no more than 12 years of work shall be paid. The term “monthly wage” shall mean the employee’s average monthly wage for the 12 months prior to the termination or ending of his or her employment contract.
 
Violations of the PRC Labor Contract Law and the PRC Labor Law may result in the imposition of fines and other administrative liabilities. Criminal liability may arise for serious violations.
 
In addition, employers in China are obliged to provide employees with welfare schemes covering pension insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance, work-related injury insurance, medical insurance and housing funds.
 
Regulations on Overseas Listing
 
In August 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies jointly adopted the Provisions on the Merger and Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rule.  As amended in 2009, this rule requires that, if an overseas company established or controlled by PRC domestic companies or citizens intends to acquire equity interests or assets of any other PRC domestic company affiliated with the PRC domestic companies or citizens, such acquisition must be submitted to the Ministry of Commerce, rather than local regulators, for approval.  In addition, this regulation requires that an overseas company controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or citizens and holding equity interests of PRC domestic companies needs to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to listing its securities on an overseas stock exchange.
 
While the application of the M&A Rule remains unclear, based on their understanding of current PRC laws, regulations, and additional procedures announced by the CSRC on September 21, 2006, our PRC counsel has advised us that we are not required to submit an application to the CSRC for its approval of the listing and trading of our ordinary shares on the NASDAQ Capital Market on the basis that:
 

● | the CSRC currently has not issued any definitive rule or interpretation concerning whether offerings like our initial public offering are subject to this regulation; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | no provision in this regulation clearly classified contractual arrangements as a type of transaction subject to its regulation. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If, conversely, it is determined that CSRC approval is required, we may face sanctions by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies for failure to seek CSRC approval prior to completing our initial public offering in July 2015.  These sanctions may include fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, delays or restrictions on the repatriation into the PRC of the proceeds from our initial public offering, restrictions on or prohibition of the payments or remittance of dividends by our PRC subsidiary, or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our ordinary shares.  See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—The approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission may be required in connection with our initial public offering under a regulation adopted in August 2006, and, if required, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such approval.”

Regulations on Concentration in Merger and Acquisition Transactions
 
The M&A Rule established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex.  These rules require, among other things, that the Ministry of Commerce be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor will take control of a PRC domestic enterprise or a foreign company with substantial PRC operations, if certain thresholds under the Provisions on Thresholds for Prior Notification of Concentrations of Undertakings issued by the State Council on August 3, 2008 are triggered.
 
Complying with these requirements could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share.  See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—Certain regulations in the PRC may make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions.”
