BUSINESS OVERVIEW
GCP Applied Technologies Inc. produces and sells specialty construction chemicals, specialty building materials and packaging sealants and coatings through three global operating segments in which we have achieved leadership positions. Specialty Construction Chemicals manufactures and markets concrete admixtures, which enhance the properties of concrete and other cementitious construction materials, and cement additives, which improve the performance of Portland cement, the most widely used construction material in the world. Specialty Building Materials manufactures and markets building envelope, residential building, and specialty construction products that protect structures from water, vapor transmission, air penetration, and fire damage. Darex Packaging Technologies manufactures and markets sealants and coatings that safeguard the packaging materials and preserve the contents of beverage and food containers and other consumer and industrial applications.
GCP Applied Technologies Inc. was incorporated on May 1, 2015 for the purpose of holding the construction products and packaging technologies businesses of W. R. Grace & Co. On February 3, 2016, Grace shareholders received one common share of GCP for every one common share of Grace held and the construction products and packaging technologies businesses of Grace were transferred to GCP, thereby completing our legal separation from Grace ("the Separation"). On February 4, 2016, we began "regular way" trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "GCP."
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had net sales of $1.4 billion, income before income taxes of $106.0 million and net income of $72.8 million. Approximately 60% of our 2016 sales were generated outside the United States and we operate in approximately 35 countries.
Strategy Overview
Our objective is to deliver value to shareholders by growing our sales, earnings, cash flow, and return on invested capital through the implementation of our business strategies.

SCC consists of two product groups: concrete admixtures and cement additives.
Concrete admixtures
The concrete admixtures product group includes concrete admixtures, admixtures for decorative concrete and concrete production management systems.
Concrete admixtures allow concrete producers to use a limited selection of locally-sourced raw materials (cement and aggregates) to produce concrete to meet a wide variety of performance specifications. Our products are based on a set of core platform technologies formulated regionally into admixtures tailored to local end-use requirements. For example, our MIRA® admixtures allow concrete to be produced with a lower amount of water, which improves the compressive strength and the long-term durability of the concrete. ADVA® admixtures are used to make flowable "self-compacting concrete" which is popular in precast concrete manufacturing where the rapid filling of large molds is a major driver of economics. ECLIPSE® admixtures are used to minimize the formation of shrinkage cracks in critical applications, such as bridge decks. STRUX® polymeric fibers are designed to improve the ductility of concrete which is a naturally brittle material. In some cases, STRUX® polymeric fibers may be used to replace steel reinforcement near the surface of concrete that will be exposed to corrosive de-icing salts.
Admixtures for decorative concrete are used to create decorative/architectural concrete. PIERI® surface retarders are used to obtain exposed aggregate finishes in precast and cast-in-place concrete, achieving the desired surface appearance. PIERI® release agents allow for the efficient removal of mold forms with a resultant blemish-free concrete surface.
Concrete production management systems provide sophisticated process monitoring and control while concrete is in transit to the jobsite. Our patented concrete production management system, sold under the VERIFI® brand name, measures, monitors and manages critical concrete properties and systematically adds water or admixtures to maintain optimum concrete flow properties. The result is increased product quality and consistency of concrete, fewer rejected loads, increased jobsite efficiency and minimized costly project delays.
Cement additives
Portland cement is the binding agent for concrete. National standards usually dictate the compressive strength and other properties that must be met by cement. Cement additives are used to reduce the energy required to mill cement to the desired fineness and to improve the handling characteristics of the powdered material. These products are also used to adjust the performance of Portland cement, permitting our customers to optimize production economics. Examples include HEA2® Cement Additives, which are used around the world to improve the energy efficiency of cement grinding operations and CBA® Cement Additives, which are used to produce higher cement strength, providing a high level of process flexibility to the cement manufacturer. Increasingly, cement manufacturers seek to reduce the environmental impact of their manufacturing processes; our additives provide greater flexibility in raw materials, enabling customers to achieve improvements such as reductions in energy use and CO2 emissions.

SBM consists of three product groups: building envelope, residential building products and specialty construction products.
Building envelope products
Building envelope products protect structures from water and help manage air and vapor transmission through building walls. The majority of sales in this product group are waterproofing products that protect commercial structures, residential structures and infrastructure. Our waterproofing products are used in both above-grade and below-grade applications. Above grade, our products protect the material to which they are applied and allow architects to design occupied spaces free from water infiltration, and below grade, our products enable the construction of structures in challenging sites, including portions below the existing water table. Examples of these products include our self-adhesive rubberized asphalt membrane, BITUTHENE® and our innovative pre-applied sheet membrane, PREPRUFE®. 
Our BITUTHENE® product line is manufactured globally and has a long track record of providing waterproofing in the most challenging conditions. Designers and contractors have relied on BITUTHENE® for over 40 years and continue to specify it by name. We pioneered the pre-applied waterproofing category with our Advanced Bond Technology™ found in PREPRUFE®. Our unique technology allows a waterproofing membrane to be installed on the ground or on walls before concrete is placed for a foundation. This technology also allows waterproofing of walls normally inaccessible during the construction of a building, such as foundations in densely populated cities. Major projects around the world have successfully implemented our PREPRUFE® system and it continues to gain recognition for its waterproofing performance.
Residential building products
Residential building products consist of roofing underlayments, flashing and weather barriers. Roofing underlayments are placed below the outermost roof covering, such as shingles, to protect sloped roofs from water damage caused by wind-driven rain and ice dams. ICE & WATER SHIELD® roofing underlayments are known throughout the industry and are sold in North America through a network of distributors. The VYCOR® flashing portfolio consists of high performance self-adhered flashing products that provide premium protection against water infiltration in critical areas such as windows and doors. VYCOR® flashing reduces the risk of mold and rot development and contributes to energy efficiency by sealing air leakages from the building.

Specialty Construction Chemicals and Specialty Building Materials
We utilize internal and third party manufacturing to produce our products to our specifications. Our low capital intensive plants along with third-party manufacturers provide us with flexibility in servicing our customers. Several of our plants ship internationally but most of our facilities are positioned to serve local market demand. We have the ability to respond quickly to changes in local demand by establishing or expanding manufacturing capacity with low capital investment. With both vendors and customers, we have numerous multi-year supply and purchasing agreements which help to minimize volume disruption. Construction demand is seasonal resulting in demand variations requiring effective management of our manufacturing and distribution assets. For many of our SCC customers, we install and maintain a chemical dispensing and storage system for our products at their production facilities. We periodically replenish the on-site systems to give our customers instant access to our SCC products in the amounts they require twenty-four hours a day. We also install equipment on ready-mix trucks to monitor and manage concrete in transit to job sites. This customer-based equipment accounted for 28% of our current annual capital spend.
The raw materials we use in our products are obtained from a variety of suppliers, including basic chemical and petrochemical producers. Many of our raw materials are organic chemicals derived from olefins, including specialty films and fibers. We also make significant purchases of inorganic materials such as gypsum and specialty materials, including papers, rubber and asphalt. We have multiple raw material sources and balance our purchasing requirements between local and global sources seeking to maximize performance and profitability. Global supply and demand factors, changes in currency exchange rates and petroleum prices can significantly impact the price of our key raw materials.
Our global supply chain team monitors the global market to identify cost and productivity opportunities. We seek to leverage our overall purchasing volumes for all regions. Since we manufacture a portion of our products in emerging regions using raw materials from suppliers in the U.S., Europe and other advanced economies, changes in the values of the currencies of these emerging regions versus the U.S. dollar and the euro may adversely affect our raw material costs. This effect is partially mitigated by our reliance on local sourcing for some raw materials.
The construction business is cyclical, in response to economic conditions, as well as seasonal, driven by weather conditions. Demand for our products is primarily driven by global non-residential and infrastructure construction activity and U.S. residential construction activity. We seek to increase profitability and minimize the impact of cyclical downturns in regional economies by introducing technically advanced high-performance products and expanding geographically.
Darex Packaging Technologies
Our packaging products are manufactured by a network of globally integrated plants that are positioned to service our customers regionally. Our packaging products are manufactured in both large facilities to permit economies of scale and a network of smaller operations that enable customization to local conditions.
The principal raw materials for Darex products include resins, solvents, latexes (including certain food-grade raw materials), polyolefins, pigments and rubber. Multiple suppliers are generally available for each of these materials; however, some of our raw materials may be provided by single sources of supply. We seek to mitigate the risk of using single source suppliers by identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers or, for unique materials, by using alternative formulations from other suppliers. In some instances, we produce our own raw materials and intermediates.
Prices for many of our raw materials, including specialty and commodity materials such as latex, rubbers, pigments, resins and solvents, can be volatile. We generally take actions to mitigate the effect of changes in raw material cost, including increasing our product prices, developing alternative formulations for our products, increasing productivity and entering into supply agreements for certain raw materials.
Since we manufacture a substantial portion of our products in emerging regions using raw materials supplied from the U.S., Europe and other advanced economies, changes in the values of these currencies may adversely affect our raw material costs. This effect is partially mitigated by our reliance on local sourcing for many of our raw materials.

The global marketing resources that we believe are essential to a successful product development process are also located with our research and development group in Cambridge. 
Technologies developed by our Global Technology Center are customized for each region and supported in the field by a network of Regional Technical Centers including facilities in Sorocaba, Brazil; Singapore; Beijing, China; Atsugi, Japan; Epernon, France; Lügde, Germany; Norderstedt, Germany; and Heist, Belgium. 
Globally, we have over 400 research and development and technical service employees and approximately 11% of our workforce is focused on technology. We believe the collective technical expertise, industry knowledge and professionalism of this team is a significant differentiator for us.
We file patent applications globally on a routine basis and obtain grants in numerous countries around the world in support of our products, formulations, manufacturing processes, equipment and improvements. We also benefit from technological and commercial advantages protected under trade secret laws, including know-how and other proprietary information related to many of our products, technologies and internal quality control and testing methodologies. Entering 2017, we have approximately 900 active patents and patent applications pending in countries around the world, including approximately 160 in the U.S. During the past five years, we have averaged approximately 65 patent applications per year globally. The average number of patents filed and granted could go up or down from year to year, depending on various factors, some of which may not be within our control. It is our intent to continue to file for patents to protect our proprietary innovations and investments in research.
Research and development expenses were approximately $23 million in 2016, $22 million in 2015 and $28 million in 2014. These amounts include depreciation and amortization expenses related to research and development assets and expenses incurred in funding external research projects. The amount of research and development expenses relating to government- and customer- sponsored projects (rather than projects that we sponsor) was not material during these periods.

ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS
We are subject, along with other manufacturers of specialty chemicals, to stringent regulations under numerous U.S. federal, state and local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, discharge, disposition and stewardship of hazardous wastes and other materials. Environmental laws require that certain responsible parties, as defined in the relevant statute, fund remediation actions regardless of legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. We are involved in remediation actions to address hazardous wastes or other materials as required by U.S. federal, state and local and foreign laws. 
We continuously seek to improve our environment, health and safety performance. We have expended funds to comply with environmental laws and regulations and expect to continue to do so in the future. 
EMPLOYEE RELATIONS
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 2,900 employees, of which approximately 800 were employed in the United States. Of our total employees, approximately 2,400 were salaried and 500 were hourly.
Approximately 85 of our manufacturing employees in the United States are represented by five different local collective bargaining groups. We have operated without a labor work stoppage for more than 10 years.
We have works councils representing the majority of our European sites covering approximately 150 employees.
