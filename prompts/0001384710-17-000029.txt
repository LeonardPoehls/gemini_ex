Item 1.    Business
General
Monogram Residential Trust, Inc. (which, together with its subsidiaries as the context requires, may be referred to as the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” or “Monogram”) was organized in Maryland on August 4, 2006. We are a fully integrated self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that invests in, develops and operates high quality multifamily communities offering location and lifestyle amenities. Our principal financial goal is to increase long-term shareholder value through the operation, acquisition and development of our multifamily communities and, when appropriate, the disposition of multifamily communities in our portfolio. We plan to achieve our financial goal by allocating capital in urban, suburban-urban and high-density suburban growth markets, with a high quality, diversified portfolio that is professionally managed. We invest in stabilized operating communities and communities in various phases of development, with a focus on communities in select markets across the United States. These include luxury high-rise, mid-rise and garden style multifamily communities.  Our targeted communities include existing “core” communities, which we define as communities that are already stabilized and producing rental income, as well as communities in various phases of development, redevelopment, lease up or repositioning with the intent to transition those communities to core communities. As of December 31, 2016, Monogram's portfolio includes investments in 51 multifamily communities in 10 states comprising 14,473 residential units. 
Our investments may be wholly owned by us or held through joint venture arrangements with third-party investors, which we define as “Co-Investment Ventures” or “CO-JVs.”  These are predominately equity investments but may also include debt investments, consisting of mezzanine or bridge loans. 
At December 31, 2016, we held ownership interests in:
Equity investments

• | 47 operating multifamily communities (including one development in lease up) containing 13,022 residential units in 10 states, all of which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. Of the 47 operating multifamily communities, 35 are held by CO-JVs. 


• | two developments of multifamily communities for 656 residential units in two states, both of which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and held by CO-JVs.

Debt investments

• | two loan investments for the development of multifamily communities.


We target locations in primary markets and coastal regions with high job and rent growth, including transit-oriented locations and vibrant areas offering lifestyle and retail amenities, and class A communities that are newer and highly amenitized with higher rents per unit for the submarket. Class A communities, where the rents are higher than the median for the submarket, have historically provided greater long-term total returns than class B communities. Also, newer communities, with updated amenities and less capital and maintenance expenditures, have historically provided greater long-term total returns than older communities. Further, because markets move in and out of favor, we mitigate our exposure to any given submarket by investing in a geographically diversified portfolio. As of December 31, 2016, our primary markets include Northern California, Southern California, New England, Mid-Atlantic, South Florida, Colorado, and Texas, representing 90% of the portfolio as measured by our number of units.

We continuously review our portfolio and primary markets for long-term growth prospects, scale and operating efficiencies and expect to continue to reposition and redeploy capital to improve long-term returns. Currently certain of our markets are experiencing oversupply from new development, which is resulting in rental concessions and decelerating income growth. Some of these are in non-coastal markets, where we may decide to permanently or temporarily exit the markets. That was the case in 2015 when we exited Chicago. 
Substantially all of our business is conducted through our operating partnership, Monogram Residential OP LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). Our wholly owned subsidiary, Monogram Residential, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“MR Inc.”), owns less than 0.1% of the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner. The remaining ownership interest in the Operating Partnership is held as a limited partner's interest by our wholly owned subsidiary, MR Business Trust, a Maryland business trust. As of December 31, 2016, the Operating Partnership has not issued any ownership interests to any noncontrolling interests in a so-called “UPREIT Structure,” but is organized in a manner that may facilitate an UPREIT Structure if advantageous to us in the future. 
We have elected to be taxed, and currently qualify, as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to corporate-level income taxes. To maintain our REIT status, we are required, among other requirements, to distribute annually at least 90% of our “REIT taxable income,” as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. As of December 31, 2016, we believe we are in compliance with all applicable REIT requirements.
Our office is located at 5800 Granite Parkway, Suite 1000, Plano, Texas 75024, and our telephone number is (469) 250-5500. 
Our shares of common stock have traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “MORE” since November 21, 2014. 
Further discussion of our acquisition, development, disposition, co-investment, property management, financing and other strategies follows.
Acquisition Strategy 
We focus on acquiring multifamily communities that we believe will produce increasing rental revenue and appreciate in value over our holding period. Our targeted acquisitions include existing core communities, as well as communities in various phases of development and lease up with the intent to transition those communities to core communities. Acquisitions provide us with immediate entries into markets, allowing more rapid earnings growth and rebalancing of our portfolio of assets than development investments. To date, we have made investments in individual multifamily communities. In the future, we plan to continue investing in individual multifamily communities and may pursue acquisitions of portfolios or other transactions. To date, all of our acquisitions have been for cash but as discussed above, we may acquire in an “UPREIT structure” or issue shares of our common stock. Also, as discussed below, we may also acquire interests through Co-Investment Ventures. 
We invest in high quality communities in high barrier coastal markets, which have long-term diversified economic drivers. We may also invest in selected growth markets that have high job and rent growth fundamentals, such as Dallas, Austin, Houston, Denver and Atlanta. These markets may change over time as local market fundamentals change, particularly trends in demand/supply, rental growth and operating expenses. Within these markets, we primarily focus on urban, suburban-urban and high-density suburban areas with higher paying jobs, convenient transportation, retail and other lifestyle amenities. These target locations are typically in infill sites, which may include urban and suburban-urban areas, and are generally high density, lifestyle submarkets with walkable locations, near public mass transportation and employment. We believe these locations attract affluent renters, who are generally older than the typical renter demographic, and who tend to experience lower turnover and are subject to less price elasticity.
We may also incorporate into our investment portfolio lease up communities, generally recently completed multifamily developments that have not started or have just started leasing, which may provide for better pricing relative to stabilized assets and a more timely realization of operating cash flow than traditional development projects. Generally, we make additional non-recurring and revenue enhancing capital improvements to aesthetically improve the community and its amenities, when it allows us to increase rents, and stabilize occupancy with the goal of increasing yield and improving total returns.

We have internal acquisition professionals who source acquisition opportunities through relationships with local owners and brokers. Our investment process then follows established procedures that we believe are effective in evaluating the potential investment returns and underwrite the potential benefits and risks on an absolute basis and as compared to other investment options. Major factors that we consider include the macroeconomic growth fundamentals for the market, existing and projected operations, current and future cash flow, our ability to add or increase other revenue sources, existing and projected supply of competing communities, the effective operating age, the quality of construction and the attractiveness of the surrounding submarket. We also consider the synergies of the investment with our existing portfolio, including efficiencies with respect to our other investments in the market and whether we believe we will be able to hold a sufficient critical mass to optimize property management.
Development Strategy
We invest in developments where we believe we can create value and cash flow greater than through stabilized investments on a risk adjusted basis. We seek developments with characteristics similar to our stabilized multifamily investments, but at a lower cost per unit and in locations where there are limited acquisition opportunities. Our developments also allow us to build a portfolio that is tailored to our specifications for location with the latest amenities and operational efficiencies, which result in lower capital expenditures and maintenance costs. Investing in developments further allows us to maintain a younger portfolio. 
We have in-house development capabilities which include the expertise to execute developments on our own or through third-party developers, which may include strategic joint ventures with national or regional real estate developers and owners (“Developer Partners”). When we utilize third-party developers, we expect to be the controlling owner, partnering with experienced developers, but maintaining control over construction, operations, financing and disposition. Similar to our acquisition strategy, utilizing local developers, rather than establishing our own regional offices, provides us with a broader and more scalable approach to sourcing and executing developments with less fixed overhead. Our developer arrangements also generally include guaranteed maximum construction contracts (“GMAX”) which helps us manage our development and construction risks. However, whether developed in-house or through third-party developers, we maintain direct involvement in the development of each project in order to ensure that the finished product is suitable as a long-term investment and includes the kinds of upgrades that provide energy and operational efficiencies. 
In selecting development investment opportunities, we generally focus on sites that are already entitled and environmentally assessed. While entitled land carries a higher upfront cost, acquiring ready to develop land significantly shortens the development time cycle, and reduces the associated carrying costs and exposure to materials and labor cost escalations as well as the development risks. Because of our approach to development as described above, the average time from closing on the land to the start of vertical construction for these development projects has historically averaged approximately six months. As of December 31, 2016, all of our current developments are entitled. 
Similar to acquisitions, our development underwriting evaluates investments on a risk adjusted basis. We seek development opportunities that provide sufficient yield spreads at stabilization to the yields for acquisitions to account for the additional development risks as well as total returns that are accretive relative to our portfolio and cost of capital. In many cases, recent cost increases have compressed development spreads as compared to acquisitions and in many cases core urban developments, particularly outside of the west coast, are generating lower risk adjusted returns. We will continue to pursue development opportunities in our target markets if the opportunities meet our risk adjusted return expectations and align with our portfolio and capital allocation plans.
We engage reputable and experienced general contractors, architects and other design professionals for our development projects. Our development team monitors each project’s progress in order to ensure that our projects achieve the high quality of construction consistent with our targeted resident profile, and are generally completed on time and in line with budget. Our process is also predicated on securing GMAX construction contracts that are based upon complete plans and specifications, rather than design build where plans are finalized during construction. This not only reduces our exposure to cost overruns but also encourages our general contractors to lock in construction costs by buying out the underlying materials and subcontractors as soon as practicable. As of December 31, 2016, for our remaining projects under vertical development, substantially all of the hard construction costs have been bought out, reducing potential future cost exposure. Our development process further coordinates with property management to ensure a smooth and seamless transition into leasing and operations. 
 Disposition Strategy
We continuously evaluate total return, net operating performance and growth prospects for our investments and markets as compared to alternative investments, and will sell assets and redeploy capital, reduce leverage or return capital to 
5

our shareholders as warranted. Other factors we consider include the critical mass of our operating communities in the market, overall fundamentals for the market and the age of the multifamily community. We may look to dispose of communities before major capital improvements are required, as well as when we see increasing risk of competition, changing submarket fundamentals and/or in consideration of compliance with applicable federal REIT tax requirements.
We have internal professionals who utilize relationships with local owners and brokers to source dispositions. Sales agreements generally provide for a due diligence period by the seller with an amount of earnest money that is binding at the completion of the due diligence period. 
In structuring dispositions, we consider various factors including federal REIT tax requirements, ownership and form of consideration. Accordingly, our dispositions may be structured as fee simple transactions, entity-level sales or like-kind tax exchanges, which generally involve using the proceeds to invest in other multifamily investments. We may also sell investments individually or in bulk. To date, all of our dispositions have been for cash, where we have not provided any seller financing. 
Co-Investment Strategy 
We enter into strategic Co-Investment Ventures with institutional investors which we believe offer efficient, cost effective capital for growth. This institutional investor capital generally does not carry priority or minimum returns and in some arrangements, we receive promoted interests if certain total returns are achieved. Equity from joint ventures allows us to expand the number and size of our investments, allowing us to obtain a more diversified portfolio and participation in investments that we may otherwise have deemed disproportionately too large for our current portfolio. In addition, these joint ventures may provide a very cost effective internal source of growth or capital re-allocation, if we elect to purchase or sell all of our partner’s or our ownership interest in the underlying multifamily communities. Joint ventures also allow us to earn fees for asset management, development and property management, which offset portions of our general and administrative expenses. These institutional joint venture arrangements include relatively standard market distributable cash flow provisions and are structured so that we are the manager of the Co-Investment Venture subject to certain approval rights retained by our partners. 

We are the managing member for each of the separate Co-Investment Ventures. Our two institutional Co-Investment Venture partners are Stichting Depositary PGGM Private Real Estate Fund, a Dutch foundation acting in its capacity as depositary of and for the account and risk of PGGM Private Real Estate Fund and its affiliates, a real estate investment vehicle for Dutch pension funds (“PGGM” or the “PGGM Co-Investment Partner”), and Milky Way Partners, L.P. (the “MW Co-Investment Partner”), the primary partner of which is Korea Exchange Bank, as Trustee for and on behalf of National Pension Service (acting for and on behalf of the National Pension Fund of the Republic of Korea Government) (“NPS”). We refer to our Co-Investment Ventures with the PGGM Co-Investment Partner as “PGGM CO-JVs,” and those with the MW Co-Investment Partner as “MW CO-JVs.” 
As further explained in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our arrangements with PGGM provide for additional sources of capital, fees and promoted interests over the term of the joint venture. Accordingly, while we may sell certain PGGM CO-JVs or buyout PGGM’s CO-JV interest from time to time, in whole or in part, we expect to continue to enter into additional CO-JVs with PGGM. On the other hand, while our MW CO-JVs do provide fee income, some degree of operational efficiency and the possibility of purchasing their interests, they do not generally provide additional capital. Accordingly, we expect the aggregate number of our MW CO-JVs to decline over time as communities are sold or we buy out our partner’s ownership interest in the underlying multifamily communities.
 
When applicable, we refer to individual investments by referencing those with Developer Partners as “Developer CO-JVs.” Certain PGGM CO-JVs that also include Developer Partners are referred to as PGGM CO-JVs. We share with the PGGM Co-Investment Partner in all benefits and obligations of the Developer CO-JVs that are also PGGM CO-JVs.
We utilize Developer CO-JVs primarily for the Developer Partners’ development services, which allows us a cost effective structure to source and complete multifamily developments. In our structure, Developer Partners have limited initial capital investment, which is generally fully or partially reimbursed during the course of the development. The Developer Partners provide development cost overrun guarantees and receive back end interests that provide promoted payments once we (including PGGM in the case of a PGGM CO-JV) receive a return of all invested capital plus a preferred return. Developer Partners also generally have an option to put their developer interest at a fixed price after approximately one year after substantial completion. Developer CO-JVs generally also have mark to market options, usually only available after the seventh year after formation of the Developer CO-JV, which if elected by either party, would generally give us the option to purchase 
6

the Developer Partners interest or sell the underlying multifamily community. Accordingly, we generally do not consider Developer CO-JVs as a significant source of capital. 
The table below presents a summary of our Co-Investment Ventures as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.  The effective ownership ranges are based on our participation in distributable operating cash from our investment in the underlying multifamily community. This effective ownership is indicative of, but may differ over time from, percentages for distributions, contributions or financing requirements for each respective Co-Investment Venture. Unless otherwise noted, all of our Co-Investment Ventures are reported on the consolidated basis of accounting.

 | December 31, 2016 | December 31, 2015 
Co-Investment Structure | Number of Multifamily Communities | Our EffectiveOwnership | | Number of Multifamily Communities | | Our EffectiveOwnership
PGGM CO-JVs (a) | 21 | | 50% to 70% | | 23 | | 50% to 70%
MW CO-JVs | 14 | | 55% | | 14 | | 55% 
Developer CO-JVs | 2 | | 100% | | 2 | | 100% 
Total CO-JV Multifamily Communities (b) | 37 | | | | 39 | | 


(a) | As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the PGGM CO-JVs include Developer Partners in 18 multifamily communities.


(b) | Total investments in multifamily communities were 51 and 56 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Property Management Strategy 
We seek to achieve long-term earnings growth through our internal property management team and the strength of our operating platform. We execute this strategy by employing:

• | a focus on revenue management utilizing rent and occupancy optimization technology platforms;


• | a brand built on a “Tailored Living” experience, a boutique-style service platform that emphasizes the unique high- end nature of our communities while maintaining individual personality and characteristics of each local market and consistency in quality of resident experience; 


• | a capital improvement strategy that enhances revenues, reduces operating costs and maintains the quality of each community;


• | employment of business intelligence and performance analytics to measure and monitor key operating metrics; and


• | a high level of resident satisfaction as measured by third-party benchmarking, reputation management and resident feedback.

Our corporate property management team is comprised of multifamily industry veterans with local market expertise. On-site property management teams at all levels as well as regional supervisors are incentivized with bonus programs tied to revenue and expense performance results, resident satisfaction, and operating excellence metrics. 
Our web-based technology applications support our marketing platform by tracking resident prospects from first contact to lease, measuring effectiveness of generating traffic and closing, and providing on-line access to our customers 24/7 to lease apartments, execute renewals, submit service requests, make payments electronically and receive communications electronically.  Our on-site management personnel provide high quality service, responsiveness and maintenance to enhance the resident experience. These include concierge, package delivery systems, trash pick-up, social events, business centers, internet cafes and other tailored amenities.

Our comprehensive education and training platform contributes to the quality and consistency of operations at a national level and supports the development of bench strength on our team. 
Financing Strategy
The objective of our financing strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and provide liquidity to manage and grow the Company. We plan to achieve these objectives generally through limiting leverage as a percent of gross assets to not more than 55%, and utilizing secured and unsecured structures with an extended maturity ladder. We currently are meeting our short-term liquidity needs through our operating cash flow and borrowings under our credit facility. We currently expect to refinance our long-term debt and construction financings at or prior to their maturity dates at similar principal amounts. However, we will consider different structures, terms and maturities based on then current market pricing and availability. These structures could include single and pooled asset mortgages and debt facilities, which may be secured or unsecured. 
For our development program, we expect to utilize our credit facility and individual project construction financing, generally at 45% to 60% of cost either with conventional bank construction financing or longer term construction financing. Conventional construction financing is expected to be at floating rates which allow for greater flexibility in refinancing. The base terms of these construction borrowings typically extend through the projected stabilization of the development, which may include one or two 12 month extension options. We may also obtain longer term construction financing that would extend past the stabilization period, with terms of seven to 10 years, when we can lock in favorable financing. We do expect to have increased borrowings related to our development program, since most of our equity requirements have already been met, and we are now drawing down on our construction loans. All of our current developments have existing construction financing commitments, under which we expect to incur additional consolidated borrowings of approximately $100 million subsequent to December 31, 2016 to complete our development program. For these developments as well as future developments, we may also access other sources of capital, including existing cash balances, credit facility and new construction financings. Accordingly, our use of consolidated borrowings may change over time. 
Additionally, we may fund some of our future investments with Co-Investment Venture arrangements as discussed above. In addition to diversification and fee opportunities, our Co-Investment Ventures also allow us to preserve our capital while continuing to invest in and operate the portfolio. 
As a part of our long-term finance plans, we may consider other debt and equity offerings, refinancings and dispositions. In evaluating these options, we may consider our current and projected cost of equity versus debt, our debt maturity schedule, liquidity requirements and the other factors discussed above. 
Other Strategies and Activities
We may deploy other strategies to increase total returns and shareholder value. As with other investments, we evaluate whether these investments produce sufficient risk adjusted returns, are accretive to our cost of capital and are consistent with a strong balance sheet. Over the last few years, we saw an opportunity to invest in development mezzanine loans that were not being met by other capital providers, which provided annualized cash returns in excess of 14%. As development capital has generally returned to the multifamily sector, these investment opportunities have not been as readily available at the returns that we require. Accordingly, we generally expect our current outstanding mezzanine loans to be paid off near maturity and not replaced, or if they are, they may be replaced at lower levels than our current investments. 
2016 Highlights 
Key transactions and highlights for 2016 included: 

• | Increased total consolidated rental revenue by 17.9% from $238.1 million in 2015 to $280.7 million in 2016, and same store comparable total rental revenues for our multifamily communities by 2.3% from $188.9 million in 2015 to $193.3 million in 2016;


• | Our investment activity in 2016:


◦ | Sold two stabilized multifamily communities for a combined sales price of $122.6 million, before closing costs, resulting in consolidated gains on sales of real estate of $43.6 million;


◦ | Invested $97.0 million in our development program, completing construction of four developments with 1,103 units;


◦ | Achieved stabilization of five multifamily communities, increasing our total stabilized communities to 43;


• | Obtained $171.7 million in new permanent mortgage financing and new construction financing with a total commitment of $104.4 million;

8


• | Declared total distributions of $50.0 million, an annual rate of $0.30 per share ($0.075 per share on a quarterly basis); and


• | Reported net income for 2016 of $7.9 million, a decrease from 2015 reported net income of $66.7 million, where a substantial portion of the decrease related to decreased gains from sales of multifamily communities of $39.4 million. Funds from operations (“FFO”) decreased by 9.6% from $64.4 million in 2015 to $58.2 million in 2016. (See Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion regarding FFO, including reconciliations to net income in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)). 

Tax Status
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code and have qualified as a REIT since the year ended December 31, 2007. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax at the corporate level. We are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.
We utilize a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) to engage in activities that REITs may be prohibited from performing, including property and asset management and other services and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions. Our TRS is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership and is taxable as a regular corporation, and therefore, subject to federal, state and local income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our TRS did not recognize any significant income tax expense/(benefit) related to the taxable income of the TRS.
Competition 
We are subject to significant competition in seeking real estate investments, capital, including both equity and debt capital, and residents. We compete with many third parties engaged in real estate investment activities including other REITs, regional and national developers, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, hedge funds, governmental bodies and other entities. We also face competition from other real estate development, lending and investment programs for investments that may be suitable for us. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have. They also may have competitive advantages related to, among other things, cost of capital, governmental regulation, access to real estate investments and resident services.
Regulations
Our investments are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, construction and occupancy permits, construction codes, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts (such as increased motor vehicle activity), rent controls, business licenses and fair housing regulations. We believe that we have all permits, licenses and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments.
Environmental
As an owner and developer of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on communities in which we hold an interest, or on communities that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future.

Employees
As of January 31, 2017, we have 425 employees.
Industry Segment
Our current business consists of investing in, developing and operating multifamily communities. Substantially all of our consolidated net income is from multifamily communities and related investments that we wholly own or own through joint ventures. Our management evaluates operating performance on an individual property and/or joint venture level. However, as each of our wholly owned communities and joint ventures has similar economic characteristics, we are managed on an enterprise-wide basis with one reportable segment.
