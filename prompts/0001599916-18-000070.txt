Item 1. Business.
 
Nodechain, Inc.’s current business operations are comprised of activities revolving around the blockchain, with a particular emphasis on digital cryptocurrency mining and transaction validation.
 
The Company utilizes, at present, forty-five mining computers (rigs) that include 1070, 1070Ti and AMD 570 and 580 GPUs per unit. Our mining rigs are capable of efficiently mining approximately $400-$500 per month in Ethereum cryptocurrency and $500-600 per month in Bitcoin cryptocurrency per mining rig. It must be noted that the projected revenue estimates are directly linked to the highly volatile currency market conditions and daily Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) pricing.
 
Cryptocurrency mining is the underlying system that allows Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies, to be traded in a decentralized manner. It revolves around a ledger, or database, that is continuously updated and accessible to the public. Nodes have a copy of the ledger and verify the transactions by completing difficult mathematical problems by utilizing the GPU of the mining rigs. The validators are called “miners”. They authenticate and group transactions into cryptographically protected “blocks” which are then added to the public “chain”. Cryptocurrency miners are slowly rewarded with Bitcoin or Ethereum for carrying out this work, which involves substantial computing power.
 
In addition to our five current mining rigs we may, in the future, create additional mining rigs to increase our operations. The majority of mining companies purchase ASIC based mining rigs from China, which requires a long waiting period. In contrast, we believe all of our mining rigs will be created in-house with hardware from US based suppliers. It is the belief of the Company that building rigs from the ground up will allow us to scale our mining operations significantly faster than many competitors.
 
At present we will focus on mining Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have seen substantial and very public growth since their introduction. Our mining rigs are capable of mining alternative cryptocurrencies and we may evaluate, in the future, mining additional cryptocurrencies such as Zcash, Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Gold and Monero. Such plans have not been fully developed at this point in time. We store our mined Bitcoin and Ethereum in a high-security, state-of-the-art cold storage wallets using the advanced cold storage wallet system provided by Coinbase.
 
In order to market and increase awareness of our Company we have hired a third party graphic artist and website developer to create and build a new website for our Company. This website is currently under development, although we anticipate it will be fully completed within several months.
 
In the future, the Company intends to, through as of yet unidentified means, expand its operations into different sectors related to the blockchain including, but not strictly limited to, dynamic cryptocurrency mining applications, blockchain applications, solidity smart contract development, cryptocurrency hashpower leasing, sales, service and B2B cryptocurrency consultation.

At present all of our mining rigs are managed and operated solely by our officers and directors.
 
The Company’s executive offices are located in Huntington Beach, CA, at 5445 Oceanus Drive, Suite 102, Huntington Beach, CA, 92649.
