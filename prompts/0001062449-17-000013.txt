Buffalo Wild Wings is an established and growing owner, operator, and franchisor of restaurants featuring a variety of boldly-flavored, crave-able menu items, including our Buffalo, New York-style chicken wings. Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants create a welcoming neighborhood atmosphere that includes an extensive multi-media system, a full bar and an open layout, which appeals to sports fans and families alike. We differentiate our restaurants by the social environment we create and the connection we make with our Team Members, guests and the local community. Our guests have the option of watching sporting events or other popular programs on our projection screens and approximately 60 additional televisions, competing in Buzztime® Trivia or playing video games. The open layout of our restaurants offers dining and bar areas that provide distinct seating choices for sports fans and families. Our restaurants offer flexibility and allow our guests to customize their Buffalo Wild Wings experience to meet their time demands, service preferences or the experience they are seeking for a workday lunch, a dine-in dinner, a take-out meal, an afternoon or evening enjoying a sporting event or a late-night craving. Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants are the place people want to be, where any excuse to get together is a good one.

Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants have widespread appeal and have won dozens of “Best Wings” and “Best Sports Bar” awards across the country. Our made-to-order menu items are enhanced by the bold flavor profile of our 16 signature sauces and 5 signature seasonings, ranging from Sweet BBQ™ to Blazin’®. Our restaurants offer 20 to 40 domestic and imported beers on tap, including craft brews, and a wide selection of bottled beers, wines, and liquor. Our award-winning food and memorable experience drive guest visits and loyalty.

We have established the Buffalo Wild Wings brand through coordinated marketing and operational execution that ensures brand recognition and quality and consistency throughout our concept. These efforts include marketing programs and irreverent advertising to support both our company-owned and franchised restaurants. We also prominently feature our trademark Buffalo insignias, yellow and black colors, sports memorabilia, multiple televisions and projection screens, and exterior trade dress at our restaurants and on our company materials. Our concept is further strengthened by our emphasis on operational excellence supported by operating guidelines and employee training in both company-owned and franchised restaurants.

The Buffalo Wild Wings brand was founded in 1982 at a location near The Ohio State University. Our original name was Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck® and we became more popularly known as bw-3®. In 1991, we began our franchising program. In 2003, we completed an initial public offering and became a publicly-held company. Today, we operate throughout the United States and Canada and are widely recognized as Buffalo Wild Wings or B-Dubs®. Our franchisees also operate internationally.
We have a majority interest in Rusty Taco, Inc., the operator and franchisor of R Taco®, with both company-owned and franchised locations. R Taco is a distinctive fast-casual taco concept, inspired by fun and adventure. Our menu features a variety of tasty tacos at an affordable price, in a lively and welcoming environment. Each taco is hand-made fresh and fast in our open kitchen, using ingredients made from scratch. The result is authentic Mexican street-style tacos that are both traditional and inventive, each with a unique flavor and personality. Warm chips, house-made salsas, craft beers and no-frills margaritas round out the experience.

We have a minority interest in Pie Squared Holdings, operator and franchisor of PizzaRev®, a California-based fast-casual pizza restaurant. In addition to our minority investment, we also own and operate two PizzaRev restaurants in Minnesota. PizzaRev is a fast-casual pizza concept that empowers guests to craft their own custom personal pizza, using fresh ingredients and homemade pizza dough. Guests have the option of selecting their choice of crust, sauce and over 30 cheeses and fresh ingredients. 

Our Concept and Business Strategy

We aspire to be a growth enterprise of restaurant brands creating the ultimate guest experience worldwide. To escalate our strategy, we will:

•Continue to strengthen the Buffalo Wild Wings® brand domestically and internationally;
•Continuously develop and deliver unique guest experiences;
•Offer crave-able menu items with broad appeal;
•Create an inviting neighborhood atmosphere;
•Focus on operational excellence;
•Develop the R Taco® brand through unit growth and operational excellence;
•Open restaurants in new and existing domestic and international markets; and
•Increase same-store sales, average unit volumes, and profitability.
Buffalo Wild Wings Growth Strategy 

We have established and continue to expand the necessary infrastructure and control systems to support our disciplined growth strategy with our core concept, to be able to support approximately 1,700 restaurants in the United States and Canada.

In selected markets, we plan to continue to open new restaurants until a market is penetrated to a point that enables us to gain operational, cost, and other efficiencies. We intend to grow our franchise system through the development of new restaurants by existing and new franchisees. 
Along with planned unit growth, we are focused on innovating our Guest Experience for existing and new restaurants. This includes new technologies to make it easy for our guests to locate us, wait for a table, order from our menu and make their payments. We are also enhancing our Guest Experience by developing digital entertainment experiences inside and outside our restaurants to increase value and strengthen brand loyalty. In 2016, we began our roll-out of delivery to guests through third-party delivery providers. We also introduced our Blazin’ Rewards Loyalty Program where guests earn points through purchases and other activities. These points can be redeemed on food and non-alcoholic beverage items during future visits. We are also enhancing our take-out service and developing new restaurant formats. 
We will continue our international growth through development agreements with new and existing franchisees. As of December 25, 2016, we had restaurants open in Mexico, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Panama. We had seven signed franchise development agreements for restaurants in the Middle East, Mexico, Philippines, Panama, India and Vietnam. We intend to open 400 restaurants internationally in the next 10 to 12 years. A typical international franchise development agreement provides for payment of development fees and franchise fees in addition to subsequent royalty fees based on the gross sales of each restaurant. We expect development agreements for international locations to remain limited to organizations having significant experience as restaurant operators and proven financial ability to support and develop multi-unit and multi-brand operations. 

The Buffalo Wild Wings® Menu

Our Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants feature a variety of menu items including our Buffalo, New York-style chicken wings spun in one of our 16 signature sauces from sweet to screamin’ hot: Sweet BBQ, Teriyaki, Bourbon Honey Mustard, Mild, Parmesan Garlic, Medium, Honey BBQ, Spicy Garlic, Asian Zing®, Caribbean Jerk, Thai Curry™, Hot BBQ, Hot, Mango Habanero™, Wild® and Blazin’®; or 5 signature seasonings: Buffalo, Desert Heat®, Chipotle BBQ, Lemon Pepper and Salt & Vinegar. We have a take-out and party menu available to accomodate those who wish to take the Buffalo Wild Wings experience home or to an event. Our sauces and seasonings complement and distinguish our wings and other menu offerings to 
2

create a bold flavor profile for our guests. In addition to traditional and boneless chicken wings, our menu features a wide variety of food items including sharables, hamburgers, sandwiches, wraps, Buffalito® soft tacos, and salads. We also provide a 12 & Under Menu for kids.

Our restaurants feature a full bar which offers an extensive selection of 20 to 40 domestic, imported, and craft beers on tap as well as bottled beers, wine and liquor. In order to continually improve our menu, our research and development department continuously tests and introduces new menu items during our limited time "engagement zones". Our goal is to balance the established menu offerings that appeal to our loyal guests with new menu items that increase guest frequency and attract new guests. In addition, our food experience team created a “Sauce Lab” concept that features one to two brand new sauces that are introduced during our engagement zone promotions for a limited time only.

Buffalo Wild Wings Atmosphere and Layout

Our restaurants are sports grill and bars that provide a high-energy atmosphere where friends gather for camaraderie and to celebrate competition, as well as allow our guests the flexibility to customize their dining experience. The inviting and energetic environment of our restaurants is created using furnishings that can be easily rearranged to accommodate parties of various sizes. Our restaurants also feature distinct dining and bar areas, and many of the restaurants have patio seating.

We strategically place approximately 60 high-definition flat-screen monitors and 2 to 4 projection screens throughout the restaurant to allow for optimal viewing from every seat in the restaurant. A jumbotron is the central focal point of the layout with 2 or 3 screens driven by the latest in laser technology centered over the U-shaped bar which, in and of itself, is designed to create a social atmosphere. These televisions, combined with our sound system, Buzztime® Trivia, B-Dubs® TV and assorted video games, provide a source of entertainment for our guests and reinforce the energetic nature of our concept. We tailor the content and volume of our video and audio programming to reflect our guests’ tastes. We believe the design of our restaurants enhances our guests’ experiences, drives repeat visits and solidifies the broad appeal of our concept.

All of our menu items are made-to-order and are available for take-out in all locations or delivery in limited locations, which approximated 17% of restaurant sales for company-owned restaurants in 2016. Many of our restaurants have separate parking spots for our take-out guests.
Current Restaurant Locations

As of December 25, 2016, we owned and operated 631 company-owned restaurants, including 621 Buffalo Wild Wings®, 8 R Taco®, and 2 PizzaRev® restaurants in the United States and Canada. We also had an additional 609 franchised restaurants, including 602 Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants and 7 R Taco restaurants. In 2017, we expect to open approximately 15 company-owned Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants, and we expect our franchisees will open approximately 15 Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants in the United States and approximately 20 Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants internationally. We also expect to open approximately 2 company-owned R Taco restaurants and we expect our franchisees will open 12 to 15 R Taco restaurants. 

Our company-owned Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants range in size from 3,900 to 11,200 square feet, with a typical size of approximately 6,100 square feet for restaurants that were opened or acquired in the last three years. We anticipate that our 2017 restaurants will range in size from 4,000 square feet to 6,500 square feet with an average cash investment per restaurant of approximately $2.4 million, excluding preopening expenses of approximately $251,000. From time to time, we expect that our restaurants may be smaller or larger or cost more or less than our targeted range, depending on the particular circumstances of the selected site, market, or country. Also, from time to time, we expect to purchase the building for certain restaurants, in which case the cash investment would be significantly higher.

Our Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants are typically open on a daily basis from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m., although closing times vary depending on the day of the week and applicable regulations governing the sale of alcoholic beverages. Our franchise agreements require franchisees to operate their restaurants for a minimum of 12 hours a day.

Site Selection and Development

Our Buffalo Wild Wings® site selection process is integral to the successful execution of our growth strategy. We have processes for identifying, analyzing and assigning undeveloped markets for both company-owned and franchise development. Once a market is assigned, we use a trade area and site selection evaluation process to assist in identifying suitable trade areas within that market and suitable sites within identified trade areas. Criteria examined to determine appropriate trade areas include the presence of a casual dining corridor, projected growth within the trade area, the locations of key big box retailers, key demographics and population density, drive time and trade area analysis and other quantitative and qualitative measures. Once a suitable trade area is identified, we examine site-specific details including visibility, signage, access, ability to get trade dress, and parking. We employ an opportunistic approach to real estate by developing end caps, freestanding units, and conversions in urban, suburban, exurban and standalone smaller markets with strong trade areas. 
Marketing and Advertising

Buffalo Wild Wings® has created a unique brand experience with a loyal fan base, award-winning wings and sauces, a variety of beers and an exciting social atmosphere. This unique experience, centered around sports, sets us apart from our competition. Our marketing programs are designed to build awareness of our brand with sports fans, encouraging them to visit and ultimately develop a personal connection to Buffalo Wild Wings. These programs are developed to drive first-time guest sales, same-store sales and average check increase, and support strong restaurant openings.

Marketing Campaigns. Each marketing campaign has a theme that reflects guest lifestyles and behaviors. These lifestyles and behaviors are the cornerstone for creating key brand touch-points within each campaign that include media, promotions, partnerships, and food and beverage experiences that will encourage social interactions and bring each theme to life. For example, we promote Buffalo Wild Wings as having a mystical or magical ability to affect the outcome of sporting events. Through our loyalty program, we now have the ability to offer rewards to guests in restaurant when a game goes into overtime. In addition, our local restaurant marketing efforts are designed to enhance community connections. Examples of this are our Home Team Advantage and Eat Wings, Raise Funds programs that connect our restaurants to local sports teams and community groups. Our marketing also supports our system-wide partnership with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America through our Team up for Kids® program, through which we donate more than $2 million annually for their sports programs. 

Advertising. Our media strategy builds continuity throughout the year while still supporting our peak periods. Our primary media vehicles include national television in relevant programming to drive awareness and consideration, national and local radio to drive consideration and trial and digital and search to drive all three. 

Franchise Involvement. System-wide campaigns and promotions are developed and implemented with input from the Marketing Subcommittee, a subset of the Buffalo Wild Wings Franchise Advisory Council (FAC). The FAC is a volunteer group consisting of twelve franchisees, six of which are elected by their peers and six of which are jointly appointed by existing FAC members and us. The FAC’s Marketing Subcommittee comprises two franchisee members of the FAC and two to four additional franchisee members that are asked to serve on the committee at our request. The Marketing Subcommittee meets regularly to review marketing strategies, provide input on advertising messages and vendor co-op programs, and discuss marketing objectives.
Operations

Our leadership team strives for operational excellence by recruiting, developing and supporting our management teams and Team Members while implementing operational standards and best practices within our Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants.

Operations Management. Our restaurant management structure consists of a General Manager, an Operations General Manager, a Heart of House Manager, a Front of House Manager, and Assistant Managers and Shift Leads, depending on the sales volume of the restaurant. We utilize Regional Managers to oversee our General Managers in our company-owned locations, ensuring that they receive the training and support necessary to effectively operate their restaurants. Currently, we have approximately 100 Regional Managers who oversee 4 to 8 restaurants each. As we expand geographically, we expect to add additional Regional Managers. We have a Vice President of Company and Franchise Operations and three Divisional Vice Presidents who have responsibility for all company-owned operations and 14 Directors of Operations who provide leadership to the Regional Managers. We also have a Vice President of Franchise Operations who reports to our Vice President of Company and Franchise Operations. This individual has responsibility for all franchised restaurant operations and three Franchise Directors of Operations who provide leadership to 15 Franchise Consultants who oversee 24 to 45 restaurants each.

Guest Experience Business Model. Our Guest Experience Business Model is a comprehensive approach to restaurant operations, which includes Guest Experience Captains, a refined management structure with clearly defined roles, and the introduction of new guest technology including unique tabletop tablets and the development of a proprietary television network. Redefining the management and Team Member structure allows our restaurants to separate the work in a way that supports the business model. Team Members and Managers have more specific areas of responsibility, including essential operational work and Guest Experience work, such as guest engagement and community connection.

Kitchen Operations. An important aspect of our concept is the efficient design, layout and execution of our kitchen operations. Due to the relatively simple preparation of our menu items, the kitchen consists of fryers, grill, oven and food production stations that are arranged assembly-line style for maximum productivity. Given our menu and kitchen design, we do not require the added expense of an on-site chef. The ease and simplicity of our kitchen operations allows us to achieve our goal of preparing quality food with minimal wait times.

Training. We provide thorough training for our management and hourly Team Members to prepare them for their role in delivering a positive and engaging Buffalo Wild Wings® experience for our guests.

Our managers are trained using a hands-on education process during a six-week period at one of our Certified Training Restaurants. During this training period, our manager trainees participate in and learn about key aspects of the business – from our culture to our core focus areas: Team, Guest, Quality Operations and Sales and Profits. This includes experience in both hourly and management functions.

After successful completion of the manager training program, the new managers work with their General Managers to build a tailored program to meet their training and development needs, specific to their assigned area of responsibility. A library of targeted modules covering both technical and managerial skills serves as the vehicle for this phase of learning. The program, which is progressive in nature, is also built around our core focus areas. 

Later in their careers, our General Managers and high-potential Operations General Managers attend a management skills class where they take a deeper look into bringing all of the core elements for success together to create the ultimate experience for our guests.

Our hourly Team Members complete a comprehensive position certification process, which includes a minimum of 30 hours of hands-on training. Team Members must also successfully pass position validations, which include menu certifications, responsible alcohol service training, chemical safety training, and training for the safe handling of food as appropriate for their position.

Hourly restaurant Team Members who have demonstrated outstanding performance are provided opportunities for career advancement. Those with a high level of knowledge in one or more positions within the restaurant are encouraged to apply for the Wing Certified Trainer (WCT) program. The WCT candidate completes a training plan, which includes developing and evaluating his/her ability to train and influence the performance of Team Members. Our objective is to have two WCTs in every hourly position in each restaurant. Team Members who have performed successfully as Wing Certified Trainers in four or more station areas can apply to become All-Star Trainers. Our WCTs have the opportunity to travel around the country to assist with training at new restaurant openings. 

Further, hourly Team Members with management potential can participate in the Shift Lead program, which is a developmental program that provides hourly Team Members the opportunity to build and demonstrate leadership capabilities while providing the restaurants with leaders who are trained to support management. The Shift Lead program helps us to identify talent and build bench strength throughout the organization – through the selection and training of those who have demonstrated the initiative, desire, behaviors and competencies necessary for success in restaurant management or other positions of leadership.
Career Opportunities. Through our training programs, we are able to motivate and retain our field operations team by providing them with opportunities for increased responsibilities and advancement. In addition, we offer performance-based incentives tied to sales, profitability and qualitative measures such as guest and team-related metrics. We strive for a balance of internal promotion and external hiring. This provides us with the ability to retain and grow our Team Members and to infuse our organization with talented individuals from outside of Buffalo Wild Wings.

Recruiting. We actively recruit and select individuals who demonstrate enthusiasm and dedication and who share our passion for high quality guest service delivered through teamwork and commitment. To attract high caliber managers, we have 
5

developed a competitive compensation plan that includes a base salary and an attractive benefits package, including participation in a management incentive plan that rewards managers for achieving restaurant performance objectives. 
Food Preparation and Quality Control

We strive to maintain high quality standards. Our systems are designed to protect food and beverage products throughout the supply chain. We provide detailed specifications to suppliers for our food ingredients, products and supplies. 
Our operational teams have multiple processes in the restaurants to ensure that food safety and quality standards are met throughout the storing, preparation, cooking and service process. We have dedicated resources focused on maintaining food safety and quality specifications. In addition, we contract third party auditors to monitor food safety and sanitation standards. Our restaurant managers are certified in a comprehensive food safety and sanitation course, ServSafe®, which was developed by the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation.
Sourcing and Supply

We take a centralized approach to purchasing and supply chain management. Our supply chain team serves all Buffalo Wild Wings® company-owned and franchised locations in the U.S. and Canada. Additionally, the supply chain team works with international franchisees to ensure proprietary goods and services are available in all international locations. 
The supply chain team is responsible for all major food, paper, equipment, and supply purchases as well as company-owned restaurant utility contracts, marketing/print materials, and a percentage of restaurant services. We also have dedicated distribution and logistics Team Members dedicated to optimizing freight costs. 
We have national distribution programs in the U.S. and Canada that include food, beverage, and packaging goods. These national programs are with two custom distribution companies (one in the U.S. and one in Canada). We utilize a third distribution company in Hawaii. The companies provide only products approved for our system through a limited number of warehouses. The customized nature of our distribution network allows our supply chain team to more effectively control the volumes and costs associated with items required by our restaurants. 
To maximize purchasing efficiencies and obtain optimum pricing for ingredients, products, and supplies, our supply chain team negotiates prices by leveraging our scope and scale to create purchasing power and efficiencies. Our supply chain team works with suppliers to ensure that sufficient levels of inventory are available to ensure continuous supply to our restaurants. In addition, we are consistently evaluating our supply chain to develop contingency plans for all critical items.
Traditional chicken wings are an important component of cost of sales at our Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants. We work to counteract the effect of the volatility of chicken wing prices, which can affect our cost of sales and cash flow, with the introduction of new menu items, effective marketing promotions, focused efforts on food costs and waste, and menu price increases. We also identify and implement purchasing strategies in order to mitigate the impact of cost increases and market fluctuations. The price we pay on chicken wings changes monthly and is determined based on the average of the previous month’s wing market plus a mark-up for processing and distribution. If the monthly average exceeds an upper threshold or falls below a lower threshold set in the contract, we split the impact with our suppliers, reducing our risk related to wing price fluctuations. We continually evaluate alternative pricing models in order to mitigate price volatility.
Restaurant Franchise Operations

Our Buffalo Wild Wings® and B-Dubs®concepts have a strong group of franchisees, many of whom have substantial prior restaurant operations experience. An area development agreement establishes the number of restaurants that must be developed in a defined geographic area and the deadlines by which these restaurants must open. For area development agreements covering three to seven restaurants, restaurants are often required to open in approximately 12-month intervals. For larger development agreements, the interval is typically shorter. The area development agreement can be terminated by us if, among other reasons, the area developer fails to open restaurants on schedule. Our franchisees execute a separate franchise agreement for each restaurant opened, providing for a 10 to 20-year initial term, with an opportunity to enter into a renewal franchise agreement subject to certain conditions. The initial franchise fee for a single restaurant is generally $40,000.

U.S. franchisees typically pay us a royalty fee of 5.0% of their restaurant sales. We also assess franchisees an advertising fee in the amount of 3.5% of their restaurant sales. Since June 1, 2015, U.S. franchisees have been required to contribute 2.75% to 3.15% to our National Advertising Fund (NAF) and the remaining 0.35% to 0.75% was required to be spent directly by the 
6

franchisee or through marketing co-ops in the applicable local market. Our current form of franchise agreement permits us to increase the royalty fee and to increase the required contribution to the NAF by 0.5% per year so long as the NAF contribution does not exceed 4.0% of restaurant sales during the initial term of the franchise agreement. The royalty fee is not expected to increase in 2017.

All of our franchise agreements require that each franchised restaurant operate in accordance with our defined operating procedures, adhere to the menu established by us, meet applicable quality, service, health and cleanliness standards and comply with all applicable laws. We ensure these high standards are being followed through a variety of means including mystery shoppers and announced and unannounced quality assurance inspections by our franchise consultants. We may terminate the franchise rights of any franchisee who does not comply with our standards and requirements. We believe that maintaining superior food quality, an inviting and energetic atmosphere and excellent guest service are critical to the reputation and success of our concept; therefore, we consistently enforce the contractual requirements of our franchise agreements.

We work hard to maintain positive and productive relationships with our franchisees. We have formed and maintain the FAC, which, as described previously, is an advisory council made up of twelve franchisees that engage with BWW on matters of system-wide importance; six of these FAC members are elected by their peers, and the remaining six are appointed jointly by existing FAC members and us. The FAC meets several times per year in person, and more frequently via conference calls, with our senior leaders. We also have other councils of franchisees with whom we consult periodically on specific matters.

Information Technology

We utilize a standard point-of-sale system in all of our Buffalo Wild Wings® and R Taco® restaurants. Company-owned restaurants are integrated to our central offices through a secure, high-speed connection. Visibility to sales, cost of sales, labor and other operating metrics is provided to company-owned restaurant management through web-based decision support and analysis tools. Franchisees are required to report sales on a daily basis through an on-line reporting network and submit their restaurant-level financial statements on a quarterly and annual basis. Our international franchised restaurants also utilize this point-of-sale system, allowing their sales information to be automatically obtained by our central office systems on a daily basis. Our online ordering system allows guests to place orders online or through our mobile app. Orders taken online are sent directly to the point-of-sale system and routed to the kitchen management system based on item cook times and time of customer order pickup. The online ordering system is available for all company-owned and franchised locations.
Competition

The restaurant industry is intensely competitive. We compete on the basis of the taste, quality and price of food offered, guest service, ambience, location, and overall guest experience. We believe the atmosphere of our restaurants, our sports viewing experience, our focus on our guest and the quality and distinctive flavor of our food enable us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. We believe we compete primarily with local and regional sports bars and national casual dining and fast-casual establishments, and to a lesser extent with quick service restaurants, such as wing-based take-out concepts. Many of our direct and indirect competitors are well-established national, regional or local chains and some have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. We also compete with other restaurant and retail establishments for site locations and restaurant Team Members.
Proprietary Rights

We own the rights to the Buffalo Wild Wings®, B-Dubs® and R Taco® service marks and to certain other service marks and trademarks used in our system in the U.S., Canada, and other countries where we have restaurants or anticipate opening restaurants in the future. We also own certain rights to the PizzaRev® trademark. We protect our sauce recipes as trade secrets by, among other things, requiring a confidentiality agreement with our sauce supplier and executive officers. It is possible that competitors could develop recipes and procedures that duplicate or closely resemble our recipes and procedures. We believe that our trademarks, service marks and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to our brand-building efforts and the marketing of our restaurant concept. We vigorously protect our proprietary rights. We cannot predict, however, whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights or the use by others of restaurant features based upon, or otherwise similar to, our concept. It may be difficult for us to prevent others from copying elements of our concept and any litigation to enforce our rights will likely be costly and may not be successful. Although we believe that we have sufficient rights to all of our trademarks and service marks, we may face claims of infringement that could interfere with our ability to market our restaurants and promote our brand. Any such litigation may be costly and divert resources from our business. Moreover, if we are unable to successfully defend against such claims, we may be prevented from using our trademarks or service marks in the future and may be liable for damages.

Government Regulation

The restaurant industry is subject to numerous federal, state and local governmental regulations, including those relating to the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages, sanitation, public health, fire codes, zoning, and building requirements. Each restaurant requires appropriate licenses from regulatory authorities allowing it to sell liquor, beer and wine, and each restaurant requires food service licenses from local health authorities. Our licenses to sell alcoholic beverages must be renewed annually and may be suspended or revoked at any time for cause, including violation by us or our employees of any law or regulation pertaining to alcoholic beverage control, such as those regulating the minimum age of employees or patrons who may serve or be served alcoholic beverages, the serving of alcoholic beverages to visibly intoxicated patrons, advertising, wholesale purchasing and inventory control. In order to reduce this risk, restaurant employees are trained in standardized operating procedures designed to assure compliance with all applicable codes and regulations. We are also subject to governmental regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors, and, as we expand into international markets, we may be subject to various foreign regulations. We have implemented policies, procedures and training to ensure compliance with these regulations.
We and our franchisees are also subject to laws governing our relationship with employees. Our failure or the failure of our franchisees to comply with international, federal, state and local employment laws and regulations may subject us to losses and harm our brands. The laws and regulations govern such matters as wage and hour requirements; workers’ compensation insurance; unemployment and other taxes; working and safety conditions; and citizenship and immigration status. Significant additional government-imposed regulations under the Fair Labor Standards Act and similar laws related to increases in minimum wages, overtime pay, paid leaves of absence, scheduling, and mandated health benefits, may also impact the performance of company-owned and franchised operations. In addition, employee claims based on, among other things, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, wage and hour requirements and payments to employees who receive gratuities, may divert financial and management resources and adversely affect operations. The losses that may be incurred as a result of any violation of such governmental regulations by the company or our franchisees are difficult to quantify.

We are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local departments relating to the service of alcoholic beverages, health, sanitation, and fire and safety standards. Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. We may also be subject in certain states to “dramshop” statutes, which generally allow a person injured by an intoxicated person to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. In addition, we are subject to various state and federal laws relating to the offer and sale of franchises and the franchisor-franchisee relationship. In general, these laws and regulations impose specific disclosure and registration requirements prior to the sale and marketing of franchises and regulate certain aspects of the relationship between franchisor and franchisee.

Because of gaming operations in our Nevada Buffalo Wild Wings facilities, the ownership and operation of those facilities are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as various local regulations related to gaming. Our gaming operations are also subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Nevada Gaming Commission, the Nevada State Gaming Control Board and various county and city licensing agencies. These gaming laws, regulations, and supervisory procedures are based upon declarations of public policy that are concerned with, among other things:


• | the prevention of unsavory or unsuitable persons from having a direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity;


• | the establishment and maintenance of responsible accounting practices;


• | the maintenance of effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including the establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues;


• | providing reliable record keeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the gaming authorities;


• | the prevention of cheating and fraudulent practices; and


• | providing a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees.

Any change in such laws, regulations, and procedures could have an adverse effect on the gaming operations in our Nevada facilities. Additional information regarding regulation related to gaming in our Nevada facilities can be found in Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K.

Team Members

As of December 25, 2016, we employed approximately 44,000 Team Members. We had approximately 3,400 full-time and 40,000 part-time Team Members working in our company-owned restaurants and 600 Team Members based out of our home office or in field management positions. Our Team Members are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced an organized work stoppage or strike. We believe that our working conditions and compensation packages are competitive and consider our relations with our Team Members to be good.
