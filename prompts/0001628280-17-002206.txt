ITEM 1 | BUSINESS

The Company
MGP is a limited liability company that was formed in Delaware on October 23, 2015. MGP conducts its operations through the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership formed by MGM on January 6, 2016 and acquired by MGP on April 25, 2016 (the "IPO Date"). MGP is one of the leading publicly traded REITs engaged in the acquisition, ownership and leasing of large-scale destination entertainment and leisure resorts, whose tenants generally offer diverse amenities including casino gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment and retail offerings. In connection with its initial public offering, MGP, through the Operating Partnership, acquired from MGM the real estate assets of The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Monte Carlo, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit and Beau Rivage (collectively, the “IPO Properties”) pursuant to a Master Contribution Agreement (the “MCA”) in exchange for Operating Partnership units representing limited partner interests in the Operating Partnership and the assumption by the Operating Partnership of $4 billion of indebtedness from the contributing MGM subsidiaries (the "Formation Transactions"). In addition, on August 1, 2016, MGM completed its acquisition of Boyd Gaming Corporation’s (“Boyd Gaming”) interest in Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa (“Borgata”). Immediately following such transaction, we acquired Borgata’s real estate assets from MGM for consideration consisting of the assumption by the Landlord of $545 million of indebtedness from a subsidiary of MGM and the issuance of 27.4 million Operating Partnership units to a subsidiary of MGM (the “Borgata Transaction”) and leased back the real property to a subsidiary of MGM. As of December 31, 2016, our properties collectively comprised 27,233 hotel rooms, approximately 2.6 million square feet of convention space, over 100 retail outlets, over 200 food and beverage outlets and over 20 entertainment venues.
MGP is organized in an umbrella partnership REIT (commonly referred to as an “UPREIT”) structure in which MGP owns substantially all of its assets and conducts substantially all of its business through the Operating Partnership, which is owned by MGP and certain other subsidiaries of MGM and whose sole general partner is one of MGP’s subsidiaries. MGM holds a controlling interest in MGP through its ownership of MGP’s Class B share, but does not hold any of MGP’s Class A shares. The Class B share is a non-economic interest in MGP which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from the operations of MGP or upon liquidation or winding up of MGP but which represents a majority of the voting power of MGP’s shares. The Class B share structure was put in place to align MGM’s voting rights in MGP with its economic interest in the Operating Partnership. As further described below, MGM will no longer be entitled to any voting rights if MGM and its controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP and its subsidiaries) aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests in MGP and the Operating Partnership falls below 30%.
Business
We generate all of our revenue by leasing all of our properties from a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership (the “Landlord”) to a subsidiary of MGM (the “Tenant”) pursuant to a long-term triple-net master lease agreement (the “Master Lease”). Upon consummation of MGP’s initial public offering, the Tenant was obligated to pay us approximately $550.0 million of rent under the Master Lease for the first lease year, which was increased in connection with the Borgata Transaction to an annual rent payment of $650.0 million, prorated for the remainder of the first lease year after the Borgata Transaction. The Tenant’s performance and payments under the Master Lease are guaranteed by MGM. Certain of MGM’s operating and other subsidiaries also directly hold Operating Partnership units collectively comprising a majority economic interest in, and will participate in distributions made by, the Operating Partnership.
Our portfolio consists of ten premier destination resorts operated by MGM, including properties that we believe are among the world’s finest casino resorts, and The Park in Las Vegas. Our properties include six large-scale entertainment and gaming-related properties located on the Las Vegas Strip (the “Strip”): Mandalay Bay, The Mirage, Monte Carlo, New York-New York, Luxor and Excalibur, and The Park, a dining and entertainment complex located between New York-New York and Monte Carlo which opened in April 2016. Outside of Las Vegas, we also own four market-leading casino resort properties: MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan, Beau Rivage and Gold Strike Tunica, both of which are located in Mississippi, and Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey. In the future, we plan to explore opportunities to expand by acquiring similar properties as well as strategically targeting a broader universe of real estate assets within the entertainment, hospitality and leisure industries.
Overview of MGM 
The Tenant is a wholly owned subsidiary of MGM, and MGM guarantees the Tenant’s performance and payments under the Master Lease. MGM formed MGP in order to optimize MGM’s real estate holdings and establish a growth-oriented public real estate entity that will benefit from its relationship with MGM and is expected to generate reliable and growing quarterly cash distributions on a tax-efficient basis. MGM is a premier operator of a portfolio of well-known destination resort brands.

MGM has significant holdings in gaming, hospitality and entertainment with current ownership or operating interests in a high quality portfolio of casino resorts with approximately 50,000 hotel rooms, 25,000 slot machines and 1,800 table games on a combined basis as of December 31, 2016 including our properties, Bellagio, MGM Grand, MGM National Harbor, MGM Macau and MGM’s unconsolidated affiliates. MGM owns an approximately 56% interest in MGM China Holdings Limited, a publicly traded company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which owns the MGM Macau resort and casino and is developing MGM Cotai, which is anticipated to open during the second half of 2017. MGM completed MGM National Harbor in Maryland on December 8, 2016, and is currently in the process of developing MGM Springfield in Massachusetts, which is expected to be completed in late 2018.
Overview of the Master Lease 
The Master Lease has an initial lease term of ten years with the potential to extend the term for four additional five-year terms thereafter at the option of the Tenant. The Master Lease provides that any extension of its term must apply to all of the properties under the Master Lease at the time of the extension. The Master Lease has a triple-net structure, which requires the Tenant to pay substantially all costs associated with each property, including real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the base rent, ensuring that the cash flows associated with our Master Lease will remain relatively predictable for the duration of its term. Additionally, the Master Lease provides us with a right of first offer with respect to MGM National Harbor in Maryland and MGM’s development property located in Springfield, Massachusetts, which we may exercise should MGM elect to sell these properties in the future (collectively, the “ROFO Properties”).
On August 1, 2016, Borgata was added to the existing Master Lease between the Landlord and the Tenant. As a result, the initial annual rent amount under the Master Lease increased by $100.0 million to $650.0 million, prorated for the remainder of the first lease year after the Borgata Transaction. Rent under the Master Lease consists of a “base rent” component (the “Base Rent”) and a “percentage rent” component (the “Percentage Rent”). For the first year, the Base Rent represents 90% of the initial annual rent amount under the Master Lease, or an annual rate of $585.0 million following the Borgata Transaction, and the Percentage Rent represents 10% of the initial annual rent amount under the Master Lease, or an annual rate of $65.0 million following the Borgata Transaction. The Base Rent includes a fixed annual rent escalator of 2.0% for the second through the sixth lease years (as defined in the Master Lease). Thereafter, the annual escalator of 2.0% will be subject to the Tenant and, without duplication, the MGM operating subsidiary sublessees of our Tenant (such sublessees, collectively, the “Operating Subtenants”), collectively meeting an adjusted net revenue to rent ratio of 6.25:1.00 based on their adjusted net revenue from the leased properties subject to the Master Lease (excluding net revenue attributable to certain scheduled subleases and, at the Tenant’s option, certain reimbursed costs). The Percentage Rent is a fixed amount for approximately the first six lease years and will then be adjusted every five years based on the average annual adjusted net revenues of our Tenant and, without duplication, the Operating Subtenants from the leased properties subject to the Master Lease at such time for the trailing five-calendar-year period (calculated by multiplying the average annual adjusted net revenues, excluding net revenue attributable to certain scheduled subleases and, at the Tenant’s option, certain reimbursed costs for the trailing five-calendar-year period by 1.4%). The Master Lease includes covenants that impose ongoing reporting obligations on the Tenant relating to MGM’s financial statements which, in conjunction with MGM’s public disclosures to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") , gives us insight into MGM’s financial condition on an ongoing basis. The Master Lease also requires MGM, on a consolidated basis with the Tenant, to maintain an EBITDAR to rent ratio (as described in the Master Lease) of 1.10:1.00.
Overview of Management and Governance
We have a dedicated, experienced management team with extensive experience in the gaming, lodging and leisure industry, and who will receive incentive-based equity compensation linked to the performance of our company. This leadership team is bolstered by a board of directors that includes independent directors.
Our operating agreement provides that whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between MGM or any of its affiliates (other than the Company and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Company or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, any resolution or course of action by our board of directors in respect of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to the Company if it is (i) approved by a majority of a conflicts committee which consists solely of independent directors (which we refer to as “Special Approval”) (such independence determined in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange’s listing standards, the standards established by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to serve on an audit committee of a board of directors and certain additional independence requirements in our operating agreement), (ii) determined by our board of directors to be fair and reasonable to the Company or (iii) approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares (excluding voting shares owned by MGM and its affiliates); provided, however, that our operating agreement provides that any transaction, individually or in the aggregate, over $25 million between MGM or any of its affiliates (other than the Company and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Company or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be permitted only if (i) Special Approval is obtained or (ii) such transaction is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares (excluding voting shares owned by MGM and its affiliates).

Competition
We compete with other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, lenders, gaming companies and other investors. For further discussion of the potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business and Operations – Our pursuit of investments in, and acquisitions or development of, additional properties (including our acquisition of the ROFO Properties) may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations.”
Segment and Geographic Financial Information
The Company’s real estate properties are similar to one another in that they consist of large-scale destination entertainment and leisure resorts and related offerings, whose tenants generally offer casino gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment and retail, are held by a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, have similar economic characteristics and are governed under a single Master Lease. As such, our properties are reported as one reportable segment. 
The Company’s real estate properties are all located domestically in the United States with the majority being located in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
Please see the accompanying combined and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information about the Company's sole reportable segment, including net income and total assets.

Environmental Regulations and Potential Liabilities
Government Regulation Relating to the Environment.    Many laws and governmental regulations relating to the environment are applicable to our properties, and changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently and may adversely affect us.
Costs related to environmental compliance. As an owner of real property, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. Although we do not operate or manage our properties, we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and clean-up of any property from which there has been a release or threatened release of a regulated material as well as other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release. We are not aware of any environmental issues that are expected to have a material impact on the operations of any of our properties.
In addition to these costs, which are typically not limited by law or regulation and could exceed the property’s value, we could be liable for certain other costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons, property or natural resources. Further, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs the government incurs in connection with such contamination. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. 
Pursuant to the Master Lease, any liability arising from or relating to environmental liabilities arising from the businesses and operations located at MGM's real property holdings prior to our initial public offering is retained by the Tenant and the Tenant has indemnified us (and our subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees and agents and certain other related parties) against any losses arising from or relating to such environmental liabilities. There can be no assurance that the Tenant will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations, or that MGM will be able to fully satisfy its obligations pursuant to its guarantee. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in receiving from the Tenant or MGM any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses while seeking recovery from the Tenant or MGM.
Intellectual Property
In connection with the Formation Transactions, we entered into a royalty-free intellectual property rights license agreement (the "IP License Agreement") with MGM pursuant to which we will have the right to use "MGM" in the corporate names of our company and our subsidiaries without royalties for up to 50 years. Pursuant to the IP License Agreement, we will also have the right to use the "MGM" mark and the "MGM" logo in our advertising materials without royalties for up to 50 years. We are reliant on MGM to maintain and protect its intellectual property rights and we could be adversely impacted by infringement, invalidation, unauthorized use or litigation affecting the licensed intellectual property or brand names used in the operation of the properties.
Corporate Information
MGP is a limited liability company that was formed in Delaware on October 23, 2015. MGP intends to make an election on its U.S. federal income tax return for its taxable year ended December 31, 2016 to be taxed as a REIT. The Operating Partnership is a Delaware limited partnership that was formed on January 6, 2016.

Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In particular, statements pertaining to our capital resources and the amount and frequency of future distributions contain forward-looking statements. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “believes,” “expects,” “could,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “likely,” “intends,” “plans,” “pro forma,” “projects,” “estimates” or “anticipates” or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases that are predictions of or indicate future events or trends and that do not relate solely to historical matters. You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make regarding the timing and amount of any future dividends and our ability to acquire additional properties, including the ROFO Properties, in the future.
Forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties and you should not rely on them as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them. We do not guarantee that the transactions and events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all). The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements:
4


• | We are dependent on MGM (including its subsidiaries) unless and until we substantially diversify our portfolio, and an event that has a material adverse effect on MGM’s business, financial position or results of operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.


• | We depend on our properties for all of our anticipated cash flows.


• | We may not be able to re-lease our properties following the expiration or termination of the Master Lease.


• | Our sole material assets are Operating Partnership units representing 23.7% of the ownership interests in the Operating Partnership, over which we have operating control through our ownership of its general partner, and our ownership interest in the general partner of the Operating Partnership. Because our interest in the Operating Partnership represents our only cash-generating asset, our cash flows and distributions depend entirely on the performance of the Operating Partnership and its ability to distribute cash to us.


• | The Master Lease restricts our ability to sell our properties or our interests in the Operating Partnership and Landlord.


• | We will have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.


• | Covenants in our debt agreements may limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach or default could materially adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.


• | Rising expenses could reduce cash flow and funds available for future acquisitions and distributions.


• | We have a limited operating history and the Predecessor historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not be a reliable indicator of future results.


• | We are dependent on the gaming industry and may be susceptible to the risks associated with it, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.


• | Because a majority of our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the Strip, we are subject to greater risks than a company that is more geographically diversified.


• | Our pursuit of investments in, and acquisitions or development of, additional properties (including our acquisition of the ROFO Properties) may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations.


• | We may face extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities, and our operating agreement provides that any of our shares held by investors who are found to be unsuitable by state gaming regulatory authorities are subject to redemption.


• | Required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit future leases or transfers of our gaming properties, which could result in periods in which we are unable to receive rent for such properties.


• | Net leases may not result in fair market lease rates over time, which could negatively impact our income and reduce the amount of funds available to make distributions to shareholders.


• | Our dividend yield could be reduced if we were to sell any of our properties in the future.


• | There can be no assurance that we will be able to make distributions to our Operating Partnership unitholders and Class A shareholders or maintain our anticipated level of distributions over time.


• | An increase in market interest rates could increase our interest costs on existing and future debt and could adversely affect the price of our Class A shares.


• | MGP is controlled by MGM, whose interests in our business may conflict with ours or yours.


• | We are dependent on MGM for the provision of administration services to our operations and assets.


• | MGM’s historical results may not be a reliable indicator of its future results.


• | Our operating agreement contains provisions that reduce or eliminate duties (including fiduciary duties) of our directors, officers and others.


• | If MGM engages in the same type of business we conduct, our ability to successfully operate and expand our business may be hampered.


• | The Master Lease and other agreements governing our relationship with MGM were not negotiated on an arm’s-length basis and the terms of those agreements may be less favorable to us than they might otherwise have been in an arm’s-length transaction.


• | In the event of a bankruptcy of the Tenant, a bankruptcy court may determine that the Master Lease is not a single lease but rather multiple severable leases, each of which can be assumed or rejected independently, in which case underperforming leases related to properties we own that are subject to the Master Lease could be rejected by the Tenant while tenant-favorable leases are allowed to remain in place.


• | MGM may undergo a change of control without the consent of us or of our shareholders.


• | If MGP does not qualify to be taxed as a REIT, or fails to remain qualified to be taxed as a REIT, it will be subject to U.S. federal income tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

While forward-looking statements reflect our good-faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future performance. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors of new information, data or methods, future events or other changes. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future results, performance or transactions, see the section entitled “Risk Factors.”
Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Annual Report on Form 10-K speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of 
5

them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law. If we update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be made that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.
You should also be aware that while we from time to time communicate with securities analysts, we do not disclose to them any material non-public information, internal forecasts or other confidential business information. Therefore, you should not assume that we agree with any statement or report issued by any analyst, irrespective of the content of the statement or report. To the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain projections, forecasts or opinions, those reports are not our responsibility and are not endorsed by us.
