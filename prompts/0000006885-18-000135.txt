ITEM 1.                                        BUSINESS
Our Business
Stage Stores, Inc. and its subsidiary (“we,” “us” or “our”) is a retailer, which operates specialty department stores and off-price stores. We offer our customers, referred to as “guests,” trend-right, moderately priced, name-brand apparel, accessories, cosmetics, footwear and home goods. As of February 3, 2018, we operated in 42 states through 777 department stores under the BEALLS, GOODY’S, PALAIS ROYAL, PEEBLES and STAGE nameplates and 58 GORDMANS off-price stores. We also operate an e-commerce website for our department store business. Our department stores are predominantly located in small towns and rural communities. Our off-price stores are predominantly located in mid-sized, non-rural Midwest markets.
Our History
Stage Stores, Inc. was formed in 1988 when the management of Palais Royal, together with several venture capital firms, acquired the family-owned Bealls and Palais Royal chains, both of which were originally founded in the 1920s. At the time of the acquisition, Palais Royal operated primarily larger stores, located in and around the Houston metropolitan area, while Bealls operated primarily smaller stores, principally located in rural Texas towns. 
In 2003, we acquired Peebles Inc. (“Peebles”), a privately held, similarly small-market focused retail company headquartered in South Hill, Virginia. Our Peebles stores are located in the Mid Atlantic, Northeastern, Midwestern and Southeastern states. 
In July 2009, we acquired the “Goody’s” name from Goody’s Family Clothing, Inc. through a bankruptcy auction. Our Goody’s stores are primarily located in the Southeastern and Midwestern states. 
On April 7, 2017, we acquired select assets of Gordmans Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries through a bankruptcy auction (“Gordmans Acquisition”). The results of the Gordmans stores that we operated from April 7, 2017 through February 3, 2018 are included in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal year 2017 (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements). Our Gordmans stores are primarily located in the Midwestern states. 
Competition 
The department store and off-price retail markets are highly competitive and fragmented.  We operate in a challenging macroeconomic and retail environment and have numerous competitors as further described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K. We believe the principal differentiating factors which allow us to compete for guests’ patronage include great values on name brand merchandise, assortments that appeal to our target guests, exceptional service in convenient locations, compelling advertising and promotions and an omni-channel shopping experience.  We expect the strategic investments we have made and plan to continue to make will enable us to meet these guest expectations and leave us well positioned to compete in the future.

Stores
Store Openings and Closures. We added 58 Gordmans off-price stores in 2017 with the Gordmans Acquisition. We plan to open one new Gordmans store in early 2018. As part of a strategic evaluation of our department store portfolio in 2015, we announced a multi-year plan to close stores that we believe do not have the potential to meet our sales productivity and profitability standards. Since then, we have closed 81 stores, including 21 stores during 2017, and we expect to close approximately 30 stores in 2018. We continually review the profitability of each store and will consider closing a store if the expected store performance does not meet our financial standards. The closure of these stores is expected to improve our ability to effectively allocate capital, deliver higher sales productivity and be accretive to earnings.
Expansion, Relocation and Remodeling. During 2017, we completed 9 store remodels, relocations and expansions. Since 2015, we have updated over 200 stores representing approximately 45% of our sales base. We believe that our investment in these stores improves the store environment and helps us create an inviting and differentiated shopping experience. Our store remodels are designed to create a bright, fun and comfortable environment and include upgrades ranging from improved lighting, flooring, paint, fixtures, fitting rooms, visual merchandising and signage, to more extensive expansion projects. 
Store count and selling square footage by nameplate are as follows:

 | Number of Stores | Selling Square Footage (in thousands)
 | January 28, 2017 | 2017 Activity Net Changes | | February 3, 2018 | January 28, 2017 | 2017 Activity Net Changes | | February 3, 2018
Bealls | 188 | | (7 | ) | 181 | | 3,787 | | (171 | ) | 3,616 
Goody's | 223 | | (6 | ) | 217 | | 3,451 | | (88 | ) | 3,363 
Palais Royal | 49 | | (3 | ) | 46 | | 1,063 | | (73 | ) | 990 
Peebles | 187 | | (2 | ) | 185 | | 3,429 | | (39 | ) | 3,390 
Stage | 151 | | (3 | ) | 148 | | 2,858 | | (80 | ) | 2,778 
Gordmans | — | | 58 | | 58 | | — | | 2,825 | | 2,825 
Total | 798 | | 37 | | 835 | | 14,588 | | 2,374 | | 16,962

Our department stores are predominantly located in small towns and rural communities. Utilizing a ten-mile radius from each store, approximately 61% of our department stores are located in communities with populations below 50,000 people, while an additional 24% of our department stores are located in communities with populations between 50,000 and 150,000 people. The remaining 15% of our department stores are located in higher-density markets with populations greater than 150,000 people, such as Houston, San Antonio and Lubbock, Texas. 
Our Gordmans off-price stores are predominantly located in mid-sized, non-rural Midwest markets. 
Omni-channel
In our ongoing effort to enhance the guest experience, we are focused on better connecting our department store and online channels. Below are few examples of how our department store and online channels intersect:

• | Our website gives guests the opportunity to preview merchandise online before making a purchase in our stores.


• | Stores increase online sales by providing guests with the opportunity to view, touch and/or try on physical merchandise before ordering online.


• | Most online purchases can easily be returned in our stores.


• | In 2016, we introduced Buy Online, Ship-to-Store, which gives our guests the option to have online purchases shipped for free to a local store.


• | In 2017, we introduced Web@POS, which gives our guests access to our expanded online assortments from within our stores.


• | Style Circle Rewards® can be redeemed online or in stores regardless of where they are earned.


• | Guests may apply most discounts to both online and in-store purchases.

Providing our guests with the opportunity to engage with us through multiple channels is part of a cohesive business strategy that helps us build our brand loyalty. Guests that shop with us both online and in stores spend, on average, 3 times more than guests that shop only in our stores.

Merchandising
We offer a well-edited selection of moderately priced, branded merchandise within distinct merchandise categories of women’s, men’s and children’s apparel, accessories, cosmetics, footwear and home goods that reflect current styles and trends through our department stores, off-price stores and e-commerce website. 
The following table sets forth the distribution of net sales among our various merchandise categories:

 | Fiscal Year 
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 
Merchandise Category | Department Stores | | Off-price Stores | | Total Company | | 
Women’s | 35 | % | | 29 | % | 34 | % | 37 | % | 38 | %
Men’s | 17 | | | 13 | | 17 | | 17 | | 17 | 
Children's | 11 | | | 12 | | 11 | | 12 | | 11 | 
Apparel | 63 | % | | 54 | % | 62 | % | 66 | % | 66 | %
Footwear | 14 | % | | 2 | % | 12 | % | 13 | % | 13 | %
Accessories | 7 | | | 9 | | 8 | | 7 | | 7 | 
Cosmetics/Fragrances | 11 | | | 5 | | 10 | | 10 | | 10 | 
Home/Gifts/Other | 5 | | | 30 | | 8 | | 4 | | 4 | 
Non-apparel | 37 | % | | 46 | % | 38 | % | 34 | % | 34 | %
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | % | 100 | % | 100 | %

Our merchandise mix in our department stores offers more apparel categories, while our off-price stores carry a larger selection of home goods. Merchandise mix may also vary from store to store to accommodate differing demographic, regional and climate characteristics. Our buying and planning team uses technology tools such as size pack optimization, which allow us to better fulfill guest needs by tailoring size assortments by store. 
Approximately 82% of sales in our department stores consist of national brands such as Adidas, Calvin Klein, Carters, Chaps, Clinique, Dockers, Estee Lauder, G by Guess, Izod, Jessica Simpson, Levi’s, Nike, Nine West and Skechers, while the remaining 18% of sales are private label merchandise. Our off-price stores offer national brands purchased opportunistically bringing greater value to our guests.
Our department store private label portfolio brands are developed and sourced through agreements with third party vendors. We believe our private label and exclusive brands offer a compelling mix of style, quality and value. 
Merchandise Distribution
 We distribute merchandise to our department stores through our distribution centers located in Jacksonville, Texas, and Jeffersonville, Ohio and to our Gordmans off-price stores through our distribution center in Omaha, Nebraska. In December 2017, we closed our South Hill, Virginia, distribution center, as part of our strategy to increase the efficiency of our distribution network. Operations from the Virginia distribution center have been transferred to our distribution centers in Texas and Ohio. E-commerce orders are predominantly filled from our distribution center in Jacksonville, Texas and to a lesser extent, from our distribution center in Jeffersonville, Ohio, select stores and directly from our vendors. We contract with third party carriers to deliver merchandise to our stores and to our guests in the fulfillment of online orders. Guests also have the option to pick up an online order in a local store through our Buy Online, Ship-to-Store program.

Marketing 
Our marketing strategy is designed to establish and reward brand loyalty. The strategy supports each store’s position as the destination for desirable styles and national brands at an attractive value in a comfortable and welcoming environment. Our marketing strategy leverages (i) insights from brand and guest research, (ii) identified guest purchase history and (iii) emerging technology and trends in retail marketing. We use a multi-media advertising approach, including broadcast media, digital media, mobile media, direct mail, and to a lesser degree, newspaper inserts. 
Our department stores and off-price stores are similar in many respects. However, our department stores offer deeper, more curated assortments with sales driven by high-low promotions. Conversely, our Gordmans off-price stores offer every day value in a “treasure hunt” environment with sales driven by holidays, back-to-school, and other calendar events. 
We consider our private label credit card program, and our loyalty programs, Style Circle Rewards® and gRewardsTM, to be vital components of our business because these programs (i) enhance guest loyalty, (ii) allow us to identify and regularly contact our best guests and (iii) create a comprehensive database that enables us to implement targeted and personalized marketing messages. On average, private label credit cardholders and loyalty members visit our stores more frequently, spend more annually, and are less likely to attrite than non-loyalty guests. In our department stores, private label credit card purchases represented 49%, 47% and 44% of our sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In our Gordmans off-price stores, we acquired a historically underpenetrated private label credit card program and implemented best practices developed in our department stores, which we expect to drive future growth. In 2017, we relaunched the value proposition for Style Circle Rewards® and our private label credit card in conjunction with launching gRewardsTM. We ended 2017 with 7.4 million Style Circle Rewards® members and 0.8 million gRewardsTM members. These programs allow us to better understand and respond to our guests’ shopping habits and are powerful tools to drive higher transaction value and frequency of visits.
Brand image is an important part of our marketing program. Our principal trademarks, including the BEALLS, GOODY’S, PALAIS ROYAL, PEEBLES, STAGE and GORDMANS, have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We have also registered trademarks used in connection with our private label merchandise. We regard our trademarks and their protection as important to our success.

We maintain a connection to the communities we serve and operate a giving campaign in the markets we serve called 30 Days of Giving under our Community Counts program. In 2017, through our Community Counts program and other efforts like our Bears that Care program and Hurricane Harvey relief efforts, we helped raise approximately $3.0 million for our communities.
Guest Service

We strive to provide exceptional guest service. To ensure consistency of execution, each sales associate is evaluated based on the attainment of specific guest service standards, such as offering a friendly greeting, providing prompt assistance, helping open private label credit card accounts, thanking guests and inviting return visits. We also conduct guest satisfaction surveys to measure and monitor attainment of service expectations. The results of guest surveys are used to provide feedback to reinforce and improve store service. Additionally, we have various programs in place to recognize our sales associates for providing outstanding guest service.

Information Systems
We support our business by using multiple, highly integrated systems in areas such as merchandising, store operations, distribution, sales promotion, asset protection, personnel management, store design and accounting. Our core merchandising systems assist in planning, ordering, allocating and replenishing merchandise assortments for each store, based on specific characteristics and recent sales trends. Our replenishment/fulfillment system allows us to maintain planned levels of in-stock positions in basic items such as jeans and undergarments. In addition, a fully integrated warehouse management system is in place in all three distribution centers.
Our assortment planning system allows us to create guest-centric assortments aligned to sales strategies. The system also facilitates cleaner seasonal transitions and fresher merchandise in stores. We continue to expand the utilization and effectiveness of our merchandise planning system to maximize the generation of sales and gross margin. 
We utilize a point-of-sale (“POS”) platform with bar code scanning, electronic credit authorization, instant credit, a returns database and gift card processing in all our stores. The POS platform allows us to capture guest specific sales data for use in our merchandising, marketing and loss prevention systems, while servicing our guests. The POS platform also manages coupon and deal-based pricing, which streamlines the checkout process and improves store associate adherence to promotional markdown policies. 
In 2017, we implemented new systems to facilitate our Web@POS and Buy Online, Ship-to-Store programs as part of our strategy to better connect our department store and online channels. Web@POS provides guests access to our online merchandise assortments from within our department stores. Buy Online, Ship-to-Store provides our guests the ability to buy certain merchandise on our website and have it shipped to a store for pick-up. We also continue to invest in enhancements to improve the performance of our e-commerce website.
Our Employees
At February 3, 2018, we employed approximately 14,500 full-time and part-time employees, referred to as “associates.” Employment levels vary during the year as we traditionally hire additional sales associates and increase the hours of part-time sales associates during peak seasonal selling periods. We offer a broad range of company-paid benefits to our associates. Eligibility for and the level of benefits vary depending on associates' full-time or part-time status, compensation level, date of hire and/or length of service. Company-paid benefits include a 401(k) plan, deferred compensation plans, medical and dental plans, disability insurance, paid vacation, life insurance and merchandise discounts. We consider our relationship with our associates to be good, and there are no collective bargaining agreements in effect with respect to any of our associates. 
Seasonality
Our business, like many other retailers, is subject to seasonal influences with a significant portion of sales and income typically realized during the last quarter of our fiscal year. Working capital requirements fluctuate during the year and generally reach their highest levels during the third and fourth quarters. Because of the seasonality of our business, results from any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.
