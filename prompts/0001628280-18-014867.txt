Item 1. Business
Company Overview

We are a global materials distributor for chemicals products in North America and Asia and for plastics products in North America, EMEA and Asia. In connection with the distribution of chemicals products, we provide value-added services such as custom blending, packaging and re-packaging, private-label manufacturing and product testing in the form of chemical analysis, product performance analysis and product development. We also provide on-site and off-site hazardous and non-hazardous environmental services, including waste collection, transportation, recovery, disposal arrangement and recycling services in North America, primarily the U.S.  During fiscal year 2018, we distributed nearly 24,000 products in more than 80 countries for approximately 1,400 suppliers to approximately 27,300 customers. 
We have long-standing relationships with major chemicals and plastics producers and suppliers, a strong geographic presence and supply chain network and a balanced customer base that benefits from the service and distribution value we provide. The products we distribute are used in various end markets and customer segments within a broad cross section of manufacturing industries, including household, industrial and institutional, lubricants, performance coatings (including architectural coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers), automotive, healthcare, personal care, oil and gas and construction end markets.

The depth and diversity of our product line and service offerings allows us to provide many of our customers with a one-stop-shop resource for their chemicals and plastics needs. For customers with multiple locations, our centralized business model helps ensure consistency of product offerings and a single point of contact. Our services and broad product offerings allow for product customization, cost savings to customers on transaction and transportation costs and reliance on a single supplier to source all of a customer's diverse product requirements.

We believe we provide a compelling value proposition to suppliers as a single bulk buyer of their products and acting as an extension of their sales force by representing their brands and providing technical support to customers. Our deep understanding of key end markets presents suppliers with additional market reach and penetration opportunities, while our operating platform supports supplier visibility into the marketing and distribution of their products. We also believe we provide value to suppliers by distributing to larger customers through dedicated strategic accounts sales and marketing programs designed to solidify key relationships through enhanced customer service, efficient delivery and specialized value-added solutions. In addition to the value-added services mentioned above, we also provide dedicated stocking programs, vendor-managed inventory, quarterly customer demand forecasting, technical support and supply chain services.

We have an experienced management team with deep knowledge of the industry. We continue to implement strategies and invest to build upon our strengths by creating industry-leading marketing capabilities, including our focus on specific end markets, sales force effectiveness tools, market-based pricing and geographic expansion.
We distribute our product portfolio through a global supply chain consisting of approximately 170 owned, leased or third party warehouses, rail terminals and tank terminals with a private fleet of 1,110 units, including tractors and trailers, primarily in North America. We currently employ approximately 2,760 employees globally. At September 30, 2018, we had approximately 510 sales professionals in North America, EMEA and Asia, including technical support, field managers and strategic account managers who assist our customers in the selection and application of commodity and specialty products for their end products and processes.

Company History

We were formed as a Delaware corporation on March 24, 2014, under the name WL Ross Holding Corp., as a special purpose acquisition company for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We completed our IPO in June 2014, raising approximately $500.0 million in cash proceeds. We neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue prior to the Business Combination.
We acquired the business of Nexeo Solutions Holdings, LLC on June 9, 2016 through the Business Combination. In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, we changed our name from "WL Ross Holding Corp." to "Nexeo Solutions, Inc." and changed our ticker symbol for our common stock on NASDAQ from "WLRH" to "NXEO". 
On September 17, 2018, Nexeo and Univar entered into the Univar Merger Agreement providing for the acquisition of Nexeo by Univar. The Univar Merger Agreement and the proposed transaction were approved unanimously by the Board of Directors of both Nexeo and Univar and are subject to review by the SEC and regulatory agencies in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. The Univar Merger Agreement is also subject to a number of conditions, including, among other things and as further described in the Univar Merger Agreement: (i) the adoption by Nexeo’s stockholders of the Univar Merger Agreement, (ii) the approval by Univar’s stockholders of the issuance of the shares of Univar common stock in connection with the proposed transaction contemplated by the Univar Merger Agreement, (iii) the receipt of other required regulatory approvals, (iv) the absence of any law or governmental order prohibiting the proposed transaction, (v) the effectiveness of Univar's registration statement and the approval for listing on the NYSE of the shares of Univar common stock in connection with the proposed transaction contemplated by the Univar Merger Agreement, (vi) no material adverse effect on Nexeo's and Univar's operations having occurred since the signing of the Univar Merger Agreement and (vii) the termination of the TRA. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction will be satisfied or waived or that the proposed transaction will be completed. On November 16, 2018, Univar and Nexeo announced that the waiting period under the HSR Act expired.
See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Univar Merger Agreement.
Industry Overview
The global market for industrial materials encompasses the products we offer. This market contains both products distributed directly to customers by suppliers and indirectly by distribution channel partners. Indirect distribution channel partners, like us, serve as intermediaries between suppliers and customers representing an additional step in the distribution supply chain. Suppliers leverage their distribution partners to administer the complexity of servicing the small and mid-size customer base while providing needed technical product expertise. The total available market of distribution is driven by macroeconomic factors, as well as suppliers’ decisions to either serve markets or customers directly or use a distribution partner. By creating and executing superior distribution services and related capabilities, we strive to encourage suppliers to increase the magnitude of business being served by us as a distribution partner in the global market.

The chemicals and plastics materials distribution industry is characterized by increasingly complex regulatory, environmental and safety landscapes, the need for market intelligence that requires time and effort to develop and, in some cases, significant capital investments for transportation and storage infrastructure. Adding to the complexity of this business environment is the increasing demand by end customers for individualized solutions. These solutions are generally comprised of essential products and value-added services including blending, packaging and other special handling and special logistics requirements such as 24/7 delivery. We believe our ability to serve these complex needs as a result of our capabilities and scale will encourage suppliers to further leverage distributors like us as their preferred channel to market.

Company Operations
Business Strategy

We strive to become a brand extension partner for key suppliers, provide best-in-class service, and align our sales force expertise with our customers' needs. Our value proposition focuses on supplier needs and direct customer activities. We have established four main strategies that drive our formula for success. 
Go-To-Market Strategy. We aspire to use our technical capabilities, expertise and experience to commercially align with supplier strategies to operate as a brand extension while leveraging tools and systems to drive long-term loyalty through trust and transparency. Our sales force drives our customer-focused growth by utilizing technical expertise. The customer's journey is enhanced with a customized interface tailored for each customer's individual needs. 
Profitability Growth & Margin Expansion. We seek to form strategic partnerships by leveraging foundational capabilities to demonstrate value propositions. We plan to optimize our portfolio by eliminating low profit business, expanding specialty product mix and executing ongoing productivity initiatives. To supplement growth, we have been actively pursuing accretive bolt-on acquisitions of product lines and businesses complementary to our current offerings.

We are committed to continued operational excellence by broadening our value-added service capabilities and delivering best-in-class service through a culture of continuous improvement. We focus on pricing strategies to optimize profit and efficient cash utilization through fully integrated purchasing and global enterprise cash management. Our commitment to high quality service is demonstrated by dedicated customer service representatives, company-owned warehouses, a private fleet having an on-time delivery percentage of 98.8% and sophisticated inventory management practices.
Driving Scale & Fostering Innovation.  We benefit from data-driven decision making and focus on scalable, long-term growth drivers. We continuously drive synergies by leveraging our centralized platform. 
Competitive Strengths
We operate in a competitive industry and strive to differentiate ourselves from our competition by providing true end-to-end solutions, which requires using the right combination of integrated services that have the capacity and sophistication to serve larger customers while maintaining enough versatility to serve smaller customers. We believe our strengths include the following:

• | Centralized, scalable technology platform that allows us to efficiently manage the inherent complexity of our business and supports value creation by unlocking scale and scope efficiencies from both organic growth and strategic acquisitions;


• | Exceptional distribution network with strategically located facilities optimizing route density; and


• | Extensive product knowledge and end market expertise allowing us to act as an extension of our suppliers while providing application-based, value-added services to our customers.

Segment Overview

We operate through three lines of business, or operating segments: Chemicals, Plastics and Environmental Services. Our lines of business market to different sets of customers operating in an array of different industries, with various end markets and customer segments within those industries. For segment presentation and disclosure purposes, our Chemicals and Plastics lines of business constitute separate reportable segments, while our Environmental Services line of business, which does not meet the materiality threshold for separate disclosure, is included in an "Other" segment.


Chemicals. Our Chemicals line of business distributes specialty and industrial chemicals, additives and solvents to industrial users via railcars, barges and bulk tanker trucks and as packaged goods in trucks. Our chemicals products are distributed in approximately 50 countries worldwide, primarily in North America and Asia. In connection with the distribution of chemicals products, we provide value-added services such as custom blending, packaging and re-packaging, private-label manufacturing and product testing in the form of chemical analysis, product performance analysis and product development. While our Chemicals line of business serves multiple end markets, the key end markets within the industrial space are household, industrial and institutional, performance coatings (including architectural coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers), lubricants, oil and gas and personal care.

Plastics. Our Plastics line of business distributes a broad product line consisting of commodity polymer products and prime engineering resins to plastics processors engaged in blow molding, extrusion, injection molding and rotation molding via railcars, bulk trucks, truckload boxes and mixed truckloads, or less-than-truckload quantities. We distribute plastics products in more than 60 countries worldwide, primarily in North America, EMEA and Asia. Our Plastics line of business serves a broad cross section of industrial segments, including key automotive and healthcare end markets.
Other. Our Environmental Services line of business, in connection with certain waste disposal service companies, provides customers with comprehensive on-site and off-site hazardous and non-hazardous waste collection, transportation, recovery, disposal arrangement and recycling services in North America, primarily in the U.S. These environmental services are offered through our network of distribution facilities used as transfer facilities and through a staff of dedicated on-site waste professionals. Our Environmental Services line of business serves multiple end markets such as aerospace and defense, automotive, chemical manufacturing, industrial manufacturing and oil and gas.

The table below provides a summary by line of business of the approximate number of customers served and key product offerings as of September 30, 2018:


 | Chemicals | Plastics | Environmental Services 
 | Approximate Customers: 14,000(1) | Approximate Customers: 11,100(1) | Approximate Customers: 2,200(1) 
Key Products |  Alcohols Blends Esters Glycols Hydrocarbons Ketones Methanol Polyurethanes Resins Silicones Surfactants |  Engineered Thermoplastics Polyolefins (including Polypropylene) Styrenics |  On-Site Services Non-Hazardous and Hazardous Waste Disposal Non-Hazardous Waste Treatment/Recycling
(1) Customer duplication between lines of business is immaterial | | 

In each of the past three fiscal years, polypropylene was the only product that accounted for over 10.0% of our consolidated net revenue. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016 polypropylene accounted for 15.9%, 15.5%, and 17.6%, respectively, of total consolidated net revenue. For the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016, polypropylene accounted for 17.7% of the Predecessor total consolidated net revenue.


The charts below provide a summary of the proportional revenue contributions from our lines of business and primary geographic markets during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, based on the jurisdiction of the subsidiary entity receiving revenue credit for the sale. It was not practical to provide a summary of the revenue contributions of our primary geographic markets based on external customer location. The substantial majority of our sales to customers in the geographic markets described below are made by entities located within the applicable geographic market.

Our lines of business generally leverage the same infrastructure, distribution networks, information technology and operational processes, but are differentiated by the products they distribute, their geographic footprints and their distinct customer and supplier relationships. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional financial information with respect to our reportable segments.

Supplier Relationships

We source chemicals and plastics from a wide array of suppliers, including many leading global chemicals and plastics producers. We generally purchase and take possession of these products and then resell and deliver them to our customers. While our top ten suppliers generally fulfill approximately 55% of total product procured by value on an annual basis, we source products from approximately 1,400 suppliers. Two suppliers accounted for 11.6% and 9.6%, respectively, of consolidated purchases during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, 12.1% and 9.9%, respectively, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 and 11.9% and 10.4%, respectively, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Two suppliers accounted for 12.0% and 9.8%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 for the Predecessor consolidated purchases. 
We maintain multiple sourcing options for most key products that we distribute to help ensure supply continuity and competitive pricing for our customers. We believe the depth of our supplier base ensures that we are able to satisfy the needs of all of our customers in all of our key geographic regions.

Our Chemicals and Plastics lines of business generally source products from distinct sets of suppliers.


• | Chemicals. We source chemicals from many suppliers, including several of the largest global chemical companies such as DowDuPont, Eastman Chemical, LyondellBasell, Methanex and Solvay. Our ten largest suppliers generally account for approximately 55% by value of the chemical products procured on an annual basis. 


• | Plastics. Our plastics suppliers include several of the largest global chemical companies and plastics producers, such as BASF, Borealis, ExxonMobil Chemical Co., LyondellBasell and SABIC. Our ten largest suppliers generally account for approximately 85% by value of the plastics products procured on an annual basis. 

In developing our supplier relationships, we evaluate prospective suppliers to determine the value they offer to the supply chain. We focus on suppliers that manufacture products utilized within the end markets we serve and provide opportunities that maintain healthy demand. Our key suppliers must also demonstrate a proven track record of reliability and commitment to invest in their businesses, as well as product price leadership.
We believe we provide value to suppliers in numerous ways, including the following:


• | We serve as an aggregator of customer demand, enabling us to act as a single bulk buyer of our suppliers’ products;


• | We act as an extension of suppliers’ sales force by representing their brands and providing technical support to customers, particularly those that are small and mid-sized, as well as larger customers through our strategic accounts program;


• | We develop compelling value propositions in various end markets by providing core commodity products, core specialty products and value-added services to target certain customer segments we believe can generate sustainable and profitable revenue growth;


• | We provide quarterly customer demand forecasting and visibility into the marketing and distribution of the suppliers’ products; and


• | We have leading pricing technology to capture maximum value for our suppliers' brands in the marketplace.

Product Line Management and Purchasing 

Our supplier relationships are managed by separate product management teams within our Chemicals and Plastics lines of business. These teams focus on developing and maintaining supplier relationships, monitoring existing product lines and trends, and analyzing potential new products. Product management teams work in close coordination with our sales and marketing teams, allowing them to quickly and effectively identify customer buying and demand trends.


Our purchasing department is generally responsible for executing purchase orders to suppliers through our ERP system. For the majority of our operations, this system provides a centralized control platform throughout the entire supply chain, enabling the purchasing department to optimize procurement decisions. See "—Proprietary Operating Systems" below.
Contracts

Our supply agreements allow flexibility, to help ensure product availability and our ability to set the specific terms of any purchase in accordance with prevailing market conditions. The agreements include commonly expected general terms and conditions such as volume expectations, pricing, price change mechanisms and guidelines for conflict resolution. Many of the agreements with key suppliers also provide for rebates upon achievement of specified volume purchase levels. Purchase prices are generally market-based and fluctuate in accordance with the costs of the relevant raw materials. We do not usually enter into contracts that are non-terminable, are "take or pay" or have other similar requirements.
Global Distribution Channels
We are organized around the philosophy that key operating processes, such as demand forecasting, purchasing and supplier selection, can be optimized for cost and efficiency when concentrated in a centralized business model. Accordingly, we operate our distribution network under a "hub-and-spoke" model by processing large volumes of inventory at our main regional hubs and shipping them to smaller local warehouses on a demand-driven basis from where they are delivered to customers. Products are transported to smaller customers in mixed truckloads or less-than-truckload quantities.
Facilities

Our facilities are strategically placed to optimize route density in an effort to balance high-quality customer service with execution costs. In North America, we operate several "hub-and-spoke" models as described above. We believe this model is beneficial, as it enables us to efficiently aggregate customer demand, and allows us to match a large number of suppliers and customers at a lower cost. This system also supports economies of scale, a key driver of our profitability, as the aggregation of inventory at the "hubs" reduces inventory procurement costs and permits fleet optimization and efficient route planning through shipment consolidation and frequent deliveries to the "spokes." During fiscal year 2018, these facilities served approximately 21,200 customers.

In EMEA, our international plastics business operates through 23 third party operated warehouses and eight sales offices. These warehouses are located across EMEA, and during fiscal year 2018 they served approximately 4,400 customers. 
In Asia, our international chemicals and plastics businesses operate through 16 third party operated warehouses and eight sales offices. These warehouses are located in China and served approximately 1,700 customers during fiscal year 2018.

The following table lists each of the active distribution facilities we own or lease and does not include third party operated facilities. We classify a facility as a "bulk facility" if it is engaged in delivering goods in bulk to our customers.

(1)  During the first half of fiscal year 2019, we plan to acquire the land currently being leased. 

Our principal executive offices are located in The Woodlands, Texas. We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current operations.
Private Fleet

Transportation of products to and from customers and suppliers is a fundamental component of our business. During fiscal year 2018, our North American distribution service relied on our private fleet of trucks, tankers and trailers for 69.4% of volume delivered from our warehouses to our customers. We relied on common carriers for the remainder of our deliveries.

At September 30, 2018, our private fleet consisted of 1,110 owned and leased units that carry solid, bulk and liquid materials.

Private Fleet Characteristics as of September 30, 2018

Vehicle Type | Number of Vehicles | Average Age (years) | | Average TransportCapacity (lbs.)
Tractors | 352 | | 4 | | 45,000
Bulk Liquid Tankers | 400 | | 16 | | 42,000
Van Trailers | 345 | | | | 45,000
Dry Bulk Trailers | | | 9 | | 45,000


In addition, we currently lease approximately 400 railcars, which are primarily used for supplier shipments to our locations, stock transfers between our locations and occasional shipments to customers.
Our private fleet characteristics change constantly based on our market needs. We believe that we maintain an advantage over many of our competitors with our private fleet enterprise wide on-time delivery percentage of 98.8%. Our private fleet permits us to meet our customers’ demand and reduces their inventory risk through "just-in-time" delivery. Moreover, our ability to service our customers is less encumbered by the commercial transportation market providing reliability of service to customers, especially during periods of undersupply.

Direct Supply

In certain circumstances, we deliver full truckloads or large quantities of commodity products directly from a supplier to a customer, primarily via common carrier, and provide sourcing and supply chain support in connection with the delivery. Although the products move directly from supplier to customer, we remain the sole point of contact for both the customer and the supplier and generally take ownership of the products while in transit, bearing the risk of loss during transportation. Direct supply sales accounted for 18.1% of sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
Sales and Marketing

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, we served approximately 27,300 customers from a broad range of end markets resulting in approximately 480,000 orders for nearly 24,000 products. We have developed a sales and marketing organization with a broad scope of sales coverage to ensure we can service a diverse customer base.

As of September 30, 2018, our sales team consisted of approximately 510 sales professionals situated throughout North America, EMEA and Asia, including customer-facing personnel, such as technical support and corporate account managers, located in local markets. There are approximately 400 sales professionals based in North America, while approximately 60 sales professionals are based in EMEA and 50 sales professionals are based in Asia.
Our sales force compensation and incentive structure is designed to ensure alignment between the goals of the sales representatives and those of our overall business. All sales representatives earn a fixed base salary and variable rewards based on performance. We believe sales force compensation alignment is a key driver for the success of our business.


Customer Pricing Processes

We use data-driven pricing strategies, which enable our product managers to determine product pricing through the use of systems and tools that provide insight on relative market pricing across a number of factors including end markets, geography, packaging type and volume. Product managers, whose main responsibility is to cultivate and build supplier relationships, also develop a broad understanding of suppliers’ product offerings and the market’s needs. We have empowered these managers to make pricing decisions, working closely with our sales team to structure pricing for an optimal balance of price and volume to maximize profitability. The following is a description of our customers by line of business:

• | Chemicals. Our Chemicals customer base ranges from some of the largest global companies to smaller regional, private companies. Generally, no single Chemicals customer accounts for more than 5.0% of Chemicals sales, annually, while the five largest customers by value represent less than 10.0% of Chemicals sales on an annual basis. 


• | Plastics. Our Plastics customer base is diverse and serves a variety of end markets. Generally, no single Plastics customer accounts for more than 5.0% of Plastics sales, annually, while the five largest customers by value represent less than 5.0% of Plastics sales on an annual basis. 


• | Environmental Services. Our Environmental Services line of business includes customers who generate hazardous and non-hazardous waste in North America. One Environmental Services customer accounts for more than 5.0% but less than 10.0% of Environmental Services sales, annually, while the five largest customers generally account for less than 25.0% of Environmental Services sales on an annual basis. 

Contracts

Our customer contracts for the sale of chemicals and plastics products are generally framework agreements that do not contain an obligation to buy or sell. We use the agreements to define the general terms and conditions of sale and set volume expectations, pricing and price change mechanisms. The final terms of sale for each purchase are negotiated at the time of sale unless otherwise established by the terms of the contract. Consistent with industry standards, we may offer volume-based incentives to large customers if the customer purchases a specified volume with us over a specified time period. Our customer contracts for the provision of environmental services are generally framework agreements pursuant to which we provide environmental services from time to time, with fees agreed at the time the service is provided. These contracts are generally terminable by either party with or without cause upon 30 days’ notice. Additionally, our on-site environmental services contracts are typically term-based arrangements, with fee structures negotiated at the time of execution. 

Value-Added Services

In addition to our products, we provide a range of value-added services, including mixing and blending to specific customer requirements, lab testing and analysis, formulating, repackaging from large to small quantities, vendor inventory management and technical support. We continue to seek opportunities to profitably expand our value-added services to differentiate our value proposition and create competitive advantages.

Three key services we offer are repackaging, custom blending and lab services. Our hub facilities handle large quantities of materials, usually receiving shipments by railcar or tank truck. Bulk deliveries are often repackaged into smaller containers, such as gaylords, totes and drums, which are in turn delivered to customers by truck. Our custom blending capabilities include buying in bulk from our large base of suppliers, lab testing for product customization and blending of numerous products to meet customer specifications. Our labs provide product testing services to our customers in the form of chemical analysis and product performance analysis. We employ a team of scientists and experienced formulation experts to help customers with product development, failure analysis and other technical support in a broad range of chemical and product applications. 

Proprietary Operating Systems
We have developed a highly scalable technology platform with a centralized system and robust data analytics. These highly sophisticated systems enhance operational flexibility and facilitate the volume of customer orders, global sourcing, customer relations, distribution-related logistics, regulatory compliance, risk management controls and financial reporting. The operating platform consists of our transportation management system, pricing system, digital marketing, customer portal and ERP system. Our ERP system is used across the Company, with the exception of our subsidiary in China. The advanced data gathering and analysis capabilities of our ERP system, and the efficiencies it provides, enable us to operate flexibly and create significant advantages across the supply chain. Our ERP system also provides advanced volume forecasting, enabling us to forecast rolling weekly volumes, anticipate demand shift fluctuations and quickly respond to rapidly changing customer needs. This capability helps our suppliers by providing reliable and accurate demand forecasts that result in improved efficiency, flexibility and faster execution. These daily forecasts also translate into better pricing as they allow for optimization of production schedules. We believe that continuous automation implementation drives operational excellence and productivity.
Seasonality

Seasonal changes may affect our business and results of operations. We serve a large number of customers in a broad range of end markets and our business trends follow the seasonality patterns exhibited by these end markets and customers. For example, we generally tend to realize lower sales across all of our lines of business in the fourth calendar quarter of each year (which is our first fiscal quarter) because industrial production tends to be seasonally lower during that period. Our business may also be affected by our suppliers’ decisions regarding seasonal capacity and production.
Competition

The chemicals and plastics distribution markets in which we operate are highly fragmented. The primary competitive factors affecting each of our lines of business are the diversity and quality of the product portfolio, service offerings, reliability of services and supply, technical support and price and delivery capabilities. In addition, producers represent another source of competition, as many elect to distribute products through direct sales as opposed to indirect distributors. For some of the markets in which we operate, if large chemical producers elect to limit or consolidate their outsourcing of distribution, partner with other distributors, or distribute their products directly to end-user customers, competition would increase. Additionally, competition could increase from producers reducing their level of distribution outsourcing to maintain profit margin during periods of poor macroeconomic factors and pricing weakness, particularly for commodity products that require nominal service complexity to the end-user customer. We believe that our reputation, our broad range of product offerings and our speed and responsiveness, coupled with our valued-added services and the breadth of our distribution network, allow us to compete effectively and achieve scale benefits.
Chemicals

Our principal Chemicals distribution competitors include Azelis, Brenntag AG, Helm, ICC Chemicals, IMCD and Univar Inc. Additionally, our Chemicals line of business competes with many regional and local companies throughout North America as well as a number of smaller companies in certain niche markets.
Plastics

Our primary Plastics distribution competitors in North America are Channel Prime Alliance, Entec Polymers, M. Holland Company and PolyOne Distribution. Our primary Plastics competitors in EMEA are Albis, Biesterfeld, Distrupol and two divisions of Ravago: Resinex and Ultrapolymers. Our primary Plastics competitors in Asia are KDF, Nagase and Sinochem.
Environmental Services

The primary competitors of our Environmental Services line of business are Clean Harbors, Heritage, Univar Inc. and Veolia.

Employees

At September 30, 2018, we had approximately 2,760 employees worldwide, with approximately 2,190 employees in the U.S., 100 employees in Canada, 180 employees in EMEA, 120 employees in Asia, and 170 employees in Latin America. In the U.S., approximately 150 of our employees are represented by unions in six locations representing seven bargaining units, five of which are affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and two of which are affiliated with the United Steelworkers. 
Regulatory Matters

We are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governments and similar international agencies relating to the sale and distribution of our products. These regulations govern the use, labeling, packaging, transportation, storage and distribution of chemicals and hazardous substances. We are also subject to domestic and international import, export and customs regulations, and statutes and regulations relating to government contracting. In addition, we are subject to extensive environmental laws and other regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to land, and water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste in various federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions, including EMEA and Asia. We are also subject to other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding health and safety matters. Below is a summary of certain of these regulations.
Environmental

We operate in a number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions and are subject to various types of governmental regulation relating to the protection of the environment. Such regulation comes in the form of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning such issues as the handling, storage and transportation of chemicals, release of pollutants into the air, soil and water, disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, remediation of contaminated sites, protection of workers from exposure to hazardous substances and the public disclosure of information regarding environmental hazards. Some aspects of our businesses also require us to maintain various environmental permits and licenses. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits; however, environmental compliance costs in the form of compliance with regulations, remediation obligations, capital improvements, operating expenses and/or limitations on operations can be substantial.

Many of the environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations relate to the prevention and remediation of impacts to air, soil or water resulting from the release of regulated materials. Past operations at some of our facilities have resulted in the contamination of soil and groundwater, some of which require remediation. Under the ADA Purchase Agreement, Ashland retained liability for remediation obligations known prior to March 31, 2011 related to Ashland's ownership and operation of the Distribution Business. In addition, Ashland retained liability for all other environmental remediation liabilities arising prior to March 31, 2011 for which Ashland received notice on or before March 31, 2016. After March 31, 2016, we assumed responsibility for all newly reported contamination and are required to indemnify Ashland should Ashland incur any expense related to such newly reported contamination. In situations where Ashland does not fulfill its indemnification obligations to us, we may be responsible for substantial remediation costs at or associated with our facilities or with the Distribution Business.

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act

In the U.S., CERCLA and analogous state laws regulate the remediation of certain contaminated sites and establish liability for the release of hazardous substances and related damages to natural resources from such sites. Under CERCLA, potentially responsible parties (including waste generators, waste transporters, and parties arranging for waste disposal) are subject to strict and, in certain circumstances, joint and several liability, for the cost of remediating contaminated sites. Our Chemicals and Environmental Services lines of business conduct waste disposal activities and handle products which could subject us to CERCLA liability.

In addition, we currently indemnify some of our Environmental Services customers for liabilities related to waste disposal activities that such customers may incur under certain environmental laws, including CERCLA.


Resource Conservation and Recovery Act

RCRA and analogous state laws regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste. RCRA also establishes the regulatory framework for the management of certain non-hazardous wastes. RCRA requires owners and operators of hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities to obtain a RCRA permit. These permits may include both remedial actions and operational conditions. RCRA requires owners and operators of regulated facilities to investigate and remediate hazardous waste releases and to demonstrate compliance with financial assurance requirements. The financial assurance requirements are designed to ensure that adequate financial resources exist to respond to any releases of hazardous wastes at a permitted site and to perform any necessary corrective action and permanent site closure activities. Several of our facilities are subject to RCRA permits and some are undergoing corrective action to address previous releases of regulated materials as required under their permits. While we were required to assume responsibility for corrective action at a few sites in connection with the transfer of the business from Ashland to the Predecessor, Ashland, pursuant to the ADA Purchase Agreement, agreed to continue to perform certain known ongoing corrective actions at these sites until they are completed and to indemnify the Predecessor for any costs necessary to complete these actions. However, we retain responsibility for any RCRA violations resulting from our own operations. 
Clean Air Act

CAA and analogous state laws establish a variety of programs designed to regulate the discharge of pollutants into the air. Under these laws, permits may be required before construction can commence on any new or modified source that has the potential to emit a significant amount of any regulated pollutant, such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds. Additionally, we may be required to register with state environmental agencies, monitor and report emissions, and install new or improved emission control equipment in certain situations, including for existing sources of air emissions. Furthermore, CAA may require that we obtain federal operating permits for any major sources of air pollution, which incorporate applicable pollution control requirements and require reporting and certification obligations. CAA also requires owners and operators of facilities that produce, handle, process, distribute, or store threshold quantities of chemicals to implement and update detailed risk management plans, which must be filed with and approved by the EPA. We could be required to incur additional expenditures to comply with CAA, including costs to install and operate emissions control equipment at our facilities.
Clean Water Act

The EPA regulates discharges of pollutants into waters of the U.S. through the CWA. Pursuant to the CWA, the EPA establishes wastewater standards and water quality standards for contaminants discharged into surface waters such as streams, rivers and lakes. The discharge of any regulated pollutant from point sources (such as pipes and manmade ditches) into the waters of the U.S. is prohibited without a state or federally issued discharge permit. Several of our facilities are currently subject to and must comply with CWA permit limitations on the discharge of industrial wastewater and storm water.
Toxic Substances Control Act

The TSCA authorizes the EPA to require chemical manufacturers, importers, and exporters to comply with reporting, record keeping, testing, and other requirements relating to chemical substances or mixtures. The TSCA is primarily designed to ensure that certain chemicals do not pose an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment. The TSCA Chemical Substances Inventory, which is maintained by the EPA, lists approximately 85,000 covered chemical substances. Before a chemical substance can enter interstate commerce (either through manufacture or importation), the EPA must review and approve the substance’s pre-manufacture notice. As part of that review process, the EPA may identify conditions—up to and including a ban on production—limiting the use of a chemical substance before it enters commerce. The TSCA also requires the testing of chemicals by manufacturers, importers and processors and requires those importing or exporting chemicals to comply with certification reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The TSCA also requires that any chemical distributor having information reasonably suggesting a substantial risk of injury to health or the environment notify the EPA immediately. The TSCA reform legislation enacted in June 2016 expanded the EPA's authority to review and regulate new and existing chemicals. In addition, when we import chemicals into the U.S. or export chemicals out of the U.S., we must comply with the TSCA’s import certification and export notice requirements. We must also comply with the TSCA’s various recordkeeping requirements.
Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act

The EPCRA requires facilities manufacturing, processing, or storing designated hazardous chemicals to report certain information about their products to state and local officials and fire departments. These reporting obligations are intended to assist state and local governments in developing emergency response plans in the case of a chemical release and to provide information to the public regarding the type and amount of toxic or hazardous chemicals stored at a particular facility. In addition, facilities releasing toxic chemicals into the environment above certain thresholds must report such releases to the EPA as part of the facilities’ "Toxics Release Inventory." Because many of our chemical distribution facilities handle hazardous chemicals, we are subject to the reporting requirements under the EPCRA.
Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards

DHS regulates the security of certain high-risk chemicals facilities through CFATS. CFATS utilizes a Chemical Security Assessment Tool to identify those chemical facilities potentially deemed "high risk." The first step is user registration, followed by the completion of a top-screen evaluation. The top-screen evaluation analyzes whether a facility stores regulated chemicals above specified thresholds. If it does, the facility must complete a Security Vulnerability Assessment, which examines the likelihood that a threat against a facility will be successful. From there, the facility must develop a Site Security Plan to respond to any identified security vulnerabilities. The Site Security Plan must address such matters as access control, personnel credentialing, recordkeeping, employee training, emergency response, testing of security equipment, reporting of security incidents and suspicious activity, and deterring, detecting and delaying potential attacks. DHS must review and approve or deny all Security Vulnerability Assessments and Site Security Plans. CFATS also requires regulated facilities to keep detailed security records and allow DHS the right to enter, inspect, and audit the property, equipment, operations and records of such facilities. Our facilities handle a number of chemical substances subject to CFATS security requirements, and thus, some of our facilities must comply with its site security requirements. Other legislative and regulatory initiatives designed to minimize the vulnerability of chemical storage and transportation assets could result in increased regulation of our industry, potentially imposing additional limitations on our operations and causing us to incur higher operating and compliance costs.

Regulation of the Transportation of Hazardous Materials

The transportation of hazardous materials is a significant part of our business and is regulated by the Department of Transportation under the FHMTL and its implementing regulations, the HMR. The HMR regulate the handling of hazardous materials, hazardous wastes, hazardous substances, and marine pollutants, and establish rules applicable to myriad aspects of the transportation process, including employee training, incident notification, labeling and placarding of shipments, shipment preparation, carriage of hazardous materials, emergency response and the development of safety and security plans. Several Department of Transportation agencies, including the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the U.S. Coast Guard share responsibility for enforcing the FHMTL.
Certain international standards and regulations also govern the transportation of hazardous materials shipments within, to, and from the U.S. Such regulations include the International Civil Aviation Organization’s 132 Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air, the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code, Transport Canada’s Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations and the International Atomic Energy Agency Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials. These standards and regulations prescribe, among other things, requirements for packaging, maximum weight and handling of hazardous materials. U.S. agencies have sought to harmonize their rules with international standards and regulations, but when hazardous materials are transported to, from, and within the U.S. in accordance with one or more of these international standards or regulations, U.S. HMR requirements must still be followed.

The majority of our logistics services, including transport of hazardous materials, involve highway transportation. The Transportation Security Administration requires any driver seeking to obtain, renew, or transfer a hazardous materials endorsement on a state-issued commercial driver’s license to undergo a security threat assessment. Additionally, under the Transportation Worker Identification Credential program, workers, including truckers, requiring unescorted access to maritime facilities must be issued tamper-resistant biometric credentials to access such facilities.


Like environmental regulations, the regulations governing the transportation of hazardous materials are often subject to modification. Compliance with new regulations on the transportation of hazardous materials could adversely affect our business by raising our compliance and operational costs.

Occupational Safety and Health Regulations

We are subject to the OSH Act, which addresses safety and health in workplace environments. In addition to the OSH Act, we are subject to applicable state occupational safety and health regulations as well as the safety and health rules of applicable jurisdictions outside of the U.S, such as the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System in Canada.
The OSH Act is administered by OSHA, which has established maximum workplace chemical exposure levels. Manufacturers and distributors of chemicals must employ a hazard communication program utilizing labels and other forms of warnings, as well as safety data sheets, setting forth safety and hazardous materials information to employees and customers. OSHA’s Hazard Communication Standard covers both physical hazards (such as flammability or the potential for explosions) and health hazards. Employers are required to provide a certain level of training to ensure that relevant employees are equipped to properly handle chemicals. OSHA has modified its Hazard Communication Standard to make it consistent with the United Nation’s Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals. The new standards include more specific requirements for hazard classification, as well as standardized label components that provide consistent information and definitions for hazardous chemicals and a standard approach to conveying information on safety data sheets. Our Chemicals line of business has already completed its transition to the revised Hazard Communication Standard. 
Our Chemicals line of business in Canada has completed the transition to Health Canada's Globally Harmonized System - aligned Hazardous Products Regulations standard.
Both the U.S. and Canada Hazard Communication Standards remain subject to periodic updates and revisions, and those changes, as well as other regulatory initiatives in occupational health and safety, could result in increased operation and compliance costs.

Product Control
We operate in a number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions and are subject to various types of governmental regulation relating to use, labeling, packaging, storage and distribution of chemicals and hazardous substances. Statutes and regulations governing the import, export and control of our products are enforced by government agencies such as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Transportation, the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture and similar international agencies.
We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with federal, state and local regulations relating to the sale, distribution, import and export of our products. We have automated systems, processes and procedures in place to support compliance with these regulations, and because we have these automated systems, processes and procedures in place, we believe we conduct our global business in compliance in all material respects with applicable statutes and regulations as promulgated in the countries into which we sell our products. Although we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any non-compliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to conduct our business.
Intellectual Property

We are not substantially dependent upon patents, trademarks or licenses.


Insurance

Our operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in the transportation, storage and disposal of chemicals and other potentially hazardous materials. We seek to mitigate these risks with effective industry-specific risk management techniques that include continuing and improving upon current loss prevention, claims management and training programs as well as a comprehensive insurance program. We have insurance coverage at levels that we consider adequate for our worldwide facilities and activities. Our insurance policies cover, among others, the following categories of risk: property damage and business interruption; marine cargo throughput, product and general liability; environmental liability; directors’ and officers’ liability and fraud and crime/theft.
