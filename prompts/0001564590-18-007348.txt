Ponce Bank
 Ponce Bank is a federally-chartered stock savings association headquartered in the Bronx, New York. Ponce Bank was originally chartered in 1960 as a federally-chartered mutual savings and loan association under the name Ponce De Leon Federal Savings and Loan Association. In 1985, the Bank changed its name to “Ponce De Leon Federal Savings Bank.” In 1997, the Bank changed its name again to “Ponce De Leon Federal Bank.” The Bank is designated as a Minority Depository Institution under applicable regulations.
 Business is conducted at our administrative center and 13 banking offices. The banking offices are located in Bronx (5 branches), Manhattan (2 branches), Queens (3 branches) and Brooklyn (3 branches), New York, and one branch in Union City, New Jersey.
 The Bank’s business consists primarily of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, in mortgage loans consisting of one-to-four family real estate, including  residential owner-occupied and investor-owned, multifamily residential, nonresidential property, construction and land, and, to a lesser extent, business and consumer loans. Subject to market conditions, we expect to increase our focus on multifamily and nonresidential loans in an effort to grow our overall loan portfolio, increase the overall yield earned on our loans and assist in managing interest rate risk. We also invest in securities, which have historically consisted primarily of securities issued by the U.S. Government and federal agencies and mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. We offer a variety of deposit accounts, including checking accounts, savings accounts and certificate of deposit accounts.  We also use alternative funding sources such as borrowings and brokered and listing service deposits to complement our existing funding base.

Market Area
 We are headquartered in the Bronx, New York, with our primary market in the boroughs of New York City (excluding Staten Island) and Hudson County, New Jersey. The size and complex nature of the geographic footprint makes for diverse demographics that continue to undergo significant changes, in terms of economic, racial, ethnic and age parameters, all with potentially substantial long-term institutional ramifications. 
 Our primary deposit base includes a large and stable base of locally employed blue-collar workers with low-to-medium income, middle-aged, and with limited investment funds. Within the base of locally employed blue-collar workers there is a significant, and growing, portion of recently immigrated, younger, lower-skilled laborers. The influx of immigrant lower-skilled workers, however, has been hampered by the increases in rental rates in the rental housing market within the New York City metropolitan area. 
 Another significant customer segment consists of middle aged and older white-collar, high-income individuals, many of whom are self-employed real estate investors and developers. They constitute a large percentage of the borrowing base of the Bank and, increasingly, are becoming the source of a significant percentage of commercial deposits. 
 The Bank historically has been funded through local community deposits. Today, the Bank continues to rely primarily on community deposits from its market areas to fund investments and loans. However, the mix of community deposits now includes consumer and commercial deposits but with a strong reliance on time deposits. 
 Until we expanded our branch network, our Bronx-based image and emphasis on personal services to minorities allowed us to maintain adequate market standing in consumer deposits and mortgage loans. The Bank’s branch expansion and the gentrification of substantial parts of New York City altered our competitive landscape. The branch expansion resulted in primarily one-time increases in our deposit base. 
 
Competition
 The Bank faces significant competition within its market areas both in making loans and attracting deposits. There is a high concentration of financial institutions in the Bank’s market area, including national, regional and other locally-operated commercial banks, savings banks, savings associations and credit unions. Several “mega” banks exist in the market, such as JPMorgan Chase, Citibank and Capital One, many of whom are making a new push for retail deposits. A number of our competitors offer products and services that the Bank does not currently offer, such as trust services, private banking, insurance services and asset management. Additionally, the Bank faces an increasing level of competition from non-core financial service providers that do not necessarily maintain a physical presence in the Bank’s market area, such as Quicken Loans, Freedom Mortgage and many internet financial service providers. The litany of competitors facing the Bank is extensive. 
 
Deposit market share in the New York area can be difficult to quantify, as some “mega” banks will include large scale deposits from around the world as held at headquarters. However, in Bronx County, New York, where the Bank maintains five branches, it holds 1.88% (June 30, 2017) of the market’s deposits. This represents the Bank’s largest market share in a county level area. Generally speaking, the Bank has been able to grow deposits at about the same rates as its respective markets of operation. For example, between December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, the Queens County market increased 7%, and the Bank grew deposits at its branches in tandem with that rate. The Bank will continue to work to improve its market position by expanding its brand within its current market, and building its capacity to provide more products and services to its customer base.
 
Lending Activities
 General. Our principal lending activity is originating one-to-four family real estate, including residential investor-owned and owner-occupied, multifamily residential, nonresidential property, construction and land, and, to a lesser extent, business and consumer loans.. To a much lesser extent, we also originate commercial and industrial (“C&I”) business loans and consumer loans. We originate real estate and other loans through our loan officers, marketing efforts, our customer base, walk-in customers and referrals from real estate brokers, builders and attorneys. Subject to market conditions and our asset-liability analysis, we seek to increase our emphasis on multifamily and nonresidential loans in an effort to grow our overall loan portfolio and increase the overall yield earned on our loans. 
 2

Lending activities are conducted primarily by our salaried loan personnel operating at our main and branch office locations including our loan officers. We also conduct lending activities throughout subsidiary Ponce De Leon Mortgage Corporation.  All loans originated by us are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures. We currently intend that substantially all of our mortgage loan originations will be with adjustable interest rates. For our business loan originations, variable rate pricing is offered based on prime rate, plus margin.

One-to-four Family Investor-Owned Loans. At $287.2 million, or 35.5%, of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017, investor-owned mortgage loans secured by non-owner-occupied one-to-four family residential represent the Bank’s largest lending category. The majority of this portfolio, $246.8 million, or 85.9% are two-to-four family properties (431 accounts), while the remaining $40.4 million, or 14.1%, are primarily single family, non-owner-occupied investment properties (107 accounts). The three largest loans in this category are $4.9 million, $3.2 million and $3.1 million. In this category, loans totaling $120.4 million, or 41.8%, are secured by properties located in Queens County, $98.1 million, or 34.1%, in Kings County, $25.8 million, or 9.0%, in Bronx County, and $19.4 million, or 6.7%, in New York County. The rest of this category, less than 9.0%, is spread out in other counties and no other concentration exceeded $7.0 million or 5.0%. 
 One-to-four family investor-owned real estate loans involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family owner-occupied real estate loans. Rather than depending on the borrower’s repayment ability from employment or other income, the borrower’s repayment ability is primarily dependent on ensuring that a tenant occupies the investor property and has the financial capacity to pay sufficient rent to cover the borrower’s debt. In addition, if an investor borrower has several loans secured by properties in the same market, the loans have risks similar to a multifamily real estate loan and repayment of those loans is subject to adverse conditions in the rental market or the local economy. 
 The Bank imposes strict underwriting guidelines in the origination of such loans, including lower maximum loan-to-value ratios of 70% on purchases and 65% on refinances, a required minimum debt service coverage ratio (net operating income divided by debt service requirement) of 1.20x that must be met by either the property on a standalone basis, or by the inclusion of the owner(s) as co-borrower(s). In addition, all such loans currently require that the transaction exhibit a global debt service coverage ratio (net operating income divided by debt service requirement) of no less than 1.0x. This coverage ratio indicates that the owner has the capacity to support the loan along with all of his personal obligations. On occasion, the Bank has required that the borrower establish a cash reserve to be held at the Bank in order to provide additional security. The maximum term on such loans is 30 years, typically with five year adjustable rates.

One-to-four Family Owner-occupied Loans. Lending in this category totaled $100.9 million, or 12.5% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017. None of the loans in this category exceeded $2.0 million in outstanding balances, with the three largest having $1.8 million, $1.6 million and $1.5 million in outstanding balances. There are only 17 loans with an outstanding balance in excess of $1.0 million, which in total account for less than 20% of this category. At December 31, 2017, approximately 39.1% of this category is secured by properties located in Queens County and 10.8% in New York County. None of the other geographical concentrations exceeded 10% of this category. 
 It is the Bank’s policy to underwrite loans secured by one-to-four family owner-occupied residential real estate in a manner that ensures strict compliance with Dodd-Frank regulatory requirements. This includes underwriting only mortgages that have a debt-to-income ratio of 43% or less. That is the highest ratio a borrower can have and still receive qualified mortgage. A qualified mortgage is presumed to meet the borrower’s ability to repay the loan. As part of this effort, the Bank employs software that tests each loan for compliance. 
 The Bank generally limits loans in this category to a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 90% for a purchase and 80% for a refinance, based on the lower of the purchase price or appraised value. The maximum loan term is 30 years, self-amortizing. Being that the Bank is a portfolio lender, it presently does not offer a fixed-rate product. The Bank currently offers mostly 5/1 and 5/5 adjustable rate loans that adjust based on a spread ranging between 2.75% to 3.00% over the one-or five-year Federal Home Loan Bank of New York rate. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may increase generally is limited to 2% for the first two adjustments and 5% for the life of the loan.
 Multifamily and Non-Residential Lending. At $188.6 million, or 23.3% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017, mortgages secured by multifamily properties represent the Bank’s second largest lending concentration. The nonresidential portfolio accounts for $151.2 million, or 18.7%, of the total loan portfolio, and represents the third largest concentration.  Combined, the multifamily and non-residential loan portfolios amount to $339.7 million, or 42.0% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017.  The three largest loans were $7.3 million, $4.9 million and $3.3 million, with the largest being a multifamily residential building, and the other two being nonresidential. Of the total of $339.7 million, 97 loans have balances in excess of $1.0 million and account for $196.2 million, or approximately 57.8%, of this lending concentration. In terms of geographical concentrations, $144.9 million, or 42.6%, are secured by properties located in Queens County, $66.1 million, or 19.5%, in Bronx County, $55.0 million, or 16.2%, in Kings County, $19.5 million, or 5.8%, in New York County and $19.1 million, or 5.8%, in Westchester County. All other concentrations by county, which account for less than 16.0% of this category, have balances of $10.0 million or less.  In the nonresidential portfolio, $34.4 million is classified as owner-used, owner-occupied. The overall mix is diverse in terms of property types, with the largest concentration being retail and wholesale at $53.3 million, or 35.3%, of the portfolio, industrial and warehouse at $27.9 million, or 18.5%, service, doctor, dentist, beauty, etc. at $21.3 million or 14.1%, offices at $18.0 million, or 11.9%, churches at $11.9 million, or 7.8%, restaurants at $9.6 million, or 6.4%, and hotels and motels at $6.4 million, or 4.2%. The rest of the portfolio accounts for other property types, with none exceeding 1.0% as a portfolio concentration.
 The Bank considers a number of factors in originating multifamily and nonresidential mortgages. Loans secured by multifamily and nonresidential real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family residential real estate loans. The primary concern in this type of lending is the borrower’s creditworthiness and the viability and cash flow potential of the project. Payments on loans secured by income-producing properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy as compared to residential real estate loans. To address the risks involved, the Bank evaluates the qualifications and financial resources of the underlying principal of the borrower, including credit history, profitability and expertise, as well as the value of cash flows and condition of the property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, the Bank considers the financial resources of the borrower, the underlying principal of the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar properties and the borrower’s payment history with the Bank and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors considered include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value or purchase price of the mortgaged property (whichever is lower), and the debt service coverage ratio. All multifamily and non-residential loans are supported by appraisals that conform to the Bank’s appraisal policy. The Bank generally limits the maximum loan-to-value ratio on these loans to 75%, based on the lower of the purchase price or appraised value of the subject property (70% on the refinance of nonresidential properties such as retail spaces, office buildings, and warehouses). The maximum loan term ranges between 25 and 30 years. As is the Bank’s general policy, the Bank offers only adjustable rates on its multifamily and nonresidential mortgages - with adjustments based on a spread currently ranging between 2.75% to 3.00% over the five-year Federal Home Loan Bank of New York rate.

Construction and Land Lending. Construction and land lending totaled $67.2 million, or 8.3%, of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017, (29 projects) with the majority consisting of multifamily residential projects (21 projects). Out of the $67.2 million, $61.2 million are multifamily, of which $30.2 million are secured by properties located in Kings County, $24.5 million in Queens County, $5.9 million in Bronx County and $650,000 in New York County. At December 31, 2017, loans in process related to construction loans totaled $48.7 million. 
 The Bank’s typical construction loan has a term of up to 24 months and contains: 
  
• | a minimum of 5% contingency;
--+-----------------------------


• | a minimum of 5% retainage;
--+---------------------------


• | a loan-to-cost ratio of 70% or less;
--+-------------------------------------


• | an end loan loan-to-value ratio of 65% or less;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | an interest reserve;
--+---------------------


• | guarantees of all owners / partners / shareholders of a closely held organization owning 20% or more of company stock or entity ownership; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an option to convert to a permanent mortgage loan upon completion of the project.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Construction lending involves additional risks when compared with permanent lending because funds are advanced upon the security of the project, which is of uncertain value prior to its completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. The Bank’s approach to the underwriting of construction loans is driven by five factors: analysis of the developer; analysis of the contractor; analysis of the project; valuation of the project; and evaluation of the source of repayment. 
 The developer’s character, capacity and capital are analyzed to determine that the individual or entity has the ability to first complete the project and then either sell it or carry permanent financing. The general contractor is analyzed for reputation, sufficient expertise and capacity to complete the project within the allotted time. The project is analyzed in order to ensure that the project will be completed within a reasonable period of time according to the plans and specifications, and can either be sold, rented or refinanced once completed. All construction loans are supported by appraisals which conform to the Bank’s appraisal policy and affirm the value of the project both “As Is” and “As Completed”. Lastly, the Bank reviews the developer’s cash flow estimations for the project on an “As Completed” basis. These projections are compared to the appraiser’s estimates. Debt service coverage using projected rental net income must be at least 1.2x the estimated debt service when operating at stabilized levels. 
 Upon closing of the construction loan, the Bank begins monitoring the project and funding requisitions for completed stages upon inspection and confirmation by third party firms, such as engineers, of the work performed and its value and quality. Conversion to permanent financing usually occurs upon a conversion underwriting and receipt of certificates of occupancy, as applicable. 
 C&I Loans and Lines of Credit. C&I loans and lines of credit represent less than 2.0% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017. Unlike real estate loans, which are secured, and whose collateral value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial and industrial loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business. The collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. 
 Although the Bank’s loan policy allows for the extension of secured and unsecured financing, the Bank usually seeks to obtain collateral when in initial discussions with potential borrowers. Unsecured credit facilities are made only to strong borrowers that possess established track records with the Bank (or come highly recommended) and are supported by guarantors. Guarantees are required of any individual or entity owning or controlling 20% or more of the borrowing entity, with exceptions requiring approval from the Board of Directors. When credits are not secured by a specific lien on an asset, the Bank usually requires a general lien on all business assets as evidenced by a UCC filing. Pricing is typically based on the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus a spread driven by risk rating variables. 
 6

Underwriters are required to identify at least two sources of repayment, usually recommend that loans contain covenants, such as minimum debt service coverage ratios, minimum global debt service coverage ratios, maximum leverage ratios, 30-day “cleanups” or “clean-downs,” as applicable, and must require periodic financial reporting. In addition, every effort is made to set up borrowers with auto-debit for loan payments, and they are strongly encouraged to maintain operating accounts at the Bank. 
 Lines of credit are typically short term facilities (12 months) that are provided for occasional or seasonal needs. They are extended to only qualifying borrowers who have established cash flow from operations and a clean credit history. An annual 30-day clean-up, or 75% annual pay-down period is required. A clean-up period generally is not required on amortizing secured lines. Guarantors, which are usually required, must have clean credit histories and a substantial outside net worth. Most lines contain an option to convert to a term loan upon maturity. 
 Secured term loans are long term facilities extended typically for the purpose of financing the purchase of a long term asset. At a minimum, they will be collateralized by the asset being purchased. They may also be secured by an existing long term business asset or outside collateral pledged by the guarantor borrower. Unsecured term loans are usually extended only to well-known borrowers who have established, strong cash flow from operations and a clean credit history. Although Bank policy allows term loans for up to ten years, the preference is to offer self-amortizing term loans based on a term of no more than five to seven years.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority.  Our maximum loan to one borrower is 90% of the Bank’s legal lending limit, individually and cumulatively. At December 31, 2017, our internal lending limit to one borrower was $21.1 million. At December 31, 2017, our largest relationship was $16.3 million consisting of one multifamily construction project in Kings County, with an outstanding balance of $9.0 million. The second largest relationship was $14.0 million consisting of one multifamily construction project located in Queens County. No other loan or loans to one borrower, individually or cumulatively, exceeded $13.1 million, or 62% of our lending limit.

The Bank’s lending is subject to written policies, underwriting standards and operating procedures. Decisions on loan requests are made on the basis of detailed applications submitted by the prospective borrower, credit histories that we obtain and property valuations, consistent with our appraisal policy. The appraisals are prepared by outside independent licensed appraisers and reviewed by third parties, all approved by the Board of Directors. The Loan Committee usually reviews appraisals in considering a loan application.  The performance of the appraisers is also subject to internal evaluations using scorecards and are assessed periodically. The loan applications are designed primarily to determine the borrower’s ability to repay the requested loan, and all information provided with the application and provided checklists as part of the application package are thoroughly evaluated by the loan underwriting department. 
 The lending approval process starts with the processing of the application package, which is reviewed for completeness and then all necessary agency reports are ordered. Upon initial review and preparation of preliminary documents by the processors in the underwriting department, the file is assigned to an underwriter. The underwriters are responsible for presenting the loan request - with a recommendation - to the Loan Committee and then the Board of Directors, when the credit exposure is greater than the Loan Committee’s authority or there are exceptions to our loan policy. If approved, closed and booked, the loan reviewers then undertake the responsibility of monitoring the credit file for the life of the loan by assessing the borrower’s creditworthiness periodically, given certain criteria and following certain operating procedures. An independent third party also performs loan reviews following similar criteria and scope under the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 The Bank also offers smaller commercial and consumer loans of up to $250,000 that follow an “Express Approval” process based on certain underwriting guidelines. Express Approval loans require the signature of only three (3) Loan Committee members. 
 At this time, the Bank does not originate loans with the intent of selling them into the secondary market. 
 
Delinquencies and Non-Performing Assets
 
Delinquency Procedures. Collection efforts commence the day following the grace period, normally on the 17th of the month.  Those loans that have experienced sporadic late payments over the previous 12 months are to be reviewed with a greater degree of diligence.  Late notices are generated and distributed on the 17th and 30th day of the month.  The Collection Department will pursue collection efforts up until the 90th day past due. At that time, the Bank usually will institute legal proceedings for collection or foreclosure unless it is in the best interest of the Bank to work further with the borrower to arrange a suitable workout plan. 
 Prior to acquiring property as a result of foreclosure, the Bank will attain an updated appraisal to determine the fair market value and proceed with net adjustments according to accounting principles.  Board of Directors approval will be required.
 For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we collected $1.1 million and $159,270, respectively, of interest income on our non-accruing troubled debt restructured loans, of which we recognized $1.0 million and $26,193 into income, respectively. The remaining interest collected on our non-accruing troubled debt restructured loans for these periods was applied as a principal reduction for the remaining life of the loan, or until the loan is deemed performing.

Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities, considered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to be of lesser quality, as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the Bank will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss allowance is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as “special mention” by our management.
Under OCC regulations, when an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover probable accrued losses. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to cover probable accrued losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. 
 In connection with the filing of our periodic reports with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and in accordance with our classification of assets policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. 
 On the basis of this review of our loans, our classified and special mention loans at the dates indicated were as follows:

Troubled Debt Restructurings. We occasionally modify loans to help a borrower stay current on his or her loan and to avoid foreclosure. We consider modifications only after analyzing the borrower’s current repayment capacity, evaluating the strength of any guarantors based on documented current financial information, and assessing the current value of any collateral pledged. We generally do not forgive principal or interest on loans, but may do so if it is in our best interest and increases the likelihood that we can collect the remaining principal balance. We may modify the terms of loans to lower interest rates, which may be at below market rates, to provide for fixed interest rates on loans where fixed rates are otherwise not available, or to provide for interest-only terms. These modifications are made only when there is a reasonable and attainable workout plan that has been agreed to by the borrower and that is in our best interests.
 
At December 31, 2017, we had 49 loans totaling $18.4 million that were classified as troubled debt restructurings. Of these, ten loans totaling $4.6 million were included in our non-accrual loans at such date because they were not performing in accordance with their modified terms, and the remaining 39 loans, totaling $13.8 million, had been performing in accordance with their modified terms for a minimum of six months since the date of restructuring.

At December 31, 2016, we had 61 loans totaling $23.2 million (including three loans held-for-sale totaling $2.1 million) that were classified as troubled debt restructurings. Of these, ten loans totaling $4.8 million (including all three of our loans held-for-sale totaling $2.1 million) were included in our non-accrual loans at such date because they were not performing in accordance with their modified terms, and the remaining 51 loans, totaling $18.4 million, had been performing in accordance with their modified terms for a minimum of six months since the date of restructuring.

Allowance for Loan Losses 
 
The Bank has approved and maintained an appropriate, systematic and consistently applied process to determine the dollar amounts of the allowance for loan losses (“ALLL”) that is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio and other held financial instruments. An inherent loss, as defined by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), and applicable banking regulations, is an unconfirmed loss that probably exists based on the information that is available as of the evaluation date. It is not a loss that may arise from events that might occur as a result of a possible future event. Arriving at an appropriate allowance involves a high degree of management’s judgment, is inevitably imprecise, and results in a range of possible losses. 
 
The determination of the dollar amounts of the ALLL is based on management’s current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio taking into consideration all known relevant internal and external factors that affect loan payments at the end of each month. The dollar amounts reported each month for the ALLL are reviewed at least quarterly by the Board. To ensure that the methodology remains appropriate for the Bank, the Board periodically has the methodology validated externally and causes revisions to be made when appropriate. The Audit Committee oversees and monitors the internal controls over the ALLL determination process. The Bank adheres to a safe and sound banking practice by maintaining, analyzing, and supporting an adequate ALLL in accordance with GAAP and supervisory guidance. 
 
The Bank’s ALLL methodology consists of a system designed and implemented to estimate loan and lease losses. The Bank’s ALLL methodology incorporates management’s current judgments about the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio through a disciplined and consistently applied process. 
 
The Bank’s loan policy requires the following when the Bank calculates the level of ALLL: 
  
• | All loans shall be taken into consideration in the ALLL methodology whether on an individual or group basis.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Bank shall identify all loans to be evaluated for impairment on an individual basis under ASC 310 and segment the remainder of the loan portfolio into groups (pools) of loans with similar risk characteristics for evaluation and analysis under ASC 450.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | All known relevant internal and external factors that may affect the collection of the loan shall be taken into consideration.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 14

 
• | All known relevant internal and external factors that may affect loan collectability shall be considered and applied consistently; however, when appropriate, these factors may be modified for new factors affecting loan collectability.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The particular risks inherent in different kinds of lending shall be taken into consideration.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The current collateral values, less the costs to sell, shall be taken into consideration when applicable.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Bank shall require that competent and well-trained personnel perform the analysis, estimates, reviews and other ALLL methodology functions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ALLL methodology shall be based on current and reliable information.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ALLL methodology shall be well documented, in writing, with clear explanations of the supporting analyses and rationale.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ALLL methodology shall include a systematic and logical method to consolidate the loss estimates and ensure the ALLL balance is recorded in accordance with GAAP.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Loan pools with similar risk characteristics. Loss histories are the starting point for the calculation of ALLL balances. Loss histories are calculated for each of the pools by aggregating the historical losses less recoveries within the respective pools and annualizing the number over the determined length of time. The length of time may vary according to the relevance of past periods’ experience to the current period, among other considerations. The Bank currently uses a prior twelve quarter rolling average for its historical loss rates.
 
Each pool’s historical loss rate is adjusted for the effects of the qualitative or environmental factors. The factors analyzed include: 
  
• | Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Changes in international, national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of nonaccrual loans, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Changes in the quality of the Bank’s loan review system.
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The existence and effect of any concentration of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the institution’s existing portfolio.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Bank utilizes a risk-based approach to determine the appropriate adjustments for each qualitative factor. A matrix containing definitions of low, medium, and high risk levels is used to assess the individual factors to determine their respective directional characteristics. These risk levels serve as the foundation for determining the individual adjustments for each factor for each pool of loans. 
 15

The qualitative factor adjustments are supported by applicable reports, graphs articles and any other relevant information to evidence and document management’s judgment as to the respective levels of risk and adjustment requirements. 
 Each of the qualitative adjustment factors is applied to each of the loan pools to reflect adjustments that increase or decrease the historical loss rates applied to each loan pool. Each of these adjustment factors is individually supported and justified, and a discrete narrative for each loan pool reflects current information, events, circumstances and conditions influencing the adjustment. The narratives include descriptions of each factor, management’s analysis of how each factor has changed over time, which loan pool’s loss rates have been adjusted, the amount by which loss estimates have been adjusted for changes in conditions, an explanation of how management estimated the impact, and other available data that support the reasonableness of the adjustments. 
 Once these qualitative adjustment factors are determined for each pool of loans, they are added to the historical loss numbers for each corresponding pool of loans to arrive at a loss factor for each pool based on historical loss experience and qualitative or environmental influences. These loss factors are adjusted to appropriately reflect the respective risk rating categories within each pool by applying the weighting factors described above to those loans within the respective pool’s risk rates. 
 The series of calculations described above can be expressed as the following equation: 
 [(H*P) + (Q*P)] = R, where 
 H = Historical loss factor for the pool 
 Q = Qualitative/Environmental aggregate adjustment for the pool 
 P = Total loans within the pool 
 R = Required reserve amount for the risk rating category within the pool 
 
Specific allowances for identified problem loans. The Bank considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. All troubled debt restructurings and loans on non-accrual status are deemed to be impaired. A specific valuation allowance is established for the impairment amount of each loan, calculated using the present value of expected cash flows, observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral, in accordance with the most likely means of recovery. 
 Factors evaluated in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. The Bank determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. 
 An unallocated component may be maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect our estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating allocated and general reserves in the portfolio. 
 Validation of the ALLL. The Bank considers its ALLL methodology valid when it accurately estimates the amount of loss contained in the loan portfolio. The Bank has employed procedures, including the following, when validating the reasonableness of its ALLL methodology and determining whether there may be deficiencies in its overall methodology or loan grading process: 
  
• | A review of trends in loan volume, delinquencies, loan restructurings and concentrations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A review of previous charge-offs and recovery history, including an evaluation of the timeliness of the entries to record both the charge-offs and the recoveries.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | At a minimum, an annual review by a third party that is independent of the ALLL estimation process.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | An evaluation of the appraisal process of the underlying collateral.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 16

The Bank supports the independent validation process with the work papers from the ALLL review function and may include the summary findings of an independent reviewer. The Board reviews the findings and acknowledges its review in the minutes of its meeting. If the methodology is changed based upon the findings of the validation process, the documentation that describes and supports the changes is maintained. 
 As an integral part of its examination process, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Following such review, we may determine that it is appropriate to recognize additions to the allowance based on our judgment and information available to us at the time of such examination. 
 Current expected credit losses. On June 16, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued the current expected credit losses (“CECL”) standard. The new standard will have a pervasive impact on us. In response to the new model, we have reassessed our risk management policies and procedures in order for us to successfully implement CECL. Once adopted, we will have to estimate the allowance for loan losses on expected losses rather than incurred losses. 
 
The following table sets forth activity in our allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated.

At December 31, 2017, our allowance for loan losses represented 1.37% of total loans and 97.05% of nonperforming loans. The allowance for loan losses increased to $11.1 million at December 31, 2017 from $10.2 million at December 31, 2016. There were $850,000 in net loan charge-offs and $778,000 in net loan recoveries during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 18

Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Furthermore, while we believe that we have established our allowance for loan losses in conformity with GAAP, after a review of our loan portfolio by regulators, we may determine it is appropriate to increase our allowance for loan losses. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing allowance for loan losses may not be adequate and increases may be necessary should the quality of any loan deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
Investment Activities
 
General.  Our investment policy was adopted by the Board of Directors. The investment policy is reviewed annually by the Board of Directors. The Chief Financial Officer is designated as the Chief Investment Officer. The Chief Financial Officer will plan and execute investment strategies consistent with the policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Chief Financial Officer provides an investment schedule detailing the investment portfolio which is reviewed at least quarterly by the Bank’s asset-liability committee and the Board of Directors. 
 Our current investment policy permits, with certain limitations, investments in United States Treasury securities; securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies or government sponsored enterprises including mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”) issued by Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac; corporate bonds and obligations, and certificates of deposit in other financial institutions. 
 At December 31, 2017 and 2016, our investment portfolio consisted of securities and obligations issued by the U.S. government and government sponsored enterprises and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we owned $1.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of Federal Home Loan Bank of New York stock. As a member of Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, we are required to purchase stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, which stock is carried at cost and classified as restricted equity securities. 
 Securities Portfolio Composition. The following table sets forth the amortized cost and estimated fair value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio at the dates indicated, which consisted of U.S. government and federal agencies, pass-through mortgage-backed securities and certificates of deposit.

At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, there were no securities of which the amortized cost or estimated value exceeded 10% of our total equity.
 
Mortgage-Backed Securities. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had mortgage-backed securities with a carrying value of $4.3 million and $10.5 million, respectively. Mortgage-backed securities are securities issued in the secondary market that are collateralized by pools of mortgages. Certain types of mortgage-backed securities are commonly referred to as “pass through” certificates because the underlying loans are “passed through” to investors, net of certain costs, including servicing and guarantee fees. Mortgage-backed securities typically are collateralized by pools of one-to-four family or multifamily mortgages, although we invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities backed by one-to-four family mortgages. The issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors such as Ponce Bank. The interest rate of the security is lower than the interest rates of the underlying loans to allow for payment of servicing and guaranty fees. All of our mortgage-backed securities are backed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which are government-sponsored enterprises, or Ginnie Mae, which is a government-owned enterprise. 
 19

Residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises are more liquid than individual mortgage loans because there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize our borrowings. Investments in residential mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. Current prepayment speeds determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments. 
 Portfolio Maturities and Yields. The composition and maturities of the investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2017 are summarized in the following table. Maturities are based on the final contractual payment dates, and do not reflect the effect of scheduled principal repayments, prepayments, or early redemptions that may occur. Adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust.

Sources of Funds
 
General. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities.  We also may use borrowings, primarily from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, and brokered and listing service deposits, and unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks, to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk and to manage the cost of funds.  At December 31, 2017, the amount available to the Bank to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York was $24.0 million and another $2.0 million from a correspondent bank.  In addition, we receive funds from scheduled loan payments, investment maturities and calls, loan prepayments and income on earning assets.  While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition.
 Deposits. Our deposits are generated primarily from our primary market area. We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including demand accounts, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit to individuals, business entities, non-profit organizations and individual retirement accounts. Deposit account terms vary, with the primary differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. 
 Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and premature withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. We rely upon personalized customer service, long-standing relationships with customers, and the favorable image of the Bank in the community to attract and retain deposits. We recently implemented a fully functional electronic banking platform, including a mobile application, remote deposit capture and online bill pay, as a service to our retail and business customers. 
 The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and other prevailing interest rates and competition. Additionally, the ability to attract and maintain deposits and the rates paid on these deposits, has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions.

 At December 31, 2017, our passbook savings accounts and certificates of deposit with a passbook feature totaled $230.7 million, reflecting our depositors’ preference for traditional banking services. 
 Borrowings. We may obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York by pledging as security our capital stock at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and certain of our mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. Such advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. To the extent such borrowings have different terms to repricing than our deposits, they can change our interest rate risk profile. At December 31, 2017 and 2016 we had $16.4 million and $3.0 million, respectively, outstanding of Federal Home Loan Bank of New York advances. We had $20.0 million outstanding in unsecured borrowings with a correspondent bank at December 31, 2017.

Regulation and Supervision
 General 
 As a federally-chartered stock savings association, Ponce Bank is subject to examination, supervision and regulation, primarily by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and, secondarily, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) as the insurer of deposits. The federal system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which the Bank is engaging and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund. 
 Ponce Bank is regulated to a lesser extent by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the “Federal Reserve Board,” which governs the reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters. In addition, the Bank is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System.  The Bank’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers is also regulated, to a great extent, by federal law and, to a lesser extent, state law, including in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of loan documents. 
 As savings and loan holding companies, PDL Community Bancorp and Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company, are subject to examination and supervision by, and are required to file certain reports with, the Federal Reserve Board. PDL Community Bancorp is subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws. 
 Set forth below are certain material regulatory requirements that are applicable to Ponce Bank and PDL Community Bancorp. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Ponce Bank and PDL Community Bancorp. Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by Congress or the applicable regulatory agencies, could have a material adverse impact on PDL Community Bancorp, Ponce Bank and their operations. 
 23


Dodd-Frank Act 
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act“), have made significant changes to the regulatory structure for depository institutions and their holding companies. However, the Dodd-Frank Act’s changes go well beyond that and affect the lending, investments and other operations of all depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to set minimum capital levels for both bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries, and the components of Tier 1 capital for holding companies were restricted to capital instruments that were then currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. Subsequent regulations issued by the Federal Reserve Board generally exempted from these requirements bank and savings and loan holding companies of less than $1 billion of consolidated assets. The legislation also established a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect before its passage and directed the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, such as Ponce Bank, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets continue to be examined for compliance by their applicable bank regulators. The legislation also weakened the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations, and gave state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act has broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The legislation also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per separately insured depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2008. The Dodd-Frank Act increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments. The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded. Further, the legislation requires that originators of securitized loans retain a percentage of the risk for transferred loans, directs the Federal Reserve Board to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees and contains a number of reforms related to mortgage origination. 
 Many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act involve delayed effective dates and/or require implementing regulations. The implementation of the legislation is an ongoing process and the impact on operations cannot yet fully be assessed. The Dodd-Frank Act has resulted in an increased regulatory burden and compliance, operating and interest expenses for most financial institutions, including Ponce Bank and PDL Community Bancorp. In February 2017, the President of the United States issued an executive order stating that a policy of his administration would be to make regulations efficient, effective, and appropriately tailored. The executive order directed certain regulatory agencies to review and identify laws and regulations that inhibit federal regulation of the U.S. financial system in a manner inconsistent with the policies stated in the executive order. Any changes in laws or regulation as a result of this review could result in a repeal, amendment to or delayed implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act. On March 13, 2018, the U.S. Senate passed S.2155, a bipartisan regulatory reform bill.  Among other provisions, the bill would increase the threshold to qualify for the Federal Reserve Board’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from $1.0 billion to $3.0 billion and also provide for charter flexibility for federally-chartered savings banks and associations to adopt the powers of a national bank.  This bill must still make its way through the U.S. House of Representatives and no assurance can be given that these provisions will ultimately be enacted into law. 
 
Federal Bank Regulations
 Business Activities. A federal savings association derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners’ Loan Act, as amended, and applicable federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, Ponce Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets, subject to applicable limits. The Bank may also establish, subject to specified investment limits, service corporation subsidiaries that may engage in certain activities not otherwise permissible for Ponce Bank, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage. 
 24


Examinations and Assessments.  Ponce Bank is primarily supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  Ponce Bank is required to file reports with and is subject to periodic examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  Ponce Bank is required to pay assessments to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to fund the agency’s operations. PDL Community Bancorp is required to file reports with and is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve Board. It is also required to pay assessments to the Federal Reserve Board to fund the agency’s operations. 
 Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions, including federal savings associations, to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
 The capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively. The regulations also establish a minimum required leverage ratio of at least 4% Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. In 2015, Ponce De Leon Federal Bank, the predecessor of Ponce Bank, made a one-time, permanent election to opt-out regarding the treatment of AOCI. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, an institution’s assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests), are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risk deemed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0.0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50.0% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one-to-four family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100.0% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150.0% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0.0% to 600.0% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. 
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement began phasing in starting January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 
 25

At December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, Ponce Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable requirements.

Loans-to-One Borrower. Generally, a federal savings association may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15.0% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10.0% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if secured by “readily marketable collateral,” which generally includes certain financial instruments (but not real estate). As of December 31, 2017, Ponce Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations. 
 
Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties. 
 Prompt Corrective Action Regulations. Under the federal Prompt Corrective Action statute, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions under its jurisdiction, the severity of which depends upon the institution’s level of capital. An institution that has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% is considered to be “undercapitalized.” A savings institution that has total risk-based capital of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0% or a leverage ratio that is less than 3.0% is considered to be “significantly undercapitalized.” A savings institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2.0% is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized.” 
 Generally, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a federal savings association that becomes “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency within 45 days of the date that a federal savings association is deemed to have received notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Any holding company of a federal savings association that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee performance under the plan in an amount of up to the lesser of 5.0% of the savings association’s assets at the time it was deemed to be undercapitalized by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or the amount necessary to restore the savings association to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency notifies the savings association that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. Institutions that are undercapitalized become subject to certain mandatory measures such as restrictions on capital distributions and asset growth. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized federal savings associations, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. 
 26

At December 31, 2017, Ponce Bank met the criteria for being considered “well capitalized,” which means that its total risk-based capital ratio exceeded 10.0%, its Tier 1 risk-based ratio exceeded 8.0%, its common equity Tier 1 ratio exceeded 6.5% and its leverage ratio exceeded 5.0%. 
 Qualified Thrift Lender Test. As a federal savings association, Ponce Bank must satisfy the qualified thrift lender, or “QTL,” test. Under the QTL test, Ponce Bank must maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including mortgage-backed securities) in at least nine months of every 12-month period. “Portfolio assets” generally means total assets of a savings association, less the sum of specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and the value of property used in the conduct of the savings association’s business. 
 Alternatively, the Bank may satisfy the QTL test by qualifying as a “domestic building and loan association” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. 
 A savings association that fails the qualified thrift lender test must operate under specified restrictions set forth in the Home Owners’ Loan Act. The Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance with the QTL test subject to agency enforcement action for a violation of law. At December 31, 2017, Ponce Bank satisfied the QTL test. 
 Capital Distributions. Federal regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings association, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the savings association’s capital account. A federal savings association must file an application with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for approval of a capital distribution if: 

• | the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings association’s net income for that year to date plus the savings association’s retained net income for the preceding two years;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the savings association would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or regulatory condition; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the savings association is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings association that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as Ponce Bank, must file a notice with the Federal Reserve Board at least 30 days before its board of directors declares a dividend. 
 An application or notice related to a capital distribution may be disapproved if: 
  
• | the federal savings association would be undercapitalized following the distribution;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution shall not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement. A federal savings association also may not make a capital distribution that would reduce its regulatory capital below the amount required for the liquidation account established in connection with its conversion to stock form. 
 Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All federal savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. In connection with its examination of a federal savings association, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to assess the federal savings association’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. A savings association’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications, such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. 
 27

The Community Reinvestment Act requires all institutions insured by the FDIC to publicly disclose their rating.  Ponce De Leon Federal Bank, the predecessor to Ponce Bank, received a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination. 
 Transactions with Related Parties. A federal savings association’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as Ponce Bank. PDL Community Bancorp is an affiliate of Ponce Bank because of its control of the Bank. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a savings association from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. 
 The Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10.0% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders: 
  
• | be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Ponce Bank’s capital.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved. 
 
Enforcement. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings associations and has authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including directors, officers, stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on a federal savings association. Formal enforcement action by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1.0 million per day. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or recommend to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings association. If such action is not taken, the FDIC has authority to take the action under specified circumstances. 
 Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC insured financial institutions such as Ponce Bank. Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts. 
 The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. Under the FDIC’s previous risk-based assessment system, insured institutions were assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s rate depended upon the category to which it was assigned, and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations. Institutions deemed less risky paid lower FDIC assessments. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution’s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The FDIC has set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. 
 Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC adopted changes that eliminated the risk categories. Assessments for most institutions are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure within three years. In conjunction with the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio achieving 1.5%, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was reduced for most banks and savings associations anywhere from 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points. 
 28

In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the annualized FICO assessment was equal to 0.54 basis points of total assets less tangible capital. 
 The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future. 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance. 
 
OTHER REGULATIONS
 
Federal Reserve System
 
Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). The regulations generally require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: for that portion of transaction accounts aggregating $115.1 million or less (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) the reserve requirement is 3.0% and the amounts greater than $115.1 million require a 10.0% reserve (which may be adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board between 8.0% and 14.0%). The first $15.5 million of otherwise reservable balances (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the reserve requirements.  Ponce Bank is in compliance with these requirements.  
Federal Home Loan Bank System
 
Ponce Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. As of December 31, 2017, Ponce Bank was in compliance with this requirement. Ponce Bank may utilize advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York as a supply of investable funds.
Other Regulations
 
Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Ponce Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Ponce Bank’s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:

• | Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Truth in Savings Act; and
--+--------------------------

 29

 
• | Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The operations of Ponce Bank will be subject to the:
  
• | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The USA PATRIOT Act, which requires savings associations to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money laundering compliance programs, and due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirement that also apply to financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Foreign Assets Control regulations; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to “opt out” of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Holding Company Regulations
 
General. PDL Community Bancorp and Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company are non-diversified savings and loan holding companies within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. As such, PDL Community Bancorp and Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company are registered with the Federal Reserve Board and are subject to the regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements applicable to savings and loan holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over PDL Community Bancorp, Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company and its non-savings association subsidiaries, if any. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution.
Permissible Activities. Under present law, the business activities of PDL Community Bancorp and Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company are generally limited to those activities permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, provided certain conditions are met, and financial holding company status is elected, or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. A multiple savings and loan holding company is generally limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to regulatory approval, and certain additional activities authorized by federal regulations. PDL Community Bancorp and Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company did not elect financial holding company status.
 
Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including PDL Community Bancorp and Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5.0% of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company, without prior Federal Reserve Board approval. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board considers factors such as the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund, the convenience and needs of the community, and competitive factors.
 
30

The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions:
  
• | the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisition.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Capital. Savings and loan holding companies have historically not been subjected to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to establish minimum consolidated capital requirements that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. However, pursuant to legislation passed in December 2014, the Federal Reserve Board extended to savings and loan holding companies the applicability of the “Small Bank Holding Company” exception to its consolidated capital requirements and increased the threshold for the exception from $500 million of assets to $1.0 billion, effective May 15, 2015. As a result, savings and loan holding companies with less than $1.0 billion in consolidated assets are generally not subject to the capital requirements unless otherwise advised by the Federal Reserve Board.
Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board has issued regulations requiring that all savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions.
Dividends and Stock Repurchases. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall supervisory financial condition. Separate regulatory guidance provides for prior consultation with Federal Reserve Bank staff concerning dividends in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a savings and loan holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary savings association becomes undercapitalized. The regulatory guidance also states that a savings and loan holding company should inform Federal Reserve Bank supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the savings and loan holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, at the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of PDL Community Bancorp to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
 
Waivers of Dividends by Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company. PDL Community Bancorp may pay dividends on its common stock to public stockholders. If it does, it is also required to pay dividends to Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company, unless Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company elects to waive the receipt of dividends. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company must receive the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may waive the receipt of any dividends from PDL Community Bancorp. The Federal Reserve Board has issued an interim final rule providing that it will not object to dividend waivers under certain circumstances, including circumstances where the waiver is not detrimental to the safe and sound operation of the savings association and a majority of the mutual holding company’s members have approved the waiver of dividends by the mutual holding company within the previous twelve months. In addition, for a “non-grandfathered” mutual holding company such as Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company, each officer or director of PDL Community Bancorp and Ponce Bank, and any tax-qualified stock benefit plan or non-tax-qualified stock benefit plan in which such individual participates that holds any shares of stock to which the waiver would apply, must waive the right to receive any such dividend declared. In addition, any dividends waived by Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company must be considered in determining an appropriate exchange ratio in the event of a conversion of the mutual holding company to stock form.
 
31

Acquisition. Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of a savings and loan holding company. Under certain circumstances, a change of control may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock, unless the Federal Reserve Board has found that the acquisition will not result in control of the company. A change in control definitively occurs upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board generally has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition.
 Federal Securities Laws
 
PDL Community Bancorp’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. PDL Community Bancorp is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Emerging Growth Company Status
 The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), which was enacted in April 2012, has made numerous changes to the federal securities laws to facilitate access to capital markets. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.0 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an “emerging growth company.” PDL Community Bancorp qualifies as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. 
 An “emerging growth company” may choose not to hold stockholder votes to approve annual executive compensation (more frequently referred to as “say-on-pay” votes) or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as “say-on-golden parachute” votes). An emerging growth company also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting, and can provide scaled disclosure regarding executive compensation. PDL Community Bancorp will also not be subject to the auditor attestation requirement or additional executive compensation disclosure so long as it remains a “smaller reporting company” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally less than $75 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates). Finally, an emerging growth company may elect to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company, but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. PDL Community Bancorp has elected to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company. 
 A company loses emerging growth company status on the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year of the company during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the company pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933; (iii) the date on which such company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which such company is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally, at least $700 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates). 
 
Taxation
 Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company, PDL Community Bancorp and Ponce Bank are subject to federal and state income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal and state taxation is intended only to summarize material income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company, PDL Community Bancorp, and Ponce Bank. 
 Our federal and state tax returns have not been audited for the past five years. 
 32

Federal Taxation
 Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, Ponce Bank currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal income tax returns. PDL Community Bancorp and Ponce Bank file a consolidated federal income tax return. The Small Business Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for income taxes on bad debt reserves by savings institutions. For taxable years beginning after 1995, the Bank has been subject to the same bad debt reserve rules as commercial banks. It currently utilizes the specific charge-off method under Section 582(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
 Net Operating Loss Carryovers. Generally, a financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. At December 31, 2017, Ponce Bank had no federal net operating loss carryforwards. Starting in 2018, due to Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), net operating losses incurred after 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but can only offset no more than 80% of taxable income.
State Taxation
 Ponce Bank will be treated as a financial institution under New York and New Jersey state income tax law. The states of New York and New Jersey subject financial institutions to all state and local taxes in the same manner and to the same extent as other business corporations in New York and New Jersey. Additionally, depository financial institutions are subject to local business license taxes and a special occupation tax. 
 Consolidated Group Return. With tax years beginning after January 1, 2015, New York State and New York City require unitary combined reporting for all entities engaged in a unitary business that meet certain ownership requirements. All applicable entities meet the ownership requirements in the Bank filing group and a combined return is appropriately filed. Furthermore, New Jersey is not a unitary business state. Affiliated corporations that file a consolidated federal income tax return must file separate income tax returns unless they have prior approval or have been requested to file a consolidated return by the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Revenue. 
 Net Operating Loss Carryovers. The state and city of New York allow for a three-year carryback period and carryforward period of twenty years on net operating losses generated on or after tax year 2015. For tax years prior to 2015, no carryback period is allowed.  Ponce De Leon Federal Bank, the predecessor of Ponce Bank, has pre-2015 carryforwards of $1.9 million for New York State purposes and $1.8 million for New York City purposes. Furthermore, there are post-2015 carryforwards available of $21.3 million for New York State purposes and $12.3 million for New York City purposes. Finally, for New Jersey purposes, losses may only be carried forward 20 years, with no allowable carryback period. At December 31, 2017, Ponce Bank had no New Jersey net operating loss carryforwards.
