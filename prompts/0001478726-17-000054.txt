ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

General Overview
Charter Financial Corporation (the “Company”) is a savings and loan holding company that was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland in April 2013 to serve as the holding company for CharterBank (the “Bank”). The Bank is a federally-chartered savings bank that was originally founded in 1954 as a federally-chartered mutual savings and loan association. As of September 30, 2017, our total assets were approximately $1.6 billion, total loans receivable were approximately $1.1 billion and our deposits were approximately $1.3 billion. We have total stockholders’ equity of $214.2 million.
On April 8, 2013, the Company completed its conversion and reorganization pursuant to which it converted from the mutual holding company form of organization to the stock holding company form of organization. The Company sold 14.3 million shares of common stock for gross offering proceeds of $142.9 million in the offering. Following the conversion and reorganization, the Bank became 100% owned by the Company, which became 100% owned by public shareholders. This conversion process included raising capital that increased capital to 25.13% of assets, or tangible capital to 24.78% of tangible assets, a non-GAAP measure (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information). As is typical with overcapitalized converted thrifts, the company's stock traded based on book value. With additional capital leverage and resulting improved earnings in fiscal 2017 the Company is now trading primarily on earnings.
 The Company's stockholder value strategy focuses on creating earnings and stockholder value through increasing capital leverage, operating leverage, and expanding into more dynamic markets. In recent years, through acquisitions and strategic de novo branching, the Company has expanded further into the Atlanta Metropolitan Statistical Area ("MSA"). This growth was the result of the following:

• | Acquired all assets and assumed all liabilities of Resurgens Bancorp ("Resurgens"), the parent company of Resurgens Bank, a full-service commercial bank headquartered in Tucker, Georgia, as part of a purchase agreement in September 2017;


• | Acquired all assets and assumed all liabilities of CBS Financial Corporation ("CBS"), the parent company of Community Bank of the South, a full-service commercial bank headquartered in Smyrna, Georgia, as part of a purchase agreement in April 2016;


• | Completed a lift out of a seasoned relationship team in the attractive Buckhead community of Atlanta in October 2015 to operate a new branch that opened in February 2017;


• | Acquired certain assets and assumed all deposits of The First National Bank of Florida (“FNB”), a full-service commercial bank headquartered in Milton, Florida, as a part of a loss-sharing agreement with the FDIC in September 2011;


• | Acquired certain assets and assumed all deposits of McIntosh Commercial Bank (“MCB”), a full-service commercial bank headquartered in Carrollton, Georgia, as a part of a loss-sharing agreement with the FDIC in March 2010;


• | Acquired certain assets and assumed all deposits of Neighborhood Community Bank (“NCB”), a full-service commercial bank headquartered in Newnan, Georgia, as a part of a loss-sharing agreement with the FDIC in June 2009;

• | Opened branch in Norcross, Georgia and staffed with lift out of the area's foremost construction and commercial real estate lenders;


• | Opened de novo branches in LaGrange, Georgia in March 2007 and May 2005;


• | Acquired EBA Bancshares and its subsidiary, Eagle Bank of Alabama, in February 2003.

We have made significant progress by bringing our total capital to total assets ratio to 13.06%, while our tangible capital to tangible assets ratio, a non-GAAP measure, decreased to 10.72%. We also improved our return on average equity to 6.89% and our return on average tangible equity, a non-GAAP measure (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information) to 8.18% since the stock conversion.

The Bank’s principal business consists of attracting retail deposits, focusing on transaction accounts, from the general public. We then invest those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, in commercial real estate loans, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, construction loans and investment securities and, to a lesser extent, commercial business loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and other consumer loans. We offer a variety of community banking services to our customers, including online banking and bill payment services, mobile banking, online cash management, safe deposit box rentals, debit card and ATM card services and the availability of a network of ATMs. We operate 22 branch offices in Metro Atlanta, the I-85 corridor 
2

south to Auburn, Alabama, and the Florida Gulf Coast. The Bank's executive offices are located at 1233 O.G. Skinner Dr., West Point, Georgia 31833. Its telephone number at that address is (706) 645-1391.
Market Area
We conduct operations primarily in three metropolitan areas, along with our legacy market in Troup County, Georgia and Chambers County, Alabama. We currently have 11 branches in the Atlanta MSA, three branches in the Auburn-Opelika, Alabama MSA, and three branches in the Pensacola, Florida MSA, along with five branches in our legacy market. FDIC-assisted acquisitions have complemented the corporate expansion we have achieved in recent years both through de novo branching and acquisitions. Our expansion into the Atlanta market has been a key component of implementing our strategic plan, as all 11 branches in the Atlanta MSA have been added in the last 10 years either through acquisitions or lift outs of lending and customer relationship personnel. We also added the Pensacola MSA through acquisitions. As indicated in the population growth map below, all but one of our branches are in counties projected to experience strong population growth over the next five years.
In the Atlanta MSA, we have locations in Carroll, Cobb, Coweta, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett Counties. As of September 30, 2017, the unemployment rate in the MSA was at 4.0%, below the national and statewide levels. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, population in the MSA grew 28.1% between 2000 and 2010. As of 2015, median household income in the MSA was approximately $57,000, above both the national and state levels.
In the Auburn-Opelika MSA, we conduct business in Lee County in Alabama. As of September 30, 2017, the unemployment rate in the MSA was at 2.9%, below both the statewide and national levels. According to the 2010 Census, population in the MSA grew 21.9% between 2000 and 2010. Median household income in the MSA was approximately $45,000 as of 2015, above the statewide but below national levels.
In the Pensacola MSA, we conduct business in Escambia and Santa Rosa Counties in Florida. As of September 30, 2017, the unemployment rate in the MSA was at 3.3%, below the statewide and national levels. According to the 2010 Census, population in the MSA grew 8.9% between 2000 and 2010. As of 2015, median household income in the MSA was approximately $50,000, below the national level but above the state level.
In our legacy market, we conduct business in Troup County, Georgia and Chambers County, Alabama. As of September 30, 2017, the unemployment rate in the area was at 3.8%, below nationwide and state levels. According to the 2010 Census, population in the area grew 6.2% between 2000 and 2010. As of 2015, median household income in the area was approximately $39,000, below nationwide and state levels.

Our acquisitions of CBS and Resurgens have added to our Atlanta market presence, which in management’s view is a key area for potential growth of the Company. The Atlanta market area comprises the eighth-largest economy in the country and 17th-largest in the world. Key components of the market area’s economy include corporate operations, as the area has the third-largest concentration of Fortune 500 companies in the United States. Other key factors in the area’s economy include media and film entertainment, logistics and transportation, and information technology. The market area was disproportionately impacted by the 2008 financial crisis in unemployment rate, declining real income levels and a depressed housing market. The outlook for the Atlanta market is for above-average growth.
In the Auburn-Opelika MSA, the economy is heavily dependent on higher education, retail, industry and textiles. Auburn was ranked the sixth-best performing city for economic growth in the United States by the Milken Institute in 2016. This market area is forecasted for modest growth over the next five years.
The economy of the Florida Panhandle is primarily dependent upon tourism and hospitality, farming, forestry, paper mills, import/export shipping, shipbuilding, and commercial fishing. Over the next five years, our Florida markets are projected to experience moderate growth in terms of total population and number of households, and Pensacola has been ranked in the top quintile of United States metro areas in population growth. The outlook for our Florida Panhandle market is affected by the heavy influences of military bases and tourism.
Our legacy market's economy was previously heavily dependent on the textile industry, but has shifted to an automotive employment base because of the Kia plant, which opened 10 years ago and which estimates show created more than 12,000 jobs. The area is also influenced by higher education with LaGrange College and Point University, which moved to West Point in 2012. Our legacy market is projected to see modest growth over the next five years.
Competition
We face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. Metro Atlanta, the I-85 corridor south to Auburn, Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle have a high concentration of financial institutions, many of which are branches of large money center, super-regional, and regional banks that have resulted from the consolidation of the banking industry in Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. Many of these competitors have greater resources than we do and may offer services that we do not provide.
Our competition for loans comes from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, credit card banks, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms. Our most direct competition for deposits historically has come from commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, and mutual funds. We face additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds and other corporate and government securities funds as well as from brokerage firms, insurance companies and non-traditional financial institutions, including non-depository financial services providers.
Metro Atlanta Expansion
On September 1, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Resurgens Bancorp and its subsidiary, Resurgens Bank, for cash consideration of $25.8 million. The purchase of Resurgens continued the Company's strategy of leveraging its capital to expand in the Atlanta metropolitan area. Resurgens operated two branches in DeKalb County. We acquired $177.5 million of assets, including $128.8 million of net loans receivable, and assumed $151.7 million of liabilities, including $138.0 million of deposits. See Note 2: Business Combinations for more information regarding the acquisition.
On April 15, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of CBS Financial Corporation and its subsidiary, Community Bank of the South, for cash consideration of $55.9 million. The purchase of CBS expanded the Company's presence in Metro Atlanta with four branches in the attractive Cobb County market. As part of the purchase, we acquired $401.9 million of assets, including $300.8 million of net loans receivable, and assumed $345.9 million of liabilities, including $333.7 million of deposits. See Note 2: Business Combinations for more information regarding the acquisition.

As shown in graphs above the Company had no Atlanta MSA deposits in 2007 and now has 53% of its deposits in the MSA. The Company has the 8th largest deposit market share of community banks in the Atlanta MSA.
FDIC-Assisted Acquisitions
On June 26, 2009, the Bank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with the FDIC to acquire $202.8 million of assets and assume $195.3 million of liabilities of NCB, a full-service commercial bank headquartered in Newnan, Georgia. Subsequently, on March 26, 2010, the Bank entered into an acquisition agreement with the FDIC to acquire $322.6 million of assets and assume $306.2 million of liabilities of MCB, a full-service commercial bank headquartered in Carrollton, Georgia. The retention of NCB's four full-service branches (one of which was closed in 2014) and one of MCB's full-service branches expanded our market presence in west-central Georgia within the I-85 corridor region. Both the NCB and MCB acquisition agreements with the FDIC included loss-sharing agreements pursuant to which the FDIC assumed between 80% and 95% of losses and shared between 80% and 95% of loss recoveries on acquired loans and other real estate owned (“OREO”).
On September 9, 2011, the Bank entered into an acquisition agreement with the FDIC to acquire $251.8 million of assets and assume $247.5 million of liabilities of FNB, a full-service commercial bank headquartered in Milton, Florida. The retention of three of FNB’s full-service branches expanded our market presence to the Florida Panhandle. The purchase and assumption agreement with the FDIC included loss-sharing agreements pursuant to which the FDIC assumed 80% of losses and shared 80% of loss recoveries on acquired loans and other real estate owned.
The three FDIC-assisted acquisitions between 2009 and 2011 extended our retail branch footprint as part of our efforts to increase our retail deposits and reduce our reliance on brokered deposits and borrowings as a significant source of funds. We refer to each of the three financial institutions we acquired in conjunction with FDIC loss share agreements collectively as the “Acquired Banks - FDIC” and we refer to the indemnification assets and other receivables associated with the FDIC loss share agreements related to the Acquired Banks - FDIC as the “FDIC receivable.” Additionally, we refer to loans subject to loss share agreements with the FDIC in periods prior to the termination of all agreements with the FDIC in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, as “covered loans” and loans that were not subject to loss share agreements with the FDIC as “non-covered loans.” For more information regarding the Bank's FDIC-assisted acquisitions and subsequent loss share resolution, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — FDIC Loss-Share Resolution”.
Lending Activities
We offer a broad range of loan products with a variety of rates and terms. Our lending operations consist of the following major segments: commercial real estate lending; single-family residential mortgage lending for retention in our portfolio; 
5

construction lending; commercial business loans; and residential mortgage lending for resale in the secondary mortgage market. To a lesser extent, we also originate consumer loans. Our lending activities are consistent with our community bank orientation.
We have pursued loan diversification with the objective of lowering credit concentration risk, enhancing yields and earnings, and improving the interest rate sensitivity of our assets. Historically, we have focused our lending activities on residential and commercial mortgage loans as well as consumer loans, primarily to local customers.
Commercial Real Estate Loans. Commercial real estate lending is an integral part of our operating strategy and we intend to continue to take advantage of opportunities to originate commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans typically have higher yields, shorter durations and larger loan balances compared to residential mortgage loans. Commercial real estate lending also has provided us with another means of broadening our range of customer relationships. As of September 30, 2017, commercial real estate loan balances totaled $697.1 million, or 60.0% of our total loan portfolio.
Commercial real estate loans are generally made to borrowers in the southeastern United States and are secured by properties in these states. Commercial real estate loans are generally made for up to 80% of the value of the underlying real estate. Our commercial real estate loans are typically secured by offices, hotels, strip shopping centers, warehouses/distribution facilities, land, multi-family properties, or convenience stores located principally in Georgia, Alabama and Florida.
Repayment of commercial real estate loans often depends on the successful operations and income stream of the borrowers, and commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate loans. Our commercial real estate loans generally have higher interest rates and shorter maturities than our residential mortgage loans. We offer commercial real estate loans, generally at adjustable rates. Our most common commercial real estate loan is fixed for five years and then adjustable tied to the prime rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal.
Our underwriting criteria for commercial real estate loans include maximum loan-to-value ratios, debt coverage ratios, secondary sources of repayment, guarantor requirements and quality of cash flow. As part of our loan approval and underwriting of commercial real estate loans, we undertake a cash flow analysis, and we generally require a debt-service coverage ratio of at least 1.15 times. Our capacity to expand this portfolio may be tempered by lack of demand from qualified borrowers and intense competition for good loans.
Risks associated with commercial real estate loans are similar to that of other loans, while repayment is often dependent on the successful operation and cash flows of the owner's business. Commercial real estate loans are also subject to changes in the value of the underlying collateral or decreases in the occupancy rate of non-owner occupied real estate.
Residential Mortgage Loans. We originate first and second mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties within Georgia, Florida and Alabama. We currently originate mortgages in all of our markets, but utilize centralized underwriting at our corporate office. As of September 30, 2017, residential mortgage loans totaled $232.0 million, or 20.0% of total loans.
We originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Fixed-rate, 15 and 30 year, conforming loans are generally originated for resale into the secondary market on a servicing-released basis. It is our intent to originate these 15 year fixed-rate loans for resale into the secondary market. We generally retain in our portfolio loans that are non-conforming due to property exceptions and loans that have adjustable rates. We sell loans to Fannie Mae and retain the servicing associated with these loans. As of September 30, 2017, approximately 36.4% of our one- to four-family loan portfolio consisted of fixed-rate mortgage loans and 63.6% consisted of either adjustable-rate mortgage loans (“ARMs”) or hybrid loans with fixed interest rates for the first one, three, five or seven years of the loan, and adjustable rates thereafter. After the initial term, the interest rate on ARMs generally adjusts on an annual basis at a fixed spread over the monthly average yield on United States Treasury securities, the prime interest rate as listed in The Wall Street Journal, or LIBOR. The interest rate adjustments are generally subject to a maximum increase of 2% per adjustment period and 6% over the life of the loan.
While we offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans with terms of up to 30 years, to limit interest rate risk, as well as to provide liquidity, the Bank sells a majority of its 15, 20 and 30 year fixed-rate mortgage originations into the secondary market. Moreover, to reduce the potential volatility of our net interest income, we funded our fixed-rate mortgage loan portfolio with a combination of long-term fixed rate liabilities and non-maturity core deposits with similar assumptive duration profiles.
The Bank originates one- to four-family residential loans with loan-to-values of up to 80%. We will also originate loans with loan-to-values in excess of 80% with private mortgage insurance. A substantial portion of our one- to four-family residential mortgage loans are secured by properties in Georgia, Alabama and Florida.
We offer home equity lines of credit as a complement to our one- to four-family residential mortgage lending. We believe that offering home equity credit lines helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities. Home equity credit lines have adjustable rates and are 
6

secured by a first or second mortgage on owner-occupied one- to four-family residences located primarily in Georgia, Alabama and Florida. Home equity credit lines enable customers to borrow at rates tied to the prime rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal. The underwriting standards applicable to home equity credit lines are similar to those for one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, except for slightly more stringent credit-to-income and credit score requirements. Home equity loans are generally limited to 90% of the value of the underlying property unless the loan is covered by private mortgage insurance. At September 30, 2017, we had $46.7 million of home equity lines of credit and second mortgage loans. We had $35.7 million of unfunded home equity line of credit commitments at September 30, 2017.
We consider “subprime” loans to be loans originated to borrowers having credit scores below 660 at the time of origination. As of September 30, 2017, the Company had total one- to four-family residential subprime loans of $13.8 million. We do not, and have not, originated “low documentation” or “no documentation” loans, “option ARM” loans, or other loans with special or unusual payment arrangements.
We modify residential mortgage loans when it is mutually beneficial to us and the borrower, and on terms that are appropriate to the circumstances. We have no legacy loans in government modification programs.
Residential mortgage loans are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in the value of real estate. Increases in interest rates, fluctuations in the value of real estate or other factors arising after origination could negatively affect a borrower's cash flow, creditworthiness and ability to repay the loan.
Construction Loans. Consistent with our community bank strategy, construction lending has been an integral part of our overall lending strategy. Construction loans represent an important segment of the loan portfolio, totaling $88.8 million, or 7.6% of loans at September 30, 2017.
We make loans primarily for the construction of one- to four-family residences but also for multi-family and nonresidential real estate projects on a select basis. We offer construction loans to pre-approved local builders including loans on both speculative (unsold) and pre-sold properties. The number of speculative loans that we will extend to a builder at one time depends upon the financial strength and credit history of the builder. Our construction loan program is expected to remain a modest portion of our loan portfolio. We generally limit the number of outstanding loans on unsold homes under construction to within a specific area and/or to a specific borrower.
Construction lending generally carries a higher degree of risk than long-term financing of existing properties because repayment depends on the completion of the project and generally on the subsequent leasing and/or sale of the property. Specific risks include cost overruns, mismanaged construction, inferior or improper construction techniques, economic changes or downturns during construction, a downturn in the real estate market, rising interest rates which may prevent sale of the property and the failure to lease or sell completed projects in a timely manner.
Commercial Loans and Consumer Loans. To a much lesser extent, we also originate non-mortgage loans, including commercial business and consumer loans. At September 30, 2017, commercial loans totaled $103.7 million, or 8.9% of total loans, and consumer and other loans totaled $39.9 million, or 3.4% of loans. 
Our commercial business loans are generally limited to terms of ten years or less. We typically attempt to collateralize these loans with a lien on commercial real estate or with a lien on business assets and equipment. We also generally require the personal guarantee of the business owner. Commercial business loans are generally considered to have more risk than residential mortgage loans or commercial real estate loans because the collateral may be in the form of intangible assets and/or readily depreciable inventory. Commercial business loans may also involve relatively large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers, with the repayment of such loans typically dependent on the successful operation and income stream of the borrower or guarantors. Such risks can be significantly affected by economic conditions. In addition, commercial business lending generally requires substantially greater supervision efforts by our management compared to residential mortgage or commercial real estate lending.
We have a portfolio of SBA loans, a majority of which were purchased in the acquisition of Resurgens. These loans are primarily commercial related, with a portion of each loan guaranteed by the SBA or with other credit enhancements provided by the government.
Our consumer loans are loans on deposits, automobile loans, and various other installment loans, as well as manufactured housing loans purchased from a national lender, most of which are outside our traditional markets. Consumer loans tend to have a higher credit risk than residential mortgage loans because they may be secured by rapidly depreciable assets, or may be unsecured. Our consumer lending generally follows accepted industry standards for non-subprime lending, including certain minimum credit scores and debt to income ratios.

Loan Origination and Approval Procedures and Authority. The following describes our current lending procedures for residential mortgage loans and home equity loans and lines of credit. Upon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective borrower, we order a credit report and verify other information. If necessary, we obtain additional financial or credit related information. We require an appraisal for all residential mortgage loans, except for home equity loans or lines where a valuation may be used to determine the loan-to-value ratio. Appraisals are performed by licensed or certified third-party appraisal firms and are reviewed by our lending department. We require title insurance or a title opinion on all mortgage loans.
We require borrowers to obtain hazard insurance and we also require borrowers to obtain flood insurance prior to closing if the underlying property is in a flood zone. For properties with a private sewage disposal system, we also require evidence of compliance with applicable laws on residential mortgage loans. Further, we generally require borrowers on one- to four-family residential mortgage loans to advance funds on a monthly basis together with each payment of principal and interest to a mortgage escrow account from which we make disbursements for items such as real estate taxes, hazard insurance, flood insurance, and private mortgage insurance premiums, if required.
Commercial loans are approved through the Bank's Management Loan Committee process. The Management Loan Committee consists of the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief Financial Officer and certain other senior lending and credit officers. Commercial loan relationships of $2.0 million or less may be approved outside the Committee process by senior officers who have commercial loan authority. Commercial loan relationships greater than $2.0 million are approved by the Management Loan Committee.
Loan Originations, Participations, Purchases and Sales. Most of our loan originations are generated by our loan personnel operating at our banking office locations and corporate headquarters. All loans we originate are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures. While we originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, our ability to generate each type of loan depends upon relative borrower demand and the pricing levels as set in the local marketplace by competing banks, thrifts, credit unions, and mortgage banking companies. Our volume of real estate loan originations is influenced significantly by market interest rates, and, accordingly, the volume of our real estate loan originations can vary from period to period.
Consistent with our interest rate risk strategy, in the low interest rate environment that has existed in recent years, we have sold almost all fixed-rate, 15- and 30-year conforming one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in the primary and secondary market while retaining commercial real estate loans and non-conforming one- to four-family residential mortgage loans for retention in our portfolio. We sold $100.3 million of loans in fiscal 2017.
Occasionally, we have purchased loan participations in commercial loans in which we are not the lead lender that are secured by real estate or other assets. With regard to all loan participations, we follow our customary loan underwriting and approval policies, and although we may be only approving a portion of the loan, we underwrite the loan request as if we had originated the loan to ensure cash flow and collateral are sufficient. We had $31.5 million of purchased loan participations and $508,000 of sold participations at September 30, 2017. All of our loan participations were performing in accordance with their terms at September 30, 2017. During fiscal 2017, we purchased no new loan participations.
Investments
The Board of Directors reviews and approves our investment policy. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as authorized by the Board, implement this policy based on the established guidelines within the written investment policy, and other established guidelines, including those set periodically by the Asset-Liability Management Committee.
The primary goal of our investment policy is to invest funds in assets with varying maturities that will result in the best possible yield while maintaining the safety of the principal invested and assisting in managing our interest rate risk. We also seek to use our strong capital position to maximize our net income by investing in higher yielding mortgage-related securities funded by borrowings. We also consider our investment portfolio as a source of liquidity.
The broad objectives of our investment portfolio management are to:

• | minimize the risk of loss of principal or interest;


• | generate favorable returns without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk;


• | manage the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities;


• | meet daily, cyclical and long term liquidity requirements while complying with our established policies and regulatory liquidity requirements;


• | provide a stream of cash flow;


• | diversify assets and address maturity or interest repricing imbalances; and


• | provide collateral for pledging requirements.

8

In determining our investment strategies, we consider our interest rate sensitivity, yield, credit risk factors, maturity and amortization schedules, asset prepayment risks, collateral value and other characteristics of the securities to be held.
Sources of Funds
Deposits are the major source of balance sheet funding for lending and other investment purposes. Additional significant sources of funds include liquidity, repayment of loans, loan sales, maturing investments, and borrowings. We believe that our standing as a sound and secure financial institution and our emphasis on the convenience of our customers will continue to contribute to our ability to attract and retain deposits. We offer extended hours at the majority of our branches and alternative banking delivery systems that allow customers to pay bills, transfer funds and monitor account balances at any time. We also offer competitive rates as well as a competitive selection of deposit products, including checking, money market, regular savings and term certificate accounts. In addition, we offer a bank rewarded product that offers a higher rate on deposit balances up to $15,000 if certain conditions are met. These conditions include receiving electronic statements, having at least one monthly ACH transaction per month and having 20 or more debit card transactions per month. For accounts that do not meet these conditions in any given month, the rate paid on the balances is reduced.
We also rely on advertising and long-standing relationships to maintain and develop depositor relationships, while competitive rates are also paid to attract and retain deposits. Furthermore, the NCB, MCB, FNB, CBS and Resurgens acquisitions continue to enhance customer convenience by broadening the markets currently served by the Bank.
We continually evaluate opportunities to enhance deposit growth. Potential avenues of growth include de novo branching and branch or whole bank acquisitions. Additionally, to the extent additional funds are needed, we may employ available collateral to increase borrowings, which are expected to consist primarily of Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Based on asset limitations we have $380.4 million available at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta at September 30, 2017. Based on available collateral pledged we are limited to $54.0 million at September 30, 2017 with additional lendable collateral in the amount of $86.9 million that was available to be pledged. We have a source of emergency liquidity with the Federal Reserve, and at September 30, 2017 we had collateral pledged that provided access to approximately $74.3 million of discount window borrowings.
Employees
As of September 30, 2017, we had 351 full-time employees and 9 part-time employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Management believes that we have a good working relationship with our employees.
Subsidiary Activities
The Company has no direct or indirect operating subsidiaries other than the Bank.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
General
The Company and the Bank are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation that affect virtually all aspects of our operations. This supervision and regulation is designed primarily to protect depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”), administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the banking system as a whole, and generally is not intended for the protection of stockholders. The following summarizes certain of the more important statutory and regulatory provisions applicable to us.
9

The Company is a savings and loan holding company that is required to file certain reports with, is subject to examination by, and otherwise must comply with the rules and regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve Board” or “FRB”). The Company is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws.
The Bank is a federal savings bank or federal savings association, examined and supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and subject to examination by the FDIC. Under this system of federal regulation, the Bank is periodically examined to ensure that it satisfies applicable standards with respect to capital adequacy, assets, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market interest rates. Following completion of its examination, the OCC critiques the Bank’s operations and assigns its rating (known as an institution’s CAMELS rating). The OCC prepares reports for the consideration of the Bank's board of directors on operating deficiencies should any arise. Under federal law, an institution may not disclose its CAMELS rating to the public. The Bank must also comply with consumer protection regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Bank also is regulated to a lesser extent by the FRB, governing reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters. The Bank’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers is also regulated to a great extent by federal law and, to a much lesser extent, state law, especially in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of the Bank’s loan documents and certain consumer protection matters.
Certain of the regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Bank and the Company are described below. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Bank and the Company and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations. Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by the OCC, FRB, the FDIC, the CFPB, or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the Company, the Bank and their operations.
Dodd-Frank Act
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affected the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated our former primary federal regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and required the Bank to be regulated by the OCC (the primary federal regulator for national banks). The Dodd-Frank Act also authorized the FRB to supervise and regulate all savings and loan holding companies, such as the Company.
The Dodd-Frank Act required the FRB to set minimum capital levels for both bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries, and the components of Tier 1 capital for holding companies were restricted to capital instruments that were then currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. The legislation also established a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect upon passage, and directed the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives.
The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with substantial power to enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions such as the Bank, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets such as the Bank will continue to be examined by their applicable federal bank regulators. The legislation also weakened the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings banks, and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws.
The legislation broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a depository institution instead of aggregate deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments. The legislation also directed the federal banking regulators to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded. The Dodd-Frank Act provided for originators of certain securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for transferred loans, directed the FRB to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees and contained a number of reforms related to mortgage origination. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized, for the first time, the payment of interest on commercial checking accounts.
Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have delayed effective dates and the legislation required various federal agencies to promulgate numerous and extensive implementing regulations. Although the complete impact of these regulations cannot be 
10

completely determined at this time, the legislation and implementing regulations have and may continue to increase our operating and compliance costs.
Basel III Capital Rules
In July 2013, our primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve, and the Bank’s primary federal regulator, the OCC, published final rules (“Basel III Capital Rules”) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The Basel III Capital Rules implement the Basel Committee's December 2010 framework known as “Basel III” for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Capital Rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to savings and loan holding companies and depository institutions, including the Company and the Bank. The Basel III Capital Rules define the components of regulatory capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions' regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Capital Rules also revised risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions' regulatory capital ratios with a more risk-sensitive approach. The Basel III Capital Rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies' rules. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015 (subject to phase-in periods as discussed below).
The Basel III Capital Rules, among other things, (i) introduce a new capital measure called “Common Equity Tier 1” (CET1), (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consist of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments from capital as compared to existing regulations. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, for most banking organizations the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and the most common form of Tier 2 capital is subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan losses, in each case, subject to the Basel III Capital Rules’ specific requirements.
Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the initial minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015 are as follows:

• | 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets.


• | 6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets.


• | 8.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets.


• | 4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the “leverage ratio”).

The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1.
The Basel III Capital Rules also introduce a new “capital conservation buffer”, composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules will require the Company and the Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets (as compared to a current minimum leverage ratio of 3% for banking organizations that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the appropriate federal regulatory authority's risk-adjusted measure for market risk).
Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items (except gains and losses on cash flow hedges where the hedged item is not recognized on a banking organization’s balance sheet at fair value) are not excluded; however, certain banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. The Company and the Bank have made this election.
The Basel III Capital Rules also preclude counting certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, as Tier 1 capital of bank or savings and loan holding companies. However for bank or savings and loan holding companies that had assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009 which includes the Company, trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 can be treated as Additional Tier 1 capital to the extent that they do not exceed 25% of Tier 1 capital after applying all capital deductions and adjustments.
11

Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a three-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter until fully phased-in at January 1, 2018). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and be phased in over a three-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019).
The Basel III Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings. These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 day past due or otherwise on nonaccrual status; a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable; a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital; and increased risk-weights (from 0% to up to 600%) for equity exposures.
At September 30, 2017, the Company's and the Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable requirements.
Federal Banking Regulation
Business Activities. A federal savings bank derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners’ Loan Act, as amended, and federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, the Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets, subject to applicable limits. The Bank may also establish subsidiaries that may engage in certain activities not otherwise permissible for the Bank, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage.
Loans-to-One Borrower. Generally, a federal savings bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of September 30, 2017, the Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations.
Qualified Thrift Lender Test. As a federal savings bank, the Bank must satisfy the qualified thrift lender, or “QTL”, test. Under the QTL test, the Bank must maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including mortgage-backed securities) in at least nine months of the most recent 12-month period. “Portfolio assets” generally means total assets of a savings institution, less the sum of specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and the value of property used in the conduct of the savings association’s business.
The Bank also may satisfy the QTL test by qualifying as a “domestic building and loan association” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. A savings association that fails the qualified thrift lender test must operate under specified restrictions, including with regard to the payment of dividends. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, non-compliance with the QTL test may subject the Bank to agency enforcement action for a violation of law. At September 30, 2017, the Bank satisfied the QTL test.
Capital Distributions. Federal regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings bank, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the capital account of a savings association. A federal savings bank must file an application with the OCC for approval of a capital distribution if:

• | the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings association’s net income for that year to date plus the savings association’s retained net income for the preceding two years;


• | the savings association would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution;


• | the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or condition imposed by a regulator; or


• | the savings association is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings.

Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings association that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company must still file a notice with the FRB at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution.
The OCC and the FRB have established similar criteria for approving an application or a notice and may disapprove a notice or application if:

• | the savings association would be undercapitalized following the distribution;


• | the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or


• | the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.

In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution may not make any capital distribution, if the institution would be undercapitalized after the distribution. A federal savings bank also may not make a capital 
12

distribution that would reduce its regulatory capital below the amount required for the liquidation account established in connection with its conversion to stock form. In addition, beginning in 2016, the Bank’s ability to pay dividends is limited if the Bank does not have the capital conservation buffer required by the new capital rules, which may limit the ability of the Company to pay dividends to its stockholders. See “-Basel III Capital Rules.”
Liquidity. A federal savings bank is required to maintain a sufficient amount of liquid assets to ensure its safe and sound operation.
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All federal savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related federal regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In connection with its examination of a federal savings bank, the OCC is required to assess the federal savings association’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. A savings association’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the OCC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.
The Community Reinvestment Act requires all institutions insured by the FDIC to publicly disclose their rating. The Bank received a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination.
Transactions with Related Parties. A federal savings bank’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by FRB regulations and by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is a company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as the Bank. The Company is an affiliate of the Bank. In general, loan transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative and collateral requirements. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a savings association from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. Savings associations are required to maintain detailed records of all transactions with affiliates.
The Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the FRB. Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders:

• | subject to certain exceptions for loan programs made available to all employees, be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features, and


• | not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank’s capital.

Enforcement. The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings institutions and has the authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including shareholders, and attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action by the OCC may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order, to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1 million per day. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or to recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings institution. If action is not taken by the OCC, the FDIC has authority to take action under specified circumstances.
Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. The federal banking agencies adopted Interagency Guidelines Prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement the safety and soundness standards required under federal law. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal 
13

banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties.
Prompt Corrective Action Regulations. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, the OCC is required and authorized to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings associations. For this purpose, a savings association is placed in one of the following five categories based on the savings association’s capital:

• | Well Capitalized - having (1) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10 percent or greater, (2) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent or greater, (3) a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5 percent or greater, (4) a leverage capital ratio of 5 percent or greater and (5) not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.


• | Adequately Capitalized - having (1) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent or more, (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6 percent or more, (3) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5 percent or more, and (4) a leverage ratio of 4 percent or more.


• | Undercapitalized - having (1) a total capital ratio of less than 8 percent, (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 6 percent, (3) a CET1 capital ratio of less than 4.5 percent, or (4) a leverage ratio of less than 4 percent.


• | Significantly Undercapitalized - having (1) a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6 percent (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 4 percent, (3) a CET1 ratio of less than 3 percent or (4) a leverage capital ratio of less than 3 percent.


• | Critically Undercapitalized - having a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2 percent.

Generally, the OCC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings association that is “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date a savings association receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” The criteria for an acceptable capital restoration plan include, among other things, the establishment of the methodology and assumptions for attaining adequately capitalized status on an annual basis, procedures for ensuring compliance with restrictions imposed by applicable federal regulations, the identification of the types and levels of activities the savings association will engage in while the capital restoration plan is in effect, and assurances that the capital restoration plan will not appreciably increase the current risk profile of the savings association. Any holding company for a savings association required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of an amount equal to 5% of the savings association’s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the OCC, or the amount necessary to restore the savings association to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the OCC notifies the savings association that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters, and the OCC has the authority to require payment and collect payment under the guarantee. Failure by a holding company to provide the required guarantee will result in certain operating restrictions on the savings association, such as restrictions on the ability to declare and pay dividends, pay executive compensation and management fees, and increase assets or expand operations. The OCC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized associations, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.
At September 30, 2017, the Bank met the criteria for being considered “well-capitalized.”
Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions such as the Bank. Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts. The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund.
Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. Due to the changes put into effect on July 1, 2016, these rates for institutions with assets less than $10.0 billion, such as the Bank, have rates established based upon CAMELS ratings and certain financial ratios, subject to certain adjustments. As of July 1, 2016, minimum and maximum assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) for institutions the size of the Bank currently range from 1.5 to 30 basis points of each institution’s total assets less tangible capital. The FDIC’s current system represents a change, required by the Dodd-Frank Act, from its prior practice of basing the assessment on an institution’s aggregate deposits.
The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits, and the FDIC must achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are required to fund the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act also eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, and instead gives the FDIC the discretion to determine the maximum fund ratio. The FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long-term fund ratio of 2%.
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order 
14

or condition imposed by the FDIC. The Bank does not believe that it is taking or is subject to any action, condition or violation that could lead to termination of its deposit insurance.
All FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay a pro rata portion of the interest due on obligations issued by the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. For the quarter ended September 30, 2017, the annualized Financing Corporation assessment was equal to 0.36 basis points of total assets less tangible capital. Assessments related to the FICO bond obligations were not subject to the December 30, 2009 prepayment.
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, the Bank paid $72,098 related to the FICO bonds and was assessed $399,994 pertaining to deposit insurance assessments.
Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. Federal savings banks are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. As a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank.
As of September 30, 2017, outstanding borrowings from the FHLB of Atlanta were $60.0 million and the Bank was in compliance with the stock investment requirement.
Other Regulations
Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. In addition, the Bank’s operations are subject to federal laws and regulations applicable to credit transactions, financial privacy, money laundering and electronic fund transfers.
Holding Company Regulation
General. The Company is a non-diversified savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. As such, the Company is registered with the FRB and subject to FRB regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements. In addition, the FRB has enforcement authority over the Company and, in some instances, the Bank. Among other things, this authority permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the Bank.
Permissible Activities. Under present law, the business activities of the Company are not limited so long as the Bank continues to meet the QTL test. However, the Company's activities are otherwise generally limited to those activities permissible for financial holding companies, bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. The Dodd-Frank Act specifies that a savings and loan holding company may only engage in financial holding company activities if it meets the qualitative criteria necessary for a bank holding company to engage in such activities, makes an election to be treated as a financial holding company and conducts the activities in accordance with the requirements that would apply to a financial holding company’s conduct of such activity. As of September 30, 2017, the Company has not elected to be a financial holding company.
Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including the Company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or holding company thereof, without prior written approval of the FRB. It also prohibits the acquisition or retention of, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a non-subsidiary company engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking or financial in nature, or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not federally insured. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the FRB must consider the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.
The FRB is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions:

(i) | the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and

15


(ii) | the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisition.

The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.
Capital. Savings and loan holding companies historically have not been subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act, however, requires the Federal Reserve Board to establish for all depository institution holding companies minimum consolidated capital requirements that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. See “-Basel III Capital Rules.”
Dividends and Repurchases. The FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies that it has made applicable to savings and loan holding companies as well. In general, the guidance provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The guidance provides for prior regulatory review of capital distributions in certain circumstances, such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The guidance also provides for regulatory consultation prior to a holding company redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction as of the end of a quarter in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The regulatory agencies must issue regulations requiring that all bank and savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. We have existing policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and we review and document such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations.
Change in Control Regulations. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company such as the Company unless the FRB has been given 60 days’ prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the institution’s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquiror has the power, directly or indirectly, to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a savings and loan holding company’s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable determination of control under the regulations under certain circumstances, including where the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
In addition, federal regulations provide that no company may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company without the prior approval of the FRB. Any company that acquires such control becomes a “savings and loan holding company” subject to registration, examination and regulation by the FRB.
Federal Securities Laws
The Company's common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, the Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
TAXATION
Federal Taxation 
General. First Charter, MHC and Charter Federal were, and the Bank and the Company are, subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal 
16

taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Charter Federal, the Company or the Bank.
Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, Charter Federal reported its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and used a tax year ending September 30 for filing its federal and state income tax returns. Similarly, for federal income tax purposes, the Company reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending September 30 for filing its federal and state income tax returns.
Bad Debt Reserves. Historically, the Bank has been subject to special provisions in the tax law regarding allowable tax bad debt deductions and related reserves. Tax law changes were enacted in 1996, pursuant to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the “1996 Act”), that eliminated the use of the percentage of taxable income method for tax years after 1995 and required recapture into taxable income over a six year period all bad debt reserves accumulated after 1987. The Bank has recaptured its reserves accumulated after 1987.
Currently, the Charter Financial consolidated group uses the specific charge off method to account for bad debt deductions for income tax purposes.
Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to 1996, bad debt reserves created prior to 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if the Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests or made certain distributions. Tax law changes in 1996 eliminated thrift-related recapture rules. However, under current law, pre-1988 tax bad debt reserves remain subject to recapture if the Bank makes certain non-dividend distributions, repurchases any of its common stock, pays dividends in excess of earnings and profits, or fails to qualify as a “bank” for tax purposes.
At September 30, 2017, the total federal pre-base year bad debt reserve of the Bank was approximately $2.1 million. 
Alternative Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, less any available exemption. The alternative minimum tax is imposed to the extent it exceeds the regular income tax. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of alternative taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. Charter Federal's consolidated group has not been subject to the alternative minimum tax and has no such amounts available as credits for carryover.
Net Operating Loss Carryovers. Generally, a financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years.
Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction. Charter Federal excluded from its federal taxable income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a wholly-owned subsidiary by filing consolidated tax returns. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 80% when the corporation receiving the dividend owns at least 20% of the stock of the distributing corporation. The dividends-received deduction is 70% when the corporation receiving the dividend owns less than 20% of the distributing corporation.
Audit of Tax Returns. An audit by the Internal Revenue Service of First Charter, MHC, Charter Federal and the Bank's federal income taxes for 2009 to 2011 was completed in fiscal 2013. Tax years 2014, 2015 and 2016 are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. Tax years 2014 through 2016 are subject to examination by state taxing authorities in Georgia, Alabama and Florida.
State Taxation
The Bank currently files Georgia, Florida and Alabama income tax returns. Generally, the income of financial institutions in Georgia, Alabama and Florida, which is calculated based on federal taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, is subject to Georgia, Alabama and Florida tax, respectively.
The Company is required to file a Georgia income tax return and will generally be subject to a state income tax rate that is the same tax rate as the tax rate imposed on financial institutions in Georgia.
As a Maryland business corporation, the Company is required to file an annual report with and pay franchise taxes to the state of Maryland.
