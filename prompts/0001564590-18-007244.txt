Item 1.  Business 
General Development of Business
 Esterline, a Delaware corporation formed in 1967, is a leading specialized manufacturing company principally serving aerospace and defense customers.  We design, manufacture and market highly engineered products and systems for application within the industries we serve.
 Our current business and strategic plan focuses on continued development of our products principally for aerospace and defense markets in three key technology segments:  Avionics & Controls, Sensors & Systems, and Advanced Materials.  Our products are often mission critical, which have been designed into particular military and commercial platforms, and in certain cases can only be replaced by products of other manufacturers following a formal certification process.  We are concentrating our efforts to expand our capabilities in these markets, anticipate the global needs of our customers and respond to such needs with comprehensive solutions.  These efforts focus on continuous research and new product development, acquisitions, and strategic realignment of operations to expand our capabilities as a more comprehensive supplier to our customers across our entire product offering.  Such expansion included the January 2015 acquisition of the defense, aerospace and training display business, Esterline Advanced Displays (EAD), of Belgium-based Barco N.V. (Barco).  This acquisition is described in more detail in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Continuing Operations contained in Item 7 of this report.
 In December 2013 we announced the acceleration of our plans to consolidate certain facilities and create cost efficiencies through shared services in sales, general and administrative and support functions, which were completed in fiscal 2016.  We incurred costs of $8.7 million in fiscal 2016 and $14.6 million in the recast twelve-month period of fiscal 2015 associated with these activities.  The costs include severance, relocation of facilities, and losses from the write off of certain property, plant and equipment.
 In March 2014 we entered into a Consent Agreement with the U.S. Department of State’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance (DTCC) to resolve alleged International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) civil violations.  Among other things, the Consent Agreement required us to pay a $20 million penalty, of which $10 million was suspended and eligible for offset credit.  In fiscal 2016 the DTCC approved costs we incurred to implement compliance measures to fully offset the $10 million suspended payment.  On September 5, 2017, the DTCC notified us that it is closing the Consent Agreement.  The closing of the Consent Agreement was based on our certifications that all aspects of the Consent Agreement have been implemented and that our trade compliance program is adequate to identify, prevent, detect, correct, and report violations of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and ITAR, as well as the DTCC’s assessment that we have fulfilled the terms of the Consent Agreement.
 In fiscal 2014 our Board of Directors approved the plan to sell certain non-core business units including Eclipse Electronic Systems, Inc. (Eclipse), a manufacturer of embedded communication intercept receivers for signal intelligence applications; Wallop Defence Systems, Ltd. (Wallop), a manufacturer of flare countermeasure devices; a small distribution business; Pacific Aerospace and Electronics Inc. (PA&E), a manufacturer of hermetically sealed electrical connectors; and a small manufacturing business.  As of September 29, 2017, we have sold these business units except for the land and building at Eclipse and Wallop, which are currently held for sale.  These businesses are reported as discontinued operations.
 We recorded a loss from discontinued operations of $7.3 million, $15.3 million, and $40.3 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 In fiscal 2017 we evaluated the on-going performance challenges at our elastomer business based in Brea, California, known as the Kirkhill business, resulting in the decision to explore all strategic options associated with the business.  The historic performance volatility of this business was a consideration in this decision.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the results of operations of the Kirkhill business declined by $10 million from the prior-year period, resulting in a loss of $5 million reflecting lower sales volumes of certain defense products under a new long-term contract which replaced a higher priced product.  In March 2018 the Board of Directors approved the sale of the Kirkhill business and on March 15, 2018, we sold the assets and certain liabilities of 
 5

this business to TransDigm, Inc. for $50 million before a working capital adjustment to be determined when the closing balance sheet is finalized.  The loss on sale is estimated to range between $5 million and $7 million.
 Our products have a long history in the aerospace and defense industry and are found on most military and commercial aircraft, helicopters, and land-based systems.  For example, our products are used on the majority of active and in-production U.S. military aircraft and on every Boeing commercial aircraft platform manufactured in the past 75 years.  In addition, our products are supplied to Airbus, many of the major regional and business jet manufacturers, and the major aircraft engine manufacturers.  We work closely with OEMs on new, highly engineered products with the objective of such products becoming designed into our customers’ platforms; this integration often results in sole-source positions for OEM production and aftermarket business.  We broadly categorize our commercial and military aerospace aftermarket sales as retrofit, repair services, and spare parts. Spare parts alone made up approximately 9% of total sales in fiscal 2017.  Retrofit and repair services, which represent 3% of total sales in fiscal 2017, carry higher margins than OEM sales but lower margins than spare parts sales.  In many cases, our aftermarket sales span the entire life of an aircraft. 
 We differentiate ourselves through our engineering and manufacturing capabilities and our reputation for safety, quality, on-time delivery, reliability, and innovation – all embodied in the Esterline Operating System, our way of approaching business that helps ensure all employees are focused on continuous improvement, teamwork, a safe work environment and compliance.  Safety of our operations is a critical factor in our business, and accordingly, we incorporate applicable regulatory guidance in the design of our facilities and train our employees using a behavior-based approach that focuses on safety-designed work habits and on-going safety audits.  Our industries are highly regulated, and compliance with applicable regulations, including export control and anti-bribery regulations, is an important focus in our business.  We have a global code of business conduct and ethics, and we provide corporate-wide training and maintain local ethics advisors and export control specialists in our business units to support our compliance efforts.  In fiscal 2017 we continued our significant efforts to build and strengthen our trade compliance program, driven in large part by the requirements of the Consent Agreement discussed above.
 Our sales are diversified across three broad markets:  defense, commercial aerospace and general industrial.  For fiscal 2017, approximately 30% of our sales were from the defense market, 40% from the commercial aerospace market, and 30% from the general industrial market.

 A summary of product lines contributing sales of 10% or more of total sales for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 is reported in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this report.
 Marketing and Distribution
 We believe that a key to continued success is our ability to meet customer requirements both domestically and internationally.  We have and will continue to improve our world-wide sales and distribution channels in order to provide wider market coverage and to improve the effectiveness of our customers’ supply chain.  For example, our medical device assembly operation in Shanghai, China, serves our global medical customers, our service center in Singapore improves our capabilities in Asia for our temperature sensor customers, and our engineering and marketing offices in Bangalore, India, facilitate marketing opportunities in India.  Other enhancements include combining sales and marketing forces of our operating units where appropriate, cross-training our sales representatives on multiple product lines, and cross-stocking our spares and components.
 In the technical and highly engineered product segments in which we compete, relationship selling is particularly important in targeted marketing segments where customer and supplier design and engineering inputs need to be tightly integrated.  Participation in industry trade shows is an effective method of meeting customers, introducing new products, and exchanging technical specifications.  In addition to technical and industry conferences, our products are supported through direct internal international sales efforts, as well as through manufacturer representatives and selected distributors.  As of September 29, 2017, 364 sales people, 253 representatives, and 315 distributors supported our operations.
 Backlog
 Backlog was $1.3 billion at September 29, 2017, and September 30, 2016.  We estimate that approximately $440 million of backlog is scheduled to be shipped after fiscal 2018.
 Backlog is subject to cancellation until delivered, and therefore, we cannot assure that our backlog will be converted into revenue in any particular period or at all.  Except for the released portion, backlog also does not include fixed-price, multi-year contracts.
Competition
 Our products and services are affected by varying degrees of competition.  We compete with other companies in most markets we serve.  Many of these companies have far greater sales volumes and financial resources than we do.  Some of our competitors are also our customers or suppliers on certain programs.  The principal competitive factors in the commercial markets in which we participate are customer intimacy, product performance, on-time delivery performance, quality, service and price.  Part of product performance requires expenditures in research and development that lead to product improvement.  The market for many of our products may be affected by rapid and significant technological changes and new product introductions.  Our principal competitors include Astronautics, BAE, Bose, Eaton, Elbit, EMS, Essex Industries, GE Aerospace, Honeywell, IAI, L-3, Otto Controls, RAFI, SELEX, Telephonics, Thales, Ultra Electronics, United Technologies Corporation, Universal Avionics Systems Corporation, and Zodiac in our Avionics & Controls segment; Ametek, Amphenol, Eaton, Meggitt, STPI-Deutsch, TE Connectivity, Woodward and Zodiac in our Sensors & Systems segment; and Alloy Surfaces, AMTEC, Chemring, Doncasters, Hi-Temp, J&M, JPR Hutchinson, 
 8

Kmass, Meggitt (including Dunlop Standard Aerospace Group), Rheinmetall, Trelleborg, ULVA, UTC Aerospace Systems, UMPCO, and Woodward Products in our Advanced Materials segment.
 Research and Development
 Our product development and design programs utilize an extensive base of professional engineers, technicians and support personnel, supplemented by outside engineering and consulting firms when needed.  In fiscal 2017 we expended $109.1 million for research, development and engineering, compared with $99.2 million in fiscal 2016 and $98.9 million in the recast twelve-month period of fiscal 2015.  Research and development expense has averaged 5.2% of sales per year for the three years ended September 29, 2017.  We believe continued product development is key to our long-term growth, and consequently, we consistently invest in research and development.  Examples include research and development projects relating to avionics displays, power systems, and controls.  We actively participate in customer-funded research and development programs.
Foreign Operations
 Our foreign operations consist of manufacturing facilities located in Belgium, Canada, China, the Dominican Republic, France, Germany, India, Mexico, Morocco, and the United Kingdom, and include sales and service operations located in Brazil, China, and Singapore.  For further information regarding foreign operations, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this report.
 U.S. Government Contracts and Subcontracts
 As a contractor and subcontractor to the U.S. government (primarily the DoD), we are subject to various laws and regulations that are more restrictive than those applicable to private sector contractors.  Approximately 3% of our sales was made directly to the U.S. government in fiscal 2017.  In addition, we estimate that our subcontracting activities to contractors for the U.S. government accounted for approximately 18% of sales during fiscal 2017.  In total, we estimate that approximately 21% of our sales during the fiscal year were subject to U.S. government contracting regulations.  Such contracts may be subject to termination, reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending, and other factors.
 Historically, our U.S. government contracts and subcontracts have been predominately fixed-price contracts.  Generally, fixed-price contracts offer higher margins than cost-plus contracts in return for accepting the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce anticipated profits or cause us to sustain losses on the contracts.  The accuracy and appropriateness of certain costs and expenses used to substantiate our direct and indirect costs for the U.S. government under both cost-plus and fixed-price contracts are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency, an arm of the DoD.  The contracts and subcontracts to which we are a party are also subject to profit and cost controls and standard provisions for termination at the convenience of the U.S. government.  Upon termination, other than for our default, we will normally be entitled to reimbursement for allowable costs and to an allowance for profit.
 Trade Compliance Regulations
 We are subject to U.S. export laws and regulations, including the ITAR, that generally restrict the export of defense products, technical data, and defense services.  On March 5, 2014, the Company entered into a Consent Agreement with the DTCC to resolve alleged ITAR civil violations.  The Consent Agreement settled the pending ITAR compliance matter with the DTCC previously reported by the Company that resulted from voluntary reports the Company filed with DTCC that disclosed possible technical and administrative violations of the ITAR.  The Consent Agreement had a three-year term and provided for:  (i) a payment of $20 million, $10 million of which was suspended and eligible for offset credit based on verified expenditures for past and future remedial compliance measures; (ii) the appointment of an external Special Compliance Official to oversee compliance with the Consent Agreement and the ITAR; (iii) two external audits of the Company’s ITAR compliance program; and (iv) continued implementation of ongoing compliance measures and additional remedial compliance measures related to automated systems and ITAR compliance policies, procedures, and training.  The $10 million portion of the settlement that was not subject to suspension was paid.  Compliance expense associated with these measures was $7.1 million in fiscal 2017 and $10.4 million in the prior-year period.  In fiscal 2016, the DTCC approved costs we incurred to implement compliance measures to fully offset the $10 million suspended payment.  The Consent Agreement was closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
 Our trade activities are also subject to customs and border control regulations, anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, and regulations that apply to supply chain activities, such as those relating to conflict minerals and the registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals, as well as the defense federal acquisition regulations.  Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in penalties, loss, or suspension of contracts, breach of contract claims, or other consequences, and the costs to maintain compliance with these regulations may be higher than we anticipate.  Any of these consequences could adversely affect our operations or financial condition.

Intellectual Property
 Although we hold a number of patents and licenses, we do not believe that our operations are dependent on our patents and licenses.  We have trademark registrations on our important business names and/or product names filed in key jurisdictions where our businesses operate and sell products.  In general, we rely on technical superiority, continual product improvement, exclusive product features, lean manufacturing and operational excellence, including superior lead-time, on-time delivery performance and quality, and customer relationships to maintain competitive advantage.
Seasonality
 The timing of our revenues is impacted by the purchasing patterns of our customers, and as a result we do not generate revenues evenly throughout the year.  Moreover, our first fiscal quarter, October through December, includes significant holiday vacation periods in both Europe and North America.  This leads to decreased order and shipment activity; consequently, first quarter results are typically weaker than other quarters and not necessarily indicative of our performance in subsequent quarters.  Beginning in fiscal 2016, we changed our fiscal year to the twelve months ended the last Friday in September to better align with the aerospace industry’s business cycle.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Components
 The sources and availability of certain raw materials and components are not as critical as they would be for manufacturers of a single product line, due to our vertical integration and diversification.  However, certain components, supplies and raw materials for our operations are purchased from single sources.  In such instances, we strive to develop alternative sources and design modifications to minimize the effect of business interruptions.
Environmental Matters
 We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances that (i) govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water, as well as handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous waste, and (ii) impose liability for the costs of cleaning up, and certain damages resulting from, sites or past spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances.
 At various times we have been identified as a potentially responsible party pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), and analogous state environmental laws, for the cleanup of contamination resulting from past disposals of hazardous wastes at certain sites to which we, among others, sent wastes in the past.  CERCLA requires potentially responsible persons to pay for cleanup of sites from which there has been a release or threatened release of hazardous substances.  Courts have interpreted CERCLA to impose strict, joint and several liability on all persons liable for cleanup costs.  As a practical matter, however, at sites where there are multiple potentially responsible persons, the costs of cleanup typically are allocated among the parties according to a volumetric or other standard.
 We have accrued liabilities for environmental remediation costs expected to be incurred. Environmental exposures are provided for at the time they are known to exist or are considered probable and estimable.
 Employees
 We had 13,255 employees at September 29, 2017, of which 4,825 were based in the United States, 4,360 in Europe, 1,498 in Mexico, 981 in Canada, 791 in the Middle East and Asia, 635 in Morocco, and 165 in the Dominican Republic.  Approximately 12% of the U.S.-based employees were represented by labor unions.  Our non-U.S. operations are subject to union and national trade union agreements and to local regulations governing employment.
