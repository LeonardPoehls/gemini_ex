STRATEGY
Our strategy is to build on our leading position in a large global market by investing in what matters most to our clients and leveraging our strong financial position to drive sustainable growth and value creation for our shareholders. 
Build on a Leading Market Position to Grow With Our Loyal and Expanding Client Base
The Company’s primary focus is on growth with multinational corporations and other large companies in the communications and media, financial services, technology, healthcare, retail and other vertical markets. Convergys intends to build deeper, more strategic relationships to compete for additional market share, expand business with existing clients and further penetrate under-served verticals through pursuit of new clients. 
Capitalize on Industry Trends by Investing in Quality, Capability and Clients
We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from several trends in the Customer Management industry, including increasing customer contact complexity, demand for full life-cycle services, vendor consolidation and global delivery. To capitalize on these trends, the Company invests in a combination of global quality delivery, comprehensive solutions, and close client engagement.
Increasing Customer Contact Complexity 
As technology becomes more pervasive, customer contact to troubleshoot this technology becomes increasingly complex and difficult to resolve. Convergys invests in its global operating model to attract and retain the right talent that is trained and supported by the right tools to handle these complex customer contacts in a quality manner, at scale, regardless of location. 
Full Lifecycle Services 
Client strategies for customer service change rapidly. Increasingly, clients want business partners that offer a breadth and depth of capabilities and the flexibility to make rapid adjustments to the services they provide to their customers. To meet these changing client needs, Convergys invests in agents, analytics and technology solutions that support the full life-cycle of contact types, including sales, customer service, technical support, customer retention and collections. 
Vendor Consolidation
Increasingly, clients seek to drive efficiencies and a consistent customer experience by concentrating outsourced operations with a smaller number of strategic partners. Convergys invests in account management to ensure close client engagement to better understand unique client needs. We have also invested in a breadth of capabilities and delivery geographies to enable us to win additional share with clients as they seek to consolidate their volume with fewer vendors. 
Global Delivery
Clients demand a seamless customer experience across multiple channels and geographies. Convergys invests in global capacity to provide the right services, including language support, to better serve customers and drive the quality delivery and value our clients demand around the world.
Utilize Financial Strength to Invest in Strategic Growth, Return Capital to Investors
Convergys historically has demonstrated an ability to generate strong operating cash flow, which allows it to both invest in strategic growth and return capital to investors. The Company expects to continue to follow its disciplined capital deployment strategy consisting of selective pursuit of acquisitions, focusing on diversity of clients, capabilities and countries, and return of capital to investors through share repurchases and a quarterly dividend.

CLIENTS
We derive significant revenues from AT&T Inc. (AT&T), our largest client. Revenues from AT&T (including DIRECTV Group, Inc. in all years) were 20.5%, 21.3%, and 23.7% of our consolidated revenues for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. No other client accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for 2016, 2015 or 2014. Volumes with individual clients are often earned under multiple contracts and are subject to variation based on, among other things, general economic conditions, client outsourcing trends and seasonal patterns in our clients’ businesses.

We focus on developing long-term, strategic relationships with large companies in customer-intensive industries. We focus on these types of clients because of the complexity of services required, the anticipated growth of their market segments and their increasing need for more cost-effective customer management services.
OPERATIONS
We operate 149 contact centers averaging approximately 78,000 square feet per center. We have approximately 99,700 production workstations and provide service 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Our workforce is located throughout the world, including the United States, the Philippines, Germany, the United Kingdom, India, Canada, Tunisia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Egypt, France, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Romania, China, Malaysia, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Bulgaria, Hungary, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mauritius, Singapore, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates. Our global operating model seeks to deliver a consistent customer experience regardless of where the service is provided. We establish new contact centers as needed to accommodate anticipated growth in business or in response to a specific customer need. 
Our contact centers can employ a broad range of technology, including digital switching, intelligent call routing and tracking, proprietary workforce management systems, case management tools, proprietary software systems, computer telephony integration, interactive voice response, advanced speech recognition, web-based tools and relational database management systems. Our use of technology enables us to improve our voice, chat, web and e-mail handling and personnel scheduling, thereby increasing our efficiency and enhancing the quality of the services we deliver to our clients and their customers. We are able to respond to changes in client call volumes and manage call volume traffic based on agent availability. Additionally, we can use this technology to collect information concerning the contacts, including number, response time, duration and results of the contact and report the information to the client on a periodic basis for purposes of monitoring quality of service and accuracy of the related billing.
We operate a distributed data processing environment that can integrate call center data servers and databases with two primary data centers in Orlando, Florida and Cincinnati, Ohio, comprising, in total, approximately 90,000 square feet of space. Our technologically advanced data centers provide 24 hours a day, 365 days a year availability (with redundant power and communication feeds and emergency power back-up) and are designed to withstand most natural disasters.
The capacity of our data center and contact center operations, coupled with the scalability of our customer management solutions, enable us to meet the changing needs of large-scale and rapidly growing companies and government entities. By employing the scale and efficiencies of common application platforms, we can provide client-specific enhancements and modifications without incurring many of the costs of a full custom application, which positions us as a value-added provider of customer support products and services.
TECHNOLOGY, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
We will continue to emphasize the design, development and deployment of scalable customer management solutions. Our success depends, in part, on the technology we use in the delivery of services to clients. As a result, we continue to invest in the enhancement and development of advanced contact center technology.

Our intellectual property consists primarily of business methods and software systems. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely primarily on a combination of U.S. and foreign copyright, trade secret and trademark laws; confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties; and contractual protections contained in licenses and other agreements with consultants, suppliers, strategic partners and clients.

We own 119 patents, which protect certain technology and business methods that we use to manage our internal systems and processes effectively and we believe give us competitive advantages in developing innovative technologies to provide customer management services to our clients. Our existing patents were issued between July 1997 and January 2017 and generally have a life of 20 years. Additional applications for U.S. patents currently are pending.

Our name and logo are protected by their historic use and by trademarks and service marks that are registered or pending in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and under the laws of more than 82 foreign countries.
