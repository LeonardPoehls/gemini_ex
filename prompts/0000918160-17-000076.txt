Operations Overview
AK Steel Holding Corporation (“AK Holding”) is a corporation formed under the laws of Delaware in 1993 and is an integrated producer of flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steels and tubular products through its wholly-owned subsidiary, AK Steel Corporation (“AK Steel”). AK Steel is the successor through merger in 1999 to Armco Inc., which was formed in 1900. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to “we,” “us” and “our” refer to AK Holding and its subsidiaries.
We are the only steelmaker in the United States that can produce a combination of flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steels. In addition, we are the only steelmaker in the United States operating both blast furnaces and electric arc furnaces, which provides us operational flexibility and the opportunity to innovate across markets and within our product portfolios. Our primary operations include eight steelmaking and finishing plants, two coke plants and two tube manufacturing plants across six states—Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia—and a tube manufacturing plant in Mexico. These operations produce flat-rolled carbon, specialty stainless and electrical steels that we sell in sheet and strip form, and carbon and stainless steel that we finish into welded steel tubing. We also produce metallurgical coal through our AK Coal Resources, Inc. (“AK Coal”) subsidiary. In addition, we operate trading companies in Mexico and Europe that buy and sell steel and steel products and other materials.
In 2014, we acquired Severstal Dearborn, LLC (“Dearborn”). The assets acquired include the integrated steelmaking assets located in Dearborn, Michigan (“Dearborn Works”), the Mountain State Carbon, LLC (“Mountain State Carbon”) cokemaking facility located in Follansbee, West Virginia, and interests in joint ventures that process flat-rolled steel products.
Customers and Markets
Carbon steels
We sell flat-rolled carbon steel products, consisting of premium-quality coated, cold-rolled, and hot-rolled carbon steel products, primarily to automotive manufacturers and their suppliers, as well as to customers in the infrastructure and manufacturing market. The infrastructure and manufacturing market primarily includes electrical transmission, heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment, and appliances. We also sell carbon steel products to distributors, service centers and converters, who may further process these products before reselling them. Our goal is to carry appropriate inventory levels that will meet our customers’ needs, particularly for the “just-in-time” delivery requirements necessary to service the demanding automotive market. Our strategy is to target markets for our steel products that deliver higher margins, where possible, and reduce amounts sold into the lower margin steel spot markets, which has experienced substantial volatility in pricing over the past several years primarily as a result of the impact of low-priced imports of foreign steel. In late 2015, we temporarily idled the blast furnace and steelmaking operations (the “Hot End”) at our Ashland Works in Kentucky. The Ashland Works Hot End remains temporarily idled due to continuing uncertainty of steel market conditions (including the longer-term outlook for import levels) and our ability to earn an appropriate return on its operations. In 2016, we increased capacity utilization of our carbon steelmaking operations at our Middletown Works in Ohio (“Middletown Works”) and Dearborn Works, and we reduced our production of commodity carbon, electrical and stainless steel products. Also in 2016, we enhanced asset and resource utilization to reduce operating costs and modified production capacity for higher margin carbon, electrical and stainless steel grades at all locations. See Automotive Market and Carbon Steel Spot Market for more information.
Stainless steels
We sell our stainless steel products to manufacturers and their suppliers in the automotive industry, to manufacturers of food handling, chemical processing, pollution control, medical and health equipment, and to distributors and service centers. For stainless steels, as well as carbon steels, we target customers who require the highest quality flat-rolled steel with precise “just-in-time” delivery and technical support. Our enhanced product quality and delivery capabilities, as well as our emphasis on collaborative customer technical support and product planning, are critical factors in our ability to serve these markets. See the Specialty Stainless Steel Market section for more information.
Electrical steels
We sell our electrical steel products in the infrastructure and manufacturing market, primarily to manufacturers of power transmission and distribution transformers, both for new and replacement installation. We also sell electrical steel products to manufacturers of

electrical motors and generators. We target our electrical steel products to customers who desire the highest quality iron-silicon alloys that provide low core loss and high permeability required for more efficient and economical electrical transformers. Our electrical steels are among the most energy efficient in the world. As with customers of our other steel products, we provide our electrical steel customers outstanding technical support and product development assistance. See Electrical Steel Market section for more information.
Markets
For our carbon steel, stainless steel and electrical steel products, we intentionally limit our participation in the commodity portions of those markets, where attributes such as high quality, technical support and innovation are less valued and where selling prices and product margins are generally lower.
Because of our focus on shipments to the automotive industry and our decision to ship fewer tons to the spot market, Ford Motor Company and FCA US LLC accounted for 12% and 11% of our net sales in 2016, and 12% and 11% of our net sales in 2015. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in 2014. The following table presents the percentage of our net sales to each of our primary markets:

Market | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Automotive | 66 | % | | 60 | % | 53 | %
Infrastructure and Manufacturing | 16 | % | | 16 | % | 18 | %
Distributors and Converters | 18 | % | | 24 | % | 29 | %

We sell our carbon steel products principally to customers in the United States. We sell our electrical and stainless steel products both domestically and internationally. Our customer base is geographically diverse and there is no single country outside the United States where our sales are material compared to our total net sales. We do not have any material long-lived assets located outside the United States. The following shows net sales by geographic area and as a percentage of worldwide net sales:

 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 
Geographic Area | Net Sales | | % | | Net Sales | | % | | Net Sales | | %
United States | $ | 5,226.9 | | | 89 | % | | $ | 5,837.2 | | | | % | $ | 5,750.3 | | | %
Foreign countries | 655.6 | | | 11 | % | | 855.7 | | | 13 | % | | 755.4 | | 12 | %
Total | $ | 5,882.5 | | | 100 | % | | $ | 6,692.9 | | | 100 | % | $ | 6,505.7 | | 100 | %

We sold approximately 70% of our flat-rolled steel shipments in 2016 under fixed base price contracts. Some of these contracts have a surcharge mechanism that passes through certain changes in input costs. These contracts are typically for one year and expire at various times throughout the year. We sold the remainder of our shipments in 2016 into the spot market at market prices or under contracts that have pricing typically linked to a steel index that triggers a price adjustment based on the previous monthly or quarterly reference point.
The automotive market is an important element of our business and growth strategy and, therefore, North American light vehicle production has a significant impact on our total sales and shipments. In 2016, North American automotive manufacturers experienced a record year with light vehicle production of approximately 17.8 million units, representing a 2% increase from the prior year. The improvement in the automotive market and our increased share of that market resulted in higher sales and shipments of our steel to the automotive market in 2016. Most automotive manufacturers are currently predicting a slight decline in total North American light vehicle production volumes for 2017 compared to 2016, though this level of production would still be considered robust compared to historical volumes.
In 2016, housing starts in the United States improved approximately 5% over 2015, which generally increased the demand for products from power transmission and distribution transformer manufacturers, to whom we sell electrical steels. To a lesser extent, we also experienced higher demand for stainless and carbon steels from appliance manufacturers, manufacturers of heating and air conditioning equipment and others. We saw improvements in higher value electrical steel pricing and demand during 2016, but this was partly offset by lower prices in and lower shipments to the electrical steel spot markets as a result of a high level of commodity steel imports into the United States. Electrical steel sales and shipments to customers in foreign countries also have been negatively affected by excess global production capacity and what we believe to be preferential trade practices by certain countries that make our products more expensive to sell in those countries.

Raw Materials and Other Inputs
Our steel manufacturing operations require iron ore, coal, coke, chrome, nickel, zinc, carbon steel scrap and stainless steel scrap as primary raw materials. We also use large volumes of natural gas, electricity and industrial gases. In past years we have purchased carbon steel slabs from other steel producers to supplement our production from our own steelmaking facilities, but we did not purchase carbon steel slabs in 2016.
We typically purchase carbon and stainless steel scrap, natural gas, a substantial portion of our electricity and most other raw materials at prevailing market prices, which may fluctuate with market supply and demand. However, we make most of our purchases of iron ore, coke, industrial gases and a portion of our electricity at negotiated prices under annual or multi-year agreements with periodic price adjustments. We purchase substantially all our iron ore from one supplier under multi-year contracts. We typically purchase coal under annual fixed-price agreements. Additionally, we may hedge portions of our energy and raw materials purchases to reduce volatility. During late 2016, we terminated our iron ore pellet offtake agreement with Magnetation LLC (“Magnetation”), which caused our iron ore derivatives to no longer meet the accounting criteria for hedge accounting treatment. As a result, we now account for those derivatives on a mark-to-market basis with immediate recognition of changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts in earnings when the change occurs, instead of when we recognize the underlying cost of iron ore, thus potentially increasing the volatility of our results of operations. This volatility does not affect the ultimate gains or losses on the derivative contracts we will recognize in the financial statements, but only the timing of recognition.
We also attempt to reduce the risk of future supply shortages and price volatility in other ways. If multi-year contracts are available in the marketplace, we may use these contracts to secure enough supply to satisfy our key raw material needs. When multi-year contracts are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we enter into annual contracts or make spot purchases to meet the remainder of our raw materials needs. We also regularly evaluate using alternative sources and substitute materials.
We believe that we have secured, or will be able to secure, adequate supply sources for our raw materials and energy requirements for 2017 and for at least the next three to five years. However, our raw material suppliers may experience production disruptions, which could create shortages of raw materials in 2017 or later.
Research and Innovation
Research and innovation is deeply ingrained in our history and is one of the key focus areas of our company. Differentiating ourselves by providing new, innovative products is a strategic priority, as we believe such differentiation in higher value carbon, stainless and electrical steels to meet challenging applications enables us to maintain and enhance our margins by providing customers with breakthrough solutions. We conduct a broad range of research and development activities aimed at improving existing products and manufacturing processes and developing new products and processes. In recent years, we have increased our focus and spending on new product innovation. In the carbon steel market, we are particularly focused on advanced high-strength steels (“AHSS”) for the automotive market. We produce virtually every grade of AHSS that our customers currently need, but our goal is to develop the next generation of AHSS with even greater formability. In the electrical steel market, our research efforts are aimed at developing the highest-efficiency steels in the world for use in power transmission and distribution transformers. In addition, we are focused on achieving new breakthroughs in electrical motors and generators for use in the next generations of hybrid and electric vehicles. In the stainless steel market, we are developing more high-temperature, corrosion-resistant steels for a variety of applications, including vehicle exhaust systems that can accommodate hotter-burning engines for increased fuel efficiency.
Developing new steel products and steel processes has been our legacy and we have recently reinvigorated our focus on research and innovation. At the end of 2016, we moved into our new Research and Innovation Center in Middletown, Ohio. The facility includes pilot lines and features new operational simulators that replicate critical steel manufacturing operations to allow our researchers, scientists and engineers to continue their leading-edge research, applications engineering, advanced engineering, product development and customer technical services.
Also during 2016, we implemented new process technology to produce both coated and cold-rolled Next-Generation AHSS (NEXMET™ AHSS) on the hot-dip galvanizing line at Dearborn Works. Our goal is to provide NEXMET AHSS trial material to our customers in early 2017 for evaluation and qualification. Looking beyond, we continue to push our innovation efforts toward groundbreaking steel technologies, including advances in Third-Generation AHSS (see Innovation and Product Development in Item 7). We have significantly increased our investment in research and innovation during the past three years from $17.5 in 2014 to $28.3 in 2016 for normal ongoing activities, in addition to our new Research and Innovation Center.

Employees
At December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 8,500 people, of which approximately 6,100 are represented by labor unions. The labor contracts covering these represented employees expire between 2017 and 2019. See the discussion under Labor Agreements in Item 7 for additional information on these agreements.
Competition
We compete with domestic and foreign flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steel and tubular product producers (both integrated steel producers and mini-mill producers) and producers of plastics, aluminum and other materials that may be used as a substitute for flat-rolled steels in manufactured products. Mini-mills generally offer a narrower range of products than integrated steel mills, but have been expanding their product capabilities in recent years. In addition, mini-mills have some competitive cost advantages as a result of their different production processes and lower labor costs associated with what are often non-union workforces. Price, quality, on-time delivery, customer service and product innovation are the primary competitive factors in the steel industry and vary in importance according to the product category and customer requirements.
Steel producers that sell to the automotive market are facing increasing competition from aluminum manufacturers (and, to a lesser extent, other materials) as automotive manufacturers attempt to develop vehicles that will enable them to satisfy more stringent government-imposed fuel efficiency standards. To address automotive manufacturers’ lightweighting needs that the aluminum industry is targeting, we and others in the steel industry continue to develop grades of AHSS that we believe provide similar weight savings, require minimal capital investments by customers, and are stronger, less costly, more sustainable, easier to repair and more environmentally friendly than aluminum.
Domestic steel producers, including us, face significant competition from foreign producers. For many reasons, these foreign producers often are able to sell products in the United States at prices substantially lower than domestic producers. Depending on the country of production, these reasons may include generous government subsidies; lower labor, raw material, energy and regulatory costs; less stringent environmental regulations; less stringent safety requirements; the maintenance of artificially low exchange rates against the U.S. dollar; and preferential trade practices in their home countries. In recent years, the annual level of imports of foreign steel into the United States has increased over historical levels and is affected to varying degrees by the relative level of overcapacity of steel production in those countries, the strength of demand for steel outside the United States and the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against various foreign currencies.
In 2014 and 2015, the combination of overcapacity and slowing domestic demand in countries such as China resulted in imports of low-priced foreign steel into the United States at levels significantly higher than recent historical periods. This caused increased downward pressure on the price of flat-rolled steels in the American marketplace. Imports of finished steel into the United States accounted for approximately 26%, 29% and 28% of domestic steel market consumption in 2016, 2015 and 2014, levels that are higher than the historic norm. During 2016, we successfully concluded the anti-dumping (“AD”) and countervailing duty (“CVD”) cases that we and other major domestic steel producers initiated over a year ago against imports of corrosion-resistant, cold-rolled and hot-rolled carbon steel products from multiple foreign countries. Also during 2016, the International Trade Commission (“ITC”) issued the last of its final determinations that the domestic steel industry has been materially injured by imports of these steel products from the countries named in the petitions. As a result, the final duties determined by the United States Department of Commerce (“Commerce Department”), which in some cases exceed 400% for combined AD and CVD duties, will remain in effect for a minimum of five years. Following those determinations, in September 2016, we and other domestic producers made filings with the Commerce Department asserting that Chinese steel producers are attempting to circumvent the AD and CVD duties against corrosion-resistant and cold-rolled carbon steel by transshipping Chinese steel through Vietnam for minor processing before importing final steel products into the U.S. market. Our filings request that the Commerce Department find that imports of Vietnamese corrosion-resistant and cold-rolled steel that originated in China be subjected to the same AD and CVD duties of shipments of those steel products imported directly from China. The Commerce Department announced the initiation of these investigations in November 2016. See Trade Cases in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
We continue to provide pension and healthcare benefits to a great number of our retirees, resulting in a competitive disadvantage compared to certain other domestic integrated steel companies and mini-mills that do not provide such benefits to any or most of their retirees. However, we have taken a number of actions to reduce pension and healthcare benefits costs, including negotiating progressive labor agreements that have significantly reduced total employment costs at all of our union-represented facilities, transferring all responsibility for healthcare benefits for various groups of retirees to Voluntary Employee Benefits Association trusts, offering voluntary lump-sum settlements to pension plan participants and lowering retiree benefit costs for salaried employees. During 2016, we purchased two non-participating annuity contracts from a highly rated insurance company and transferred to it pension obligations of $210.3 for certain retirees or their beneficiaries receiving pension payments. In total, we transferred the obligations for approximately 10,000 retirees or their beneficiaries to the insurance company in exchange for a similar amount of pension trust assets.

These actions have increased our ability to compete in the highly competitive global steel market over the long term and we continue to seek opportunities to reduce pension and healthcare benefits costs.
