Item 1.  Business
Exterran Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Exterran Corporation,” “our,” “we” or “us”), a Delaware corporation formed in March 2015, is a global systems and process company offering solutions in the oil, gas, water and power markets. We are a market leader in natural gas processing and treatment and compression products and services, providing critical midstream infrastructure solutions to customers throughout the world. Outside the United States of America (“U.S.”), we are a leading provider of full-service natural gas contract compression, and a supplier of aftermarket parts and services. Our manufacturing facilities are located in the U.S., Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.
Spin-off
On November 3, 2015, Archrock, Inc. (named Exterran Holdings, Inc. prior to November 3, 2015) (“Archrock”) completed the spin-off (the “Spin-off”) of its international contract operations, international aftermarket services (the international contract operations and international aftermarket services businesses combined are referred to as the “international services businesses” and include such activities conducted outside of the U.S.) and global fabrication businesses into an independent, publicly traded company named Exterran Corporation. We refer to the global fabrication business previously operated by Archrock as our product sales business. To effect the Spin-off, on November 3, 2015, Archrock distributed, on a pro rata basis, all of our shares of common stock to its stockholders of record as of October 27, 2015 (the “Record Date”). Archrock shareholders received one share of Exterran Corporation common stock for every two shares of Archrock common stock held at the close of business on the Record Date. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement with Archrock and certain of our and Archrock’s respective affiliates, on November 3, 2015, we transferred cash of $532.6 million to Archrock. Our Registration Statement on Form 10, as amended, was declared effective on October 21, 2015. On November 4, 2015, Exterran Corporation common stock began “regular-way” trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol “EXTN.” Following the completion of the Spin-off, we and Archrock became and continue to be independent, publicly traded companies with separate boards of directors and management.
General
We provide our products and services to a global customer base consisting of companies engaged in all aspects of the oil and natural gas industry, including large integrated oil and natural gas companies, national oil and natural gas companies, independent oil and natural gas producers and oil and natural gas processors, gatherers and pipeline operators. We operate in three primary business lines: contract operations, aftermarket services and product sales. The nature and inherent interactions between and among our business lines provide us with opportunities to cross-sell or offer integrated product and service solutions to our customers.
For financial data relating to our reportable business segments or countries that accounted for 10% or more of our revenue in any of the last three fiscal years or 10% or more of our property, plant and equipment, net, as of December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015, see Part II, Item 7 (“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”) and Note 23 to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 (collectively referred to as “Financial Statements,” and individually referred to as “balance sheets,” “statements of operations,” “statements of comprehensive income (loss),” “statements of stockholders’ equity” and “statements of cash flows” herein). We are currently in the process of transitioning into four regional structures to more effectively and efficiently serve our customer needs. We do not anticipate that this will fundamentally change how we deploy capital.

Contract Operations
In our contract operations business, we own and operate natural gas compression equipment and crude oil and natural gas production and processing equipment on behalf of our customers outside of the U.S. We provide comprehensive contract operations services to our customers based on each customer’s needs and operating specifications. Our services include the provision of personnel, equipment, tools, materials and supplies to meet our customers’ natural gas compression or oil and natural gas production and processing service needs. Activities we may perform in meeting our customer’s needs include engineering, designing, sourcing, constructing, installing, operating, servicing, repairing, maintaining and decommissioning equipment owned by us necessary to provide these services.
We generally enter into contracts with our contract operations customers with initial terms ranging between three to five years, and in some cases, in excess of 10 years. In many instances, we are able to renew those contracts prior to the expiration of the initial term and in other instances, we may sell the underlying assets to our customers pursuant to purchase options or negotiated sale. If a contract is not renewed or a customer does not purchase the underlying assets, our equipment is returned to our premises for future redeployment. These contracts may require us to make significant investments in equipment, facilities and related installation costs. These projects may include several compressor units on one site or entire facilities designed to process and treat oil or natural gas to make it suitable for end use. Our commercial contracts generally require customers to pay a monthly service fee even during periods of limited or disrupted oil or natural gas flows, which we believe provide us with relatively stable and predictable cash flows. Additionally, because we typically do not take title to the oil or natural gas we compress, process or treat, and because the natural gas we use as fuel for our equipment is supplied by our customers, we have limited direct exposure to short-term commodity price fluctuations.
Our equipment is maintained in accordance with established maintenance schedules. These maintenance procedures are updated as technology changes and as our operations team develops new techniques and procedures. In addition, because our field technicians provide maintenance on our contract operations equipment, they are familiar with the condition of our equipment and can readily identify potential problems. In our experience, these maintenance procedures maximize equipment life and unit availability, minimize avoidable downtime and lower the overall maintenance expenditures over the equipment life. We believe our contract operations services generally allow our customers to achieve higher production rates than they would achieve with their own operations, resulting in increased revenue for our customers. In addition, outsourcing these services allows our customers flexibility for their compression and production and processing needs while limiting their capital requirements. 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 31% of our revenue and 70% of our gross margin was generated from contract operations. Our contract operations business is capital intensive. As of December 31, 2017, the net book value of property, plant and equipment associated with our contract operations business was $745.9 million.
Aftermarket Services
In our aftermarket services business, we sell parts and components and provide operations, maintenance, overhaul, upgrade, commissioning and reconfiguration services to customers outside of the U.S. who own their own compression, production, processing, treating and related equipment. Our services range from routine maintenance services and parts sales to the full operation and maintenance of customer-owned equipment. 
We generally enter into contracts with our operation and maintenance customers with initial terms ranging between two to four years, and in some cases, in excess of six years. In many instances, we are able to renew those contracts prior to the expiration of the initial term. We believe that we are particularly well qualified to provide these services because of our highly experienced operating personnel and technical and engineering expertise gained through providing similar services as part of our contract operations business. In addition, our aftermarket services business compliments our strategy to provide integrated infrastructure solutions to our customers because it enables us to continue to serve our customers after the sale of any assets or facilities manufactured through our product sales business. We seek to couple our aftermarket services with our product sales business to provide ongoing services to customers who buy equipment from us and also seek to sell those services to customers who have bought equipment from other companies.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 9% of our revenue and 8% of our gross margin was generated from aftermarket services.

Product Sales
In our product sales business, we design, engineer, manufacture, install and sell natural gas compression packages as well as equipment used in the production, treating and processing of crude oil and natural gas primarily to major and independent oil and natural gas producers as well as national oil and natural gas companies in the countries where we operate. We offer a broad range of equipment designed to make crude oil and natural gas suitable for end use. We believe the broad range of products we sell through our global platform enables us to take advantage of the ongoing, worldwide energy infrastructure build-out.
Our products include line heaters, oil and natural gas separators, glycol dehydration units, condensate stabilizers, dew point control plants, water treatment, mechanical refrigeration and cryogenic plants and skid-mounted production packages designed for both onshore and offshore production facilities. We sell standard production and processing equipment, which is used for processing wellhead production from onshore or shallow-water offshore platform production. In addition, we sell custom-engineered, built-to-specification production and processing equipment, including designing facilities comprised of a combination of our products integrated into a solution that meets our customers’ needs. Some of these projects are in remote areas and in developing countries with limited oil and natural gas industry infrastructure. To meet most customers’ rapid response requirements and minimize customer downtime, we maintain an inventory of standard products and longer lead-time components used to manufacture our products to our customers’ specifications. Typically, we expect our production and processing equipment backlog to be produced within a three to 24 month period.
We also design, engineer, manufacture, sell and, in certain cases, install, skid-mounted natural gas compression equipment to meet standard or unique customer specifications. Generally, we assemble compressors sold to third parties according to each customer’s specifications. We purchase components for these compressors from third party suppliers including several major engine and compressor manufacturers in the industry. We also sell pre-engineered compressor units designed to maximize value and fast delivery to our customers. Typically, we expect our compressor equipment backlog to be produced within a three to 12 month period.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 60% of our revenue and 22% of our gross margin was generated from product sales. As of December 31, 2017, our backlog in product sales was $461.0 million, all of which is expected to be recognized as revenue before December 31, 2018. Our product sales backlog consists of unfilled orders based on signed contracts and does not include potential product sales pursuant to letters of intent received from customers. 
Competitive Strengths
We believe we have the following key competitive strengths:

• | Global platform and expansive service and product offerings positioned to capitalize on the global energy infrastructure build-out. Global oil and natural gas infrastructure continues to be built out, which provides us with opportunities for growth. We are well positioned to capitalize on increased opportunities in the U.S. and international markets. We believe our global customer base continues to invest in infrastructure projects based on longer-term fundamentals that are less tied to near-term commodity prices and that our size, geographic scope and broad customer base provide us with a unique advantage in meeting our customers’ needs and will allow us to capture future opportunities. We provide our customers with a broad variety of products and services in approximately 30 countries worldwide, including outsourced compression, production and processing services, natural gas compression, oil and natural gas production and processing equipment, water treatment solutions, installation services and integrated power generation.

• | Complementary businesses enable us to offer customers integrated infrastructure solutions. We aim to provide our customers with a single source to meet their energy infrastructure needs and we believe we have the ability to serve our customers’ changing needs in a variety of ways. For customers that seek to manage their capital spending on energy infrastructure projects, we offer our full operations services through our contract operations business. For customers that prefer to develop and acquire their own infrastructure assets, we are able to sell equipment and facilities for their operations and, following the sale of our equipment, we can also provide commissioning, operations, maintenance, overhaul, upgrade and reconfiguration services through our aftermarket services. Furthermore, we combine our products into an integrated solution that we design, engineer, procure and, in some cases, construct on-site for sale to our customers. Because of the breadth of our products and our ability to deliver those products through our different delivery models, we believe we are able to provide the solution that is most suitable to our customers in the markets in which they operate. We believe this ability to provide our customers with a variety of products and services provides us with more business opportunities, as we are able to adjust the products and services we provide to reflect our customers’ changing needs. 


• | High-quality products and services. We have built a network of high-quality energy infrastructure assets that are strategically deployed across our global platform. Through our history of operating a wide variety of products in many energy-producing markets around the world, we have developed the technical expertise and experience that we believe is required to understand the needs of our customers and to meet those needs through a range of products and services. These products and services include highly customized compression, production and processing solutions as well as standard products based on our expertise, in support of a range of projects, from those requiring quick completion to those that may take several years to fully develop. Additionally, our experience has enabled us to develop efficient systems and processes and a skilled workforce that allow us to provide high-quality services throughout international markets. We seek to continually improve our products and services to enable us to provide our customers with high-quality, comprehensive oil and natural gas infrastructure support worldwide. 


• | Cash flows from our contract operations business are supported by long-term contracts. We provide contract operations services to customers located in approximately 15 countries. Within our contract operations business, we seek to enter into long-term contracts with a diverse collection of customers, including large integrated oil and natural gas companies and national energy companies. These contracts generally involve initial terms ranging from three to five years, and in some cases, in excess of 10 years, and typically require our customers to pay our monthly service fee even during periods of limited or disrupted oil or natural gas flows. Furthermore, our customer base includes several companies that are among the largest and most well-known companies within their respective regions throughout our global platform. 


• | Experienced management team. We have an experienced and skilled management team with a long track record of driving growth through organic expansion and selective acquisitions. The members of our management team have strong relationships in the oil and gas industry and have operated through numerous commodity price cycles throughout our areas of operations. Members of our management team have spent a significant portion of their respective careers at highly regarded energy and manufacturing companies. 


• | Well-balanced capital structure with sufficient liquidity. We intend to maintain a capital structure with an appropriate amount of leverage and the financial flexibility to invest in our operations and pursue attractive growth opportunities that we believe will increase the overall earnings and cash flow generated by our business. As of December 31, 2017, taking into account guarantees through letters of credit, we had undrawn capacity of $640.3 million under our revolving credit facility, of which $585.2 million was available for additional borrowings as a result of a covenant restriction included in our credit agreement. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we had $49.1 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand.

Industry Overview
Natural Gas Compression
Our international compression business is comprised primarily of large horsepower compressors that are typically deployed in facilities comprised of several compressors on one site. A significant portion of this business involves comprehensive projects that require the design, engineering, manufacture, delivery and installation of several compressors on one site coupled with related natural gas treating and processing equipment. We are able to serve our customers’ needs for such projects through our product sales business and with follow-on services from our aftermarket services business, or through the provision of our contract operations services.

Natural gas compression is a mechanical process whereby the pressure of a given volume of natural gas is increased to a desired pressure for transportation from one point to another and is essential to the production and transportation of natural gas. Compression is typically required several times during the natural gas production and transportation cycle, including (i) at the wellhead, (ii) throughout gathering and distribution systems, (iii) into and out of processing and storage facilities and (iv) along pipelines. Natural gas compression can also be used to re-inject associated gas into producing wells to provide enhanced oil recovery.
Production and Processing
Crude oil and natural gas are generally not marketable as produced at the wellhead and must be processed or treated before they can be transported to market. Production and processing equipment is used to separate and treat oil and natural gas as they are produced to achieve a marketable quality of product. Production processing typically involves the separation of oil and natural gas and the removal of contaminants or the separation of marketable liquids from the gas stream prior to transportation. The end result is “pipeline” or “sales” quality oil and natural gas. Further processing or refining is almost always required before oil or natural gas is suitable for use as fuel or feedstock for petrochemical production. Production processing normally takes place in the “upstream” and “midstream” segments, while refining and petrochemical processing is referred to as the “downstream” segment. Wellhead or upstream production and processing equipment include a wide and diverse range of products.
We manufacture and stock standard production equipment based on historical product mix and expected customer purchases following general trends of oil and natural gas production. In addition, we sell custom-engineered, built-to-specification production and processing equipment. We also provide integrated solutions comprised of a combination of our products into a single offering, which typically consists of much larger equipment packages than standard equipment and is generally used in much larger scale production operations. The custom equipment segment is primarily driven by global economic trends, and the specifications for purchased equipment can vary significantly. Technology, engineering capabilities, project management, available manufacturing space and quality control standards are the key drivers in the custom equipment segment.
Outsourcing
Natural gas producers, transporters and processors choose to outsource their operations due to the benefits and flexibility of contract operations. In particular, we believe outsourcing compression, production and processing operations to us offers customers:

• | access to our specialized personnel and technical skills, including engineers and field service and maintenance employees, which we believe generally leads to improved production rates and increased throughput and higher revenues;


• | the ability to increase their profitability by transporting or producing a higher volume of natural gas through decreased equipment downtime and reduced operating, maintenance and equipment costs by allowing us, as the service provider, to efficiently manage their operations; and


• | the flexibility to deploy their capital on projects more directly related to their primary business by reducing their investment in compression, production and processing equipment and related maintenance capital requirements.

Oil and Natural Gas Industry Cyclicality and Volatility
Changes in oil and natural gas exploration and production spending normally result in changes in demand for our products and services. However, we believe our contract operations business is less impacted by commodity prices than certain other energy service products and services because compression, production and processing services are necessary for oil and natural gas to be delivered from the wellhead to end users. Furthermore, our contract operations business is tied primarily to oil and natural gas production and consumption, which are generally less cyclical in nature than exploration activities.
Demand for oil and natural gas is cyclical and subject to fluctuations. This is primarily because the industry is driven by commodity demand and corresponding price movements. When oil and natural gas price increases occur, producers typically increase their capital expenditures, which generally results in greater activity levels and revenues for equipment providers to the oil and gas industry. During periods of lower oil or natural gas prices, producers typically decrease their capital expenditures, which generally results in lower activity levels and revenues for equipment providers to the oil and gas industry.
Seasonal Fluctuations
Our results of operations have not historically reflected material seasonal tendencies and we do not believe that seasonal fluctuations will have a material impact on us in the foreseeable future.

Markets, Customers and Competition
Our global customer base consists primarily of companies engaged in all aspects of the oil and natural gas industry, including large integrated oil and natural gas companies, national energy companies, independent producers and natural gas processors, gatherers and pipeline operators.
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2015, Archrock and its affiliates accounted for approximately 12% and 11% of our total revenue, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (“Petrobras”) accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015. The loss of our business with Petrobras or Archrock, unless offset by additional sales to other customers, or the inability or failure of Petrobras or Archrock to meet its payment obligations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See Note 17 to the Financial Statements for further discussion on transactions with affiliates. 
We currently operate in approximately 30 countries. We have manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Singapore and the United Arab Emirates and offices in the major oil and gas regions around the world.
The businesses in which we operate are highly competitive. Overall, we experience considerable competition from companies that may be able to more quickly adapt to changes within our industry and changes in economic conditions as a whole and to more readily take advantage of available opportunities. We believe we are competitive with respect to price, equipment availability, customer service, flexibility in meeting customer needs, technical expertise, quality and reliability of our compression, production and processing equipment and related services. We face vigorous competition throughout our businesses, with some firms competing with us in multiple businesses. In our product sales business, we have different competitors in the standard and custom-engineered equipment segments. Competitors in the standard equipment segment include several large companies and a large number of small, regional fabricators. Our competition in the custom-engineered segment consists mainly of larger companies with the ability to provide integrated projects and product support after the sale.
We expect to face increased competition as we seek to diversify our customer base and increase utilization of our service offerings.
The separation and distribution agreement from the Spin-off contains certain noncompetition provisions addressing restrictions on our ability to provide compression contract operations and aftermarket services in the U.S. and on Archrock’s ability to provide compression contract operations and aftermarket services outside of the U.S. and product sales to customers worldwide that expire on November 3, 2018, subject to certain exceptions.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
We manufacture natural gas compression and oil and natural gas production and processing equipment to provide contract operations services and to sell to third parties from components which we acquire from a wide range of vendors. These components represent a significant portion of the cost of our compressor and production and processing equipment products. Increases in raw material costs cannot always be offset by increases in our products’ sales prices. While many of our materials and components are available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices, we obtain some of the components, including compressors and engines, used in our products from a limited group of suppliers. We occasionally experience long lead times for components, including compressors and engines, from our suppliers and, therefore, we may at times make purchases in anticipation of future orders.
Environmental and Other Regulations
Government Regulation
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex U.S. federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that could have a material impact on our operations or financial condition. Our operations are regulated under a number of laws governing, among other things, discharges of substances into the air, ground and regulated waters, the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous substances, disclosure of information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations, and occupational health and safety.
8

Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities and cause us to incur significant capital expenditures in our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations. In certain circumstances, laws may impose strict, joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. In addition, it is not uncommon for third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. We currently own or lease, and in the past have owned or leased, a number of properties that have been used in support of our operations for a number of years. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons, hazardous substances, or other regulated wastes may have been disposed of, or released, on or under the properties owned by us, leased by us or other locations where such materials have been taken for disposal by companies sub-contracted by us. In addition, many of these properties have been previously owned or operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or other regulated wastes were not under our control. These properties and the materials released or disposed thereon may be subject to various laws that could require us to remove or remediate historical property contamination, or to perform certain operations to prevent future contamination. We are not currently under any order requiring that we undertake or pay for any cleanup activities. However, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not receive any such order in the future.
The clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in these laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, emission or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 4,500 employees. Many of our employees outside of the U.S. are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We generally consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory.
