Item 1. Business
General
 
Throughout this report, we refer to Aly Energy Services, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, as “we,” “our”, “us,” “Aly Energy” or “the Company.” References to financial results and operations of the Company are limited to continuing operations unless otherwise specified.
 
We provide a variety of oilfield services to owners and operators of oil and gas wells. Generally, these services fall within the category of surface rental equipment or solids control services.
 
On July 17, 2012, Munawar “Micki” Hidayatallah founded Aly Energy with the strategic objective of creating an oilfield services company that serves exploration and production companies from well planning to plug and abandonment. We have grown our business both through organic growth resulting from investment in existing operations and through the strategic acquisition of certain businesses operating in our industry.
 
To date, we have acquired three businesses: 
 
 
· | Austin Chalk Petroleum Services Corp. (“Austin Chalk”) - In October 2012, we acquired Austin Chalk a provider of high performance, explosion-resistant rental equipment used primarily in land-based horizontal drilling. Austin Chalk currently offers a robust inventory of surface rental equipment as well as roustabout services, including the rig-up and rig-down of equipment and the hauling of equipment to and from the customer’s location; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | United Centrifuge LLC and the leased fixed assets associated with that business (collectively “United”) - United, acquired in April 2014, operates within the solids control sector of the oilfield services industry, offering its customers the option of renting centrifuges and auxiliary solids control equipment without personnel or the option of paying for a full-service solids control package which includes operators on-site 24 hours a day. United owns centrifuges which are differentiated from the competition due to the ability to remove the rotating assembly from a centrifuge within 45 minutes while on the rig site thereby minimizing customer down time; and
· | Evolution Guidance Systems Inc. (“Evolution”) - In July 2014, we acquired Evolution which specialized as an operator of Measurement-While-Drilling (“MWD”) downhole tools. Effective October 26, 2016, we abandoned these operations as a part of a restructuring event (see “Note 2 – Recent Developments” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail). 

Business Outlook
 
Our core businesses depend on our customers’ willingness to make expenditures to produce, develop and explore for oil and natural gas. Industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors, such as oil and natural gas prices, the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and worldwide economic conditions, political instability in oil producing countries and available supply of and demand for the services we provide. Oil and natural gas prices began a rapid and substantial decline in the fourth quarter of 2014. Depressed commodity price conditions persisted and worsened during 2015 and that trend continued into 2016. As a result, the rig count and demand for our products and services declined substantially, and the prices we are able to charge our customers for our products and services have also declined substantially. While we have reshaped our organizational and cost structure to mitigate the negative impact of these declines and to improve our ability to react to future declines, we continued to experience negative operating results and cash flows from operations through 2016.
 
Oil prices have improved off the low point of 2016 with the November 2016 decision by OPEC to curtail the cartel’s oil production, the Baker Hughes U.S. land drilling rig count has increased significantly from its low point in mid-2016, and our revenue has improved substantially during the first six months of 2017. We believe that stability in oil prices at an attractive price to our customers coupled with the increases in drilling activity during the first half of 2017 will result in further increases in demand for our services and will provide us opportunities to increase the price of our products and services, particularly in 2018. However, with increased demand for oilfield services broadly, the demand for qualified employees and the demand for the sub-rental equipment we require to increase our activity will increase and we may experience increases in costs which we cannot completely offset with price increases to our customers. As of June 30, 2017, based on our expectations of improved activity levels and pricing throughout the remainder of 2017 and 2018, we believe that we will be able to service our debt obligations and ongoing operations through operating cash flow and, if necessary, availability under our credit facility.

Operational Restructuring
 
Our activity is tied directly to the rig count and, even though we instituted significant cost cutting measures beginning in 2015, we were unable to cut costs enough to match the decline in our business. As a result, as of December 31, 2015, we were in default of our credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”).
 
Throughout 2015, in an effort to mitigate the significant declines in pricing and utilization of our equipment, we committed to a reorganization initiative to strengthen our sales and marketing efforts, consolidate support functions, and operate more efficiently. The reorganization effort included, but was not limited to, training our salesforce to enable the cross-selling of our product lines in certain geographical markets, sharing a common support services infrastructure across all reporting units, reducing headcount and wage rates, and rebranding and launching a new web site to increase awareness of our service lines. We recognized some benefit from these measures in late 2015 resulting in increased gross margins and lower selling, general and administrative expenses when compared to the first half of 2015.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we entered into a series of forbearance agreements with our lender. Under the forbearance agreements, among other provisions, the lenders agreed to forbear from exercising their remedies under the credit agreement. These forbearance agreements permitted us to operate within the parameters of our normal course of business despite the continuing default under the credit agreement. Without these forbearance agreements, our outstanding debt would have been immediately due and payable. Throughout 2016, we remained in default and we did not have sufficient liquidity to repay all of the outstanding debt to the lender at any point during the year ($20.1 million as of December 31, 2015). As such, we may have been forced to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
 
In early 2016, we were hopeful that a successful operational restructuring would facilitate negotiations to modify the terms of our existing credit facility with Wells Fargo. Our operational restructuring in 2016 consisted of severe cost cuts which were incremental to the year-over-year cost cuts already achieved in 2015 when compared to 2014. In 2016, significant cost savings were primarily generated by:
 
 
· | reductions of our employee base, both field employees and sales and administrative employees, to a headcount of approximately 50 as of December 31, 2016 from approximately 125 as of December 31, 2015, 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | reduction in employer contributions to employee benefits, 
· | closures of certain operating yards and administrative facilities, 
· | strategic decision to cease operations in the northeast which resulted in the reduction of costs related to operating in an incremental market, 
· | modifications to insurance policies, including general liability and workers’ compensation policies, resulting in a $0.5 million or 15.5% reduction in the cost of insurance to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015,
· | minimization of repair and maintenance activities, resulting in a $0.4 million or 50.0% reduction of repair and maintenance expenses to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and 
· | elimination of investments in equipment, unless required to service an existing customer, resulting in a reduction of capital expenditures to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

 
We also achieved significant cost savings from the decrease in third party costs, such as sub-rental equipment and trucking, and other variable costs which declined with the decrease in activity.
 
In order to further support our working capital needs, we identified and sold idle and underutilized assets. During 2016, we realized aggregate proceeds from sales of approximately $0.8 million of which $0.5 million and $0.3 million was used to fund working capital needs and pay down debt, respectively (see “Note 4 – Reduction in Value of Assets and Other Charges” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements).
 
Capital Restructuring
 
Despite our successful operational restructuring efforts, particularly during the first half of 2016, the decline in our activity levels and the declines in customer pricing outpaced the impact of our cost reductions and it became evident that a capital restructuring would also be necessary to continue operations and position our business for an industry turnaround.
 
In the second quarter of 2016, certain of the Company’s principal stockholders (“Shareholder Group”) began negotiations with Wells Fargo with the objective of consummating a recapitalization transaction (the “Recapitalization”) whereby our obligations under the credit agreement and the outstanding capital leases in favor of Wells Fargo’s equipment finance affiliate and certain other obligations of Aly Energy (collectively the “Aly Senior Obligations”) would be restructured. In August 2016, the Shareholder Group was introduced to a third party, Tiger Finance, LLC (“Tiger”), to provide bridge financing and to extend forbearance until such date as sufficient capital could be raised to complete the Recapitalization.
 

6

 
In September 2016, the Shareholder Group formed Permian Pelican, LLC (“Pelican”) with the objective of raising capital and executing the steps necessary to complete the restructuring, inclusive of successfully effecting the exchange of the Aly Operating redeemable preferred stock, Aly Centrifuge redeemable preferred stock, Aly Centrifuge subordinated debt and liability for a contingent payment into approximately 10% of our common stock on a fully diluted basis. 
 
Effective January 31, 2017, the Recapitalization was completed through the execution and delivery of a Securities Exchange Agreement and a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As a result of the Recapitalization, the Company became a “Controlled Company” as defined under the listing standards of the principal national securities exchanges; however, since the Shareholder Group’s proportionate interest did not change significantly, a change in control did not occur and the transaction was accounted for at historical cost.
 
As a result of the Recapitalization, the credit facility, now with Pelican, consisted of a term loan of $5.1 million and a revolving credit facility of up to $1.0 million as of January 31, 2017. Availability under the revolving credit facility is determined by a borrowing base calculated as 80% of eligible receivables (receivables less than 90 days old).
 
Subsequent to the Recapitalization, we entered into several further amendments to capitalize on improved market conditions and increased activity in our business:
 
 
· | Amendment No. 1, effective March 1, 2017, provided for a delayed draw term loan to be added to the credit facility for the purpose of financing capital expenditures. The agreement permitted us to draw on the delayed draw term loan from time-to-time up until the maturity date of the facility in order to fund up to 80% of the cost of capital expenditures subject to a $0.5 million limit on aggregate borrowings. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Amendment No. 2, effective May 23, 2017, increased the maximum revolving credit amount from $1.0 million to $1.8 million and extended the final maturity date of the facility to December 31, 2019. In consideration of the increase in the revolving credit facility and the extension of the final maturity date, we agreed to issue to Pelican, the lender, as an amendment fee, 1,200 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. 
· | Amendment No. 3, effective June 15, 2017, modified maximum potential borrowings under each of the revolving credit facility and the delayed draw term loan without changing the aggregate available borrowings under the credit facility. The amendment reduced the maximum revolving credit amount from $1.8 million to $1.0 million and increased the maximum delayed draw loan borrowings from $0.5 million to $1.3 million and the amendment also increased permitted draws on the delayed draw loan from 80% of the cost of capital expenditures being funded to 90% of the cost of capital expenditures being funded.

 
To the extent there is free cash flow as defined in the credit agreement, principal payments of 50% of such free cash flow are due annually. The maturity date of all remaining outstanding balances under the credit facility is December 31, 2019.
 
The obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our assets. The credit agreement contains customary events of default and covenants including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures, pay dividends or make other distributions, grant liens and sell assets. The credit facility does not include any financial covenants. We are in full compliance with the credit facility as of June 30, 2017.
 
As of June 30, 2017, there were outstanding borrowings of $5.0 million, $0.8 million, and $0.3 million on the term loan, revolving credit facility, and delayed draw term loan, respectively. As of June 30, 2017, we have the availability to borrow an incremental $0.2 million under the revolving credit facility and, if we have capital expenditures which are eligible to be financed, an incremental $1.0 million under the delayed draw term loan to finance 90% of such expenditures.

Strategy
 
Since 2012, we have made significant investments to expand operations and capitalize on organic growth opportunities in existing and expansion markets. We consistently seek opportunities to bundle product offerings and to cross sell services across markets and product lines, which we believe increases client retention and the utilization of our equipment.

7

 
Our growth strategy focuses on pursuing organic growth and, when capital resources are available, acquiring existing businesses. The strategy consists of the following elements:
 
 
· | increase inventory of rental products and increase capacity to provide services;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | add new and differentiated product and service offerings; 
· | expand into new geographic markets; and, 
· | diversify and grow our customer base. 

Products and Services
 
We are a provider of solids control systems and surface rental equipment. Our equipment and services are primarily designed for and used in land-based horizontal drilling. Our equipment includes centrifuges and auxiliary solids control equipment, mud circulating tanks (400 and 500 barrel capacity) and auxiliary surface rental equipment (e.g. portable mud mixing plants, and containment systems). In conjunction with the rental of some of our solids control packages, we provide personnel at the customer’s well site to operate our equipment. We also provide personnel to rig-up/rig-down and haul our equipment to and from the customer’s location.
Our Rental Products:
 
Centrifuges: We currently own approximately 54 centrifuges. We provide two different sizes of centrifuges to meet varying client specifications (i.e. SS1000 and SS2000). We believe our centrifuges provide a competitive advantage because the rotating assembly within each centrifuge can be removed and replaced on a customer’s well site within 45 minutes if it fails thereby minimizing downtime.
Mud Circulating Tanks (“MCTs”): We currently own approximately 60 vertical 400-barrel MCTs and approximately 125 500-barrel MCTs. We developed vertical 400-barrel MCTs as an innovative solution that minimizes location size, which we believe is an attractive feature for customers. The majority of our 500-barrel MCTs are highly mobile with rounded bottoms and customized jet-lines to ensure more consistent mud and easier cleanout at the completion of a job. In addition to the 500-barrel MCTs we own, we sub-rent 500-barrel MCTs (approximately 235 sub-rented as of June 30, 2017) in order to satisfy demand for our services. MCTs are typically rented to customers with auxiliary equipment such as diesel or electric mud pumps, hoses, and wooden mats.
Mud Mixing Plants (“MMPs”): We own 9 MMPs ranging in size from 100-barrel capacity to 500-barrel capacity. We believe that the large 400-barrel and 500-barrel capacity MMPs, which are designed and fabricated in-house, are unique and offer significant advantages to our customers.
Containment Systems: Containment systems consist of berms and plastic linings constructed to ensure that all products and chemicals present on the well site, particularly those which might be environmentally undesirable if spilled, are contained. We believe the demand for containment systems will continue to increase as environmental regulations tighten.
 
Solids control equipment rental: We provide a variety of solids control equipment used in and critical to wellsite activities including shakers, vertical dryers, waste removal units, and/or various tanks.
 
Our Service Offerings Which Include Personnel:
 
Solids Control Services: When a customer’s solids control operations are complex, we provide operators on-site 24 hours a day at an additional day rate. In these instances, we typically rent a full package of solids control equipment to the customer, which may include two centrifuges, shakers, vertical dryers, waste removal units, and/or various tanks. 
 
Hauling of Equipment and Rig-Up/Rig-Down Services: We offer hauling of our rental equipment to the well site and rig-up/rig-down of such equipment. 
 
Fabricating Capabilities
 
We fabricate certain equipment in our rental fleet, including 400-barrel MCTs and MMPs. Fabrication primarily takes place in our facility in Giddings, Texas. Items fabricated in-house are typically unique and we believe our ability to fabricate such products in-house provides us with cost efficiencies that result in a competitive advantage. 
Geographic Markets
 
We operate primarily in Texas (West Texas and South Texas), Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Louisiana.

Competition
 
We experience significant competition in our business. The markets in which we operate are highly fragmented and there are a large number of companies in these markets offering rental equipment and services that overlap with our offerings. We believe the principal differentiators among competitors in the sectors and markets in which we operate are safety record, service quality, existence of unique attributes of equipment that benefit the customer, customer relationships, response time and price. 
 
The level of our revenue, earnings and cash flows are substantially dependent upon, and affected by, the level of U.S. oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activity, as well as the equipment capacity in any particular region.

 
Customers
 
We provide equipment and services to several well-known, established operators, such as EOG Resources, Inc., Pioneer Natural Resources, Sanchez Oil and Gas Corporation, Encana, Continental Resources, Inc. and Devon Energy Corporation.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our top three customers represented approximately 43.5% and 35.4% of total revenue, respectively. 
 
If we are unable to continue to provide services to our top three existing customers and sales to new or other existing customers do not increase sufficiently, our business and operations could be materially adversely affected.
 
Raw Materials
 
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts and components that are made by other manufacturers and suppliers for our use. We are not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies or materials. 

Safety
 
Our record and reputation for safety is important to all aspects of our business. In the oilfield services industry, an important competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long-term customer relationships is having an experienced, skilled and well-trained work force. In recent years, many of our larger customers have placed an added emphasis on the safety records and quality management systems of their vendors.
 
We commit substantial resources toward employee safety and quality management. We believe our policies and procedures provide a solid framework to ensure our employees minimize the hazards inherent in our work environment, meet regulatory requirements and exceed customer expectations.
 
Employees
 
As of July 24, 2017, we employed approximately 50 individuals. The corporate cost center employs four individuals, including the chairman, the chief executive officer, the chief operating officer and the chief financial officer, approximately 40 individuals work primarily in the field, and the remaining employees provide selling, general, and administrative services. We believe we have good relationships with our employees.

Seasonality
 
We have historically experienced a slowdown during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday seasons and demand in the fourth quarter sometimes slows during this period as our customers exhaust their annual spending budgets. 
Intangibles
 
We are not dependent on any significant patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts. In the last two years, we have not spent or incurred a material amount on research and development activities.
Governmental Regulation
 
Our business is impacted by federal, state and local laws and other regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry, as well as laws and regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection. We cannot predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations or how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings, whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted, or the effect such changes may have on us, our business or financial condition.
 
In addition, our customers are impacted by laws and regulations relating to the exploration for and production of natural resources such as oil and natural gas. These regulations are subject to change, and new regulations may curtail or eliminate our customers’ activities in certain areas where we currently operate. We cannot determine the extent to which new legislation may impact our customers’ activity levels, and ultimately, the demand for our services.

 
Environmental Matters
 
Our operations, and those of our customers, are subject to extensive laws, regulations and treaties relating to air and water quality, generation, storage and handling of hazardous materials, and emission and discharge of materials into the environment. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all regulations affecting our business. Historically, our expenditures in furtherance of our compliance with these laws, regulations and treaties have not been material, and we do not expect the cost of compliance to be material in the future.

Access to Company Reports
 
We make available, free of charge, on our website, www.alyenergy.com, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports on the same day as they are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
