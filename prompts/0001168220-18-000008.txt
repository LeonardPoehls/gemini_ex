Company Mission and Strategy
 
ULURU Inc. (together with our subsidiaries, "We", "ULURU" or the "Company") is a Nevada corporation.
 We are a specialty medical technology company committed to developing and commercializing a range of innovative wound care and muco-adhesive film products based on our patented Nanoflex® and OraDiscTM technologies, with the goal of improving outcomes for patients, health care professionals and payers.
 
Utilizing these two platform technologies, a number of products were developed of which one is being actively marketed in the wound care market. This product, Altrazeal® Transforming Powder Dressing ("Altrazeal®"), based on our Nanoflex® technology, has the potential to change the way health care providers approach the treatment of wounds.   Altrazeal® is indicated for both exuding acute wounds such as partial thickness burns, donor sites, surgical and traumatic wounds, and also for chronic wounds such as venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, and pressure ulcers. Altrazeal® is registered for sale with the United States Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA"), the European Union (the "EU") and a number of other international markets.
 
Our current strategy is to primarily focus on the commercialization of Altrazeal® and to establish a market leadership position in wound management by developing and commercializing a customer focused portfolio of innovative wound care products.  We will also evaluate the potential for commercialization of the other products as well as explore strategic collaborations to further develop our oral mucoadhesive film technology (OraDiscTM) for systemic drug delivery and for delivery of actives to the oral cavity.
 
We will also continue to execute a series of operational plans launched in 2017 to enhance and streamline our business operations and improve efficiency and reduce costs, including production, distribution, and administration costs. We are also undertaking efforts to stimulate sales, enhance marketing, and expedite regulatory approvals for new market entry of Altrazeal®.

Core Technology Platforms
 
Nanoflex® Technology
 
The Nanoflex® technology platform provides the ability to formulate a variety of unique materials through the aggregation of hydrogel-like particles. This concept takes advantage of the inherent biocompatibility of hydrogels. Unlike bulk hydrogels, these aggregates are shape retentive, can be extruded or molded, and offer properties suitable for use in a variety of in-vivo medical devices, and in novel drug delivery systems. The polymers used in our Nanoflex® technology have been extensively researched and commercialized into several major medical products including contact lenses and other FDA-approved implants.  They are generally accepted as safe, non-toxic and biocompatible.
 
Utilizing our proprietary Nanoflex® technology, we have developed a Nanoflex® Powder platform. Our Nanoflex® Powder is a novel wound treatment technology used to promote the healing of exuding wounds.  We believe that the scientifically engineered material has qualities not available in other dressings currently available in terms of properties and performance, and can be used in chronic, acute, surgical and traumatic wounds.  It is formulated as a two-polymer blend in a specific ratio.  In the presence of wound exudate, the particles hydrate and aggregate to conform to the contours of the wound bed, transforming into a moist, flexible, moisture-permeable dressing. This dressing formed not only provides an optimal moist wound environment which supports cellular function and tissue repair, but it is also of appropriate pore size to prevent intrusion by exogenous bacteria.  After application to the wound bed, Nanoflex® Powder exhibits mechanical properties which are similar to soft tissue.  The stable, non-resorbable film flakes off at the edges as the wound heals, like a scab. It can remain in place for an extended period as compared to other dressings if exudate is present and can be removed without additional trauma, leaving no residue in the wound bed.  Nanoflex® Powder may also have the potential to serve as a drug delivery matrix for antiseptics, and there is potential for its use as a delivery platform for anti-inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids, pro-angiogenic agents, and other actives such as growth factors to accelerate wound healing.
 
Mucoadhesive OraDiscTM Technology
 
Treatment of oral conditions generally relies upon the use of medications formulated as gels and pastes, which are applied to lesions in the mouth. The duration of effectiveness of these medications is typically short because the applied dose is worn away through the mechanical actions of speaking, eating, and tongue movement, and is washed away by saliva flow. To address these problems, we developed a novel erodible mucoadhesive film product. This technology, known as OraDisc™, comprises a multi-layered film having an adhesive layer, a pre-formed film layer, and a coated backing layer. Depending upon the intended application, a pharmaceutically active compound can be formulated within any of these layers, providing a wide range of potential applications. The disc stays in place eroding over a period of time, so that subsequent removal is unnecessary. The drug delivery rate may be adjusted by altering the rate of erosion of the disc, which is in turn controlled by the composition of the backing layer.
 
Our adhesive film technology has the potential for multiple applications, including the localized delivery of drug to a mucosal site, use as a transmucosal delivery device for delivering drugs into the systemic circulation, and incorporating the drug in the outer layer for delivery into the oral cavity. The adhesive film will adhere to any wet mucosal surface. Additionally, the adhesive film has been formulated to adhere to the surface of teeth and gums for the delivery of dental health and cosmetic dental actives. Initial drug delivery studies using our adhesive film technology indicate the potential to achieve significantly higher drug exposure and higher blood level concentrations.
 
OraDisc™ A was initially developed as a drug delivery system to treat canker sores using Amlexanox as the active ingredient, which is the same active ingredient that was used in our Aphthasol® paste which was also developed for the treatment of canker sores but has not been commercialized.
 
OraDisc™ B was developed for the treatment of oral pain using 15 mg of Benzocaine, the maximum allowable strength that falls under the classification of an OTC monograph product in the United States.
 
Although we are not currently marketing or selling OraDisc™ A or OraDisc™ B, we intend to explore the viability of commercializing these products in the future through strategic collaborations.

Marketed Products
 
We are currently focusing our resources and efforts primarily on the marketing of Altrazeal®.
 
Altrazeal®
 
Altrazeal® Transforming Powder Dressing, based on our Nanoflex® technology, has the potential to change the way health care providers approach the treatment of wounds.  The product is indicated for exuding wounds such as partial thickness burns, donor sites, abrasions, non-healing and other surgical wounds, trauma and chronic wounds including diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers. The powder is used to fill and seal the wound to provide an optimal moist wound healing environment. The wound exudate is controlled through the high moisture vapor transpiration rate ("MVTR") of the material.  Intimate contact at the wound bed supports cellular function and tissue repair. Other characteristics of Altrazeal® that promote healing are oxygen permeability and its ability to prevent the entry of bacteria.  Patient comfort is enhanced with the reduced frequency of dressing changes and the easy application and removal of our wound dressing.  In numerous clinical settings, including venous leg ulcers, arterial ulcers and second-degree burns, significant pain reduction has been reported by patients, enabling increased compliance to therapy and improved clinical outcomes.  The dressing is flexible and adherent and is designed to allow greater range of motion. In addition, the ability of Altrazeal® to manage wound exudates extends the wear time between dressing changes, which offers a significant pharmaco-economic benefit.  This feature is considered an extremely important marketing advantage in countries where there are socialized medical programs.

Altrazeal® is a 510(k)-exempt product and has been registered with the FDA. It has also been granted registrations in a number of international markets, including a CE Mark Certification which enables us to market in all European Union member states and other countries that recognize the CE Mark.
 
Since the roll-out of Altrazeal®, numerous positive clinical experiences have been documented. The focus of our commercial activities is to introduce Altrazeal® globally both directly and through our network of distribution partners. Due to the efforts of our current and former distribution partners, Altrazeal® has contractual partners in many of the major international territories.
 
As part of the Company's current turn-around plan, we are continuing to evaluate all of our distribution relationships to ensure that they meet the criteria for advancing the Company's current business plan. We are also evaluating potential launch strategies for the U.S. market.
 
Patents
 
We believe that the value of technology both to us and to our potential corporate partners is established and enhanced by our intellectual property positions. Consequently, we have already been issued U.S. and foreign patents for products under development and for new discoveries. Patent applications are filed for our inventions and prospective products with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and, when appropriate, with authorities in countries that are a part of the Paris Convention's Patent Cooperation Treaty ("PCT") (most major countries in Western Europe and the Far East) and with other authorities in major markets not covered by the PCT.  However, due to our previous liquidity situation, certain of our patents and patent applications may have lapsed.
 
With regards to our Nanoflex® technology, two patents have issued in the U.S. and multiple patents have been issued in international countries.  There is a PCT patent application that was filed with multiple pending patent applications and granted patents in various international countries.  The granted patents and patent applications have a variety of potential applications, such as wound management, burn care, dermal fillers, artificial discs and tissue scaffold.
 
We have one U.S. patent for our OraDisc™ technology.  This oral delivery vehicle potentially overcomes the difficulties encountered in using conventional paste and gel formulations for conditions in the mouth. Utilizing this technology, we anticipate that higher drug concentrations will be achieved at the disease site, increasing the effectiveness of the product.  Our patent covers the delivery of drugs through or into any mucosal surface. The patent covers our ability to control the erosion time of the adhesive film and the subsequent drug release by adjusting the ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic polymers in the outer layer of the composite film.

Manufacturing and Supply
 
We currently rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers, monitored by our internal management, to manufacture, package, and finish our products and do not currently have relationships with alternate suppliers. We continue to evaluate all of our contract manufacturers for efficiency, regulatory compliance, and cost-effectiveness.  We believe that there are other contract manufacturers that can satisfy our production requirements, but should it be necessary to change suppliers this could result in a delay in production while they are qualified and validated.
Marketing and Distribution
 
We do not currently have the resources to market and distribute our products directly through an in-house sales force and distribution network.  As a result, we have entered into agreements to market and distribute our products through distributors.
 
Revenues per geographic area, along with relative percentages of total revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are described in greater detail in Note 4 of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
 
Significant Customers
 
A significant portion of our revenues are derived from a few major customers.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, three customers had greater than 10% of total revenues and jointly represented 92% of total revenues.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, three customers had greater than 10% of total revenues and jointly represented 88% of total revenues.
Research and Development, Quality Management, and Regulatory Affairs
 
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we expended approximately $240,000 and $445,000, respectively in research and development, regulatory affairs and quality management activities.  The costs incurred for each of the two years are primarily attributable to maintaining our quality management system and with registration of Altrazeal® in new territories.
Government Regulation
 
Our business is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety. Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of subjective interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change, or new laws may be enacted.
 
Both federal and state governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. We believe that we have structured our business operations and relationships with our customers to comply with all applicable legal requirements. However, it is possible that governmental entities or other third parties could interpret these laws differently and assert otherwise. We discuss below the statutes and regulations most relevant to our business.

US Food and Drug Administration regulation of medical devices.
 
The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the "FDCA") and FDA regulations establish a comprehensive system for the regulation of medical devices intended for human use. Our products include medical devices that are subject to these, as well as other federal, state, local and foreign, laws and regulations. The FDA is responsible for enforcing the laws and regulations governing medical devices in the United States.
 
The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes - Class I, Class II, or Class III depending on their level of risk and the types of controls that are necessary to ensure device safety and effectiveness. The class assignment is a factor in determining the type of premarketing submission or application, if any, that will be required before marketing in the United States.
 

· | Class I devices present a low risk and are not life-sustaining or life-supporting. The majority of Class I devices are subject only to "general controls" -e.g., prohibition against adulteration and misbranding, registration and listing, good manufacturing practices, labeling, and adverse event reporting. General controls are baseline requirements that apply to all classes of medical devices. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Class II devices present a moderate risk and are devices for which general controls alone are not sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Devices in Class II are subject to both general controls and "special controls" -e.g., special labeling, compliance with industry standards, and post market surveillance. Unless exempted, Class II devices typically require FDA clearance before marketing, through the premarket notification (510(k) process.) 
· | De novo application process provides a pathway to Class II classification for medical devices for general and special controls provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, but for which there is no legally marketed predicate device. 
· | Class III devices present the highest risk. These devices generally are life-sustaining, life-supporting, or for a use that is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health or present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Class III devices are devices for which general controls, by themselves, are insufficient and for which there is insufficient information to establish special controls to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class III devices are subject to general controls and typically require FDA approval of a premarket approval ("PMA") application before marketing.

 
Unless it is exempt from premarket review requirements, a medical device must receive marketing authorization from the FDA prior to being commercially marketed, distributed or sold in the United States. The most common pathways for obtaining marketing authorization are 510(k) clearance and PMA.
 
510(k) Pathway.
 
The 510(k)-review process compares a new device to a legally marketed device. Through the 510(k) process, the FDA determines whether a new medical device is "substantially equivalent" to a legally marketed device (i.e., predicate device) that is not subject to PMA requirements. "Substantial equivalence" means that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and the same or similar technological characteristics, or if there are differences in technological characteristics, the differences do not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate, and the information submitted in the 510(k) demonstrates that the proposed device is as safe and effective as the predicate device.
To obtain 510(k) clearance, a company must submit a 510(k)-application containing sufficient information and data to demonstrate that its proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device. These data generally include non-clinical performance testing (e.g., software validation, animal testing electrical safety testing), but may also include clinical data. Typically, it takes three to twelve months for the FDA to complete its review of a 510(k) submission; however, it can take significantly longer and clearance is never assured. During its review of a 510(k), the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process. After completing its review of a 510(k), the FDA may issue an order, in the form of a letter, that finds the device to be either (1) substantially equivalent and states that the device can be marketed in the United States, or (2) not substantially equivalent and states that device cannot be marketed in the United States. Depending upon the reasons for the not substantially equivalent finding, the device may need to be approved through the PMA pathway (discussed below) prior to commercialization.
 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, including significant modifications to any of our products or procedures, requires submission and clearance of a new 510(k). The FDA relies on each manufacturer to make and document this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer's determination. We may make minor product enhancements that we believe do not require new 510(k) clearance. If the FDA disagrees with our determination regarding whether a new 510(k) clearance was required for these modifications, we may need to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device. The FDA may also subject us to other enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, issuing a warning letter or untitled letter to us, seizing our products, imposing civil penalties, or initiating criminal prosecution.

Premarket Approval Pathway.
 
Unlike the comparative standard of the 510(k) pathway, the PMA approval process requires an independent demonstration of the safety and effectiveness of a device. PMA is the most stringent type of device marketing application required by the FDA. PMA approval is based on a determination by the FDA that the PMA contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to ensure that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). A PMA application generally includes extensive information about the device including the results of clinical testing conducted on the device and a detailed description of the manufacturing process.
 
After a PMA application is accepted for review, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information. FDA regulations provide 180 days to review the PMA and make a determination; however, the review time is normally longer (e.g., 1-3 years). During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the data supporting the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to whether the data provide a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. In addition, the FDA generally will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with QSR, which imposes comprehensive development, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements for the design and manufacturing of a medical device.
 
Based on its review, the FDA may (1) issue an order approving the PMA, (2) issue a letter stating the PMA is "approvable" (e.g., minor additional information is needed), (3) issue a letter stating the PMA is "not approvable," or (4) issue an order denying PMA. A company may not market a device subject to PMA review until the FDA issues an order approving the PMA. As part of a PMA approval, the FDA may impose post-approval conditions intended to ensure the continued safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and requiring the collection of additional clinical data. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.
Most modifications to a PMA approved device, including changes to the design, labeling, or manufacturing process, require prior approval before being implemented. Prior approval is obtained through submission of a PMA supplement. The type of information required to support a PMA supplement and the FDA's time for review of a PMA supplement vary depending on the nature of the modification.
 
Clinical Trials.
 
Clinical trials of medical devices in the United States are governed by the FDA's Investigational Device Exemption ("IDE") regulation. This regulation places significant responsibility on the sponsor of the clinical study including, but not limited to, choosing qualified investigators, monitoring the trial, submitting required reports, maintaining required records, and assuring investigators obtain informed consent, comply with the study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, submit required reports, etc.
 
Clinical trials of significant risk devices (e.g., implants, devices used in supporting or sustaining human life, devices of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health) require FDA and Institutional Review Board ("IRB"), approval prior to starting the trial. FDA approval is obtained through submission of an IDE application. Clinical trials of non-significant risk ("NSR"), devices (i.e. devices that do not meet the regulatory definition of a significant risk device) only require IRB approval before starting. The clinical trial sponsor is responsible for making the initial determination of whether a clinical study is significant risk or NSR; however, a reviewing IRB and/or FDA may review this decision and disagree with the determination.
 
An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as performance data, animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to evaluate the device in humans and that the clinical study protocol is scientifically sound. There is no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials. Additionally, after a trial begins, the FDA may place it on hold or terminate it if, among other reasons, it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 
As noted above, the FDA may require a company to collect clinical data on a device in the post market setting.
 
The collection of such data may be required as a condition of PMA approval. The FDA also has the authority to order, via a letter, a post market surveillance study for certain devices at any time after they have been cleared or approved.

Continuing FDA regulation.
 
After a device is placed on the market, regardless of its classification or premarket pathway, numerous additional FDA requirements generally apply. These include, but are not limited to:
 

· | Establishment registration and device listing requirements; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Quality System Regulation ("QSR"), which governs the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of finished devices; 
· | Labeling requirements, which mandate the inclusion of certain content in device labels and labeling, and generally require the label and package of medical devices to include a unique device identifier ("UDI"), and which also prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved, i.e., "off-label," uses; 
· | Medical Device Reporting ("MDR"), regulation, which requires that manufacturers and importers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and 
· | Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation, which requires that manufacturers and importers report to the FDA recalls (i.e., corrections or removals) if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; manufacturers and importers must keep records of recalls that they determine to be not reportable.

 
The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include, but is not limited to, the following sanctions:
 

· | Untitled letters or warning letters; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Fines, injunctions and civil penalties; 
· | Recall or seizure of our products; 
· | Operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
· | Refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products; 
· | Withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted; and
· | Criminal prosecution. 

 
We are subject to unannounced device inspections by the FDA, as well as other regulatory agencies overseeing the implementation of and compliance with applicable state public health regulations. These inspections may include our suppliers' facilities.
 
Marketing Approvals Outside the United States.
 
Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ.  Currently, a substantial portion of our sales are being made in Europe.  Under the European Union Medical Device Directive (the "EU MDD"), medical devices must meet the EU MDD requirements and receive a CE marking certification prior to marketing in the European Union, or EU, which we have received for Altrazeal®. CE marking is the uniform labeling system of products designed to facilitate the supervision and control of the EU concerning manufacturers' compliance with the various regulations and directives of the EU and to clarify the obligations imposed in the various legislative provisions in the EU. Use of a uniform product labeling indicates compliance with all the directives and regulations required for the application of such labeling, and it is effective as a manufacturer's declaration that the product meets the required criteria and technical specifications of the relevant authorities such as health, safety, and environmental protection. CE marking ensures free trade between the EU and European Free Trade Association countries (Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) and permits the enforcement and customs authorities in European countries not to allow the marketing of similar products that do not bear the CE marking sign. Such certification allows, among other things, marking the products (according to various categories) with the CE marking and their sale and marketing in the EU.
 
 - 9 -
 
CE marking certification requires a comprehensive quality system program, comprehensive technical documentation and data on the product, which are then reviewed by a Notified Body, or NB. An NB is an organization designated by the national governments of the EU member states to make independent judgments about whether a product complies with the EU MDD requirements and to grant the CE marking if we, and our product, comply with specified terms. After receiving the CE marking, we must pass a review carried out by the competent NB annually, under which it audits our facilities to verify our compliance with the ISO 13485 quality system standard.
 
Compliance with the ISO 13485 standard, for medical device quality management systems, is required for regulatory purposes. ISO standards are recognized international quality standards that are designed to ensure that we develop and manufacture quality medical devices. Other countries are also instituting regulations regarding medical devices. Compliance with these regulations requires extensive documentation and clinical reports for all our product candidates, revisions to labeling, and other requirements such as facility inspections to comply with the registration requirements.
 
Many other countries, outside of the United States and Europe, have requirements and regulations similar to those in the United States and/or Europe.  As we attempt to expand our business into each new country, we will be required to comply with any applicable eligibility, registration, quality, reporting and other requirements applicable to the marketing and sale of medical devices in that market.
 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements.
 
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the CMS, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. These regulations include:

· | the federal healthcare program anti-kickback law which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government reimbursement programs that are false or fraudulent. The government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback law or related to off-label promotion constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal false claims laws; 
· | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
· | the federal transparency requirements under the Health Care Reform Law requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to physician payments and other transfers of value and physician ownership and investment interests; 
· | the Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
· | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

 
 - 10 -
 
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's privacy and security standards directly applicable to "business associates"—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
Post-Marketing Regulations.
 
Following approval of a new product, a company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and other federal and state regulatory authorities, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting for uses or in patient populations not described in the product's approved labeling (known as "off-label use"), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the products or labeling or changes of site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process.
 
Other Regulatory Matters.
 
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS"), other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments. Sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with federal and state fraud and abuse laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the US Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair completion laws.
 
The distribution of medical device products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of medical device products.
 
Competition
 
The industry that we compete in is characterized by intense competition, rapid product development and technological change.  Competition in the industry is generally based upon quality, efficacy, price, accessibility and service.  Competition is intense among manufacturers of prescription pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and other product areas where we may develop and market products in the future.  Most of our potential competitors in the wound care market such as Smith & Nephew plc, Acelity L.P. Inc., ConvaTec Inc., 3M Company, and Molnlycke Health Care are large, well established medical device or healthcare companies with considerably greater financial, marketing, sales and technical resources than are available to us. Additionally, many of our potential competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow such competitors to develop new or improved products that may compete with our product lines.  Our potential products could be rendered obsolete or made uneconomical by the development of new products to treat the conditions to be addressed by our developments, technological advances affecting the cost of production, or marketing or pricing actions by one or more of our potential competitors.  Our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected by any one or more of such developments.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competition will not have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We are aware of certain developmental projects for products to treat or prevent certain diseases targeted by us.  The existence of these potential products or other products or treatments of which we are not aware, or products or treatments that may be developed in the future, may adversely affect the marketability of products developed by us.

In the area of wound management, which is the focus of our development activities, a number of companies are developing or evaluating new technology approaches.  We expect that technological developments will occur at a rapid rate and that competition is likely to intensify as various alternative technologies achieve similar, if not identical or superior, advantages.
 
Wound care products developed from our Nanoflex® technology, including Altrazeal®, will compete with numerous well-established products including technologies for hydrogels, films, alginates, foams and others wound care technologies that may be marketed by Smith & Nephew plc, Acelity L.P. Inc., ConvaTec Inc., 3M Company, and Molnlycke Health Care.
 
Any products developed from OraDisc™ erodible film technology, for the controlled release of pharmaceutical actives, will compete with numerous alternative drug delivery technologies including fast release film technology, transdermal drug delivery, and other mucoadhesive film technologies.
 
Even if our products are fully developed and receive the required regulatory approval, of which there can be no assurance, we believe that our products require extensive sales efforts directed both at the medical professional and the consumer and can only compete successfully if marketed by companies with relevant expertise.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had two full-time employees in general and administration.

Organizational History
 
We were incorporated on September 17, 1987 under the laws of the State of Nevada, originally under the name Casinos of the World, Inc.  From April 1993 to January 2002, the Company changed its name on four separate occasions, with Oxford Ventures, Inc. being the Company's name on January 30, 2002.
 
On March 29, 2006, we effected a 400:1 reverse stock split and, at the same time, authorized a decrease in authorized shares of Common Stock from 400,000,000 shares to 200,000,000 shares, and authorized up to 20,000 shares of Preferred Stock.
 
On March 31, 2006, a subsidiary of the Company, which had acquired, among other things, the net assets of the Nanoflex® and Mucoadhesive OraDisc™ technologies from Access Pharmaceuticals, Inc., merged with and into ULURU Inc., a Delaware corporation ("ULURU Delaware"), and ULURU Delaware became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  On March 31, 2006, we changed our name from "Oxford Ventures, Inc." to "ULURU Inc."  On the same date, we moved our executive offices to Addison, Texas.
 
On June 29, 2011, we effected a 15:1 reverse stock split.

On August 1, 2017, all 1,250 outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock held by Velo LLC automatically converted in exchange for 125,000,000 shares of Common Stock as a result of the approval by the stockholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on July 25, 2017, and the filing in July 2017, of an amendment increasing our authorized shares of Common Stock from 200,000,000 shares to 750,000,000 shares.
