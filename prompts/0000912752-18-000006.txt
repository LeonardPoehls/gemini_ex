ITEM 1.            BUSINESS

We are a diversified television broadcasting company with national reach with a strong focus on providing high-quality content on our local television stations and digital and other platforms.  The content, distributed through our broadcast platform, consists of programming provided by third-party networks and syndicators, local news, our own networks, and other original programming produced by us.  We also distribute our original programming, and owned and operated networks, on other third-party platforms.  Additionally, we own digital and internet media products that are complementary to our extensive portfolio of television station related digital properties. We focus on offering marketing solutions to advertisers through our television and digital platforms and digital agency services. Outside of our media related businesses, we operate technical services companies focused on supply and maintenance of broadcast transmission systems as well as research and development for the advancement of broadcast technology, and we manage other non-media related investments.
Broadcast
As of December 31, 2017, our broadcast distribution platform consists primarily of our broadcast television stations. We own, provide programming and operating services pursuant to local marketing agreements (LMAs), or provide sales services and other non-programming operating services pursuant to other outsourcing agreements (such as JSAs and SSAs) to 191 stations in 89 markets. These stations broadcast 601 channels, including 242 channels affiliated with primary networks or program service providers comprised of:  FOX (59), ABC (41), CBS (30), NBC (25), CW (47), and MyNetworkTV (MNT) (40).  The other 359 channels broadcast programming from Antenna TV, Azteca, Bounce Network, CHARGE!, Comet, CoziTV, Decades, Estrella TV, Get TV, Grit, Me TV, Movies!, Stadium Network, TBD, Telemundo, This TV, Unimas, Univision, Weather, and two channels broadcasting independent programming.  For the purpose of this report, these 191 stations and 601 channels are referred to as “our” stations and channels.  Refer to our Television Markets and Stations table later in this Item 1. for more information.
Our broadcast segment provides free over-the-air programming to television viewing audiences in the communities we serve through our local television stations.  The programming that we provide on our primary channels consists of network provided programs, locally-produced news, local sporting events, programming from program service arrangements, syndicated entertainment programs, and internally originated programming provided by our other media subsidiaries. We provide live, local sporting events on many of our stations by acquiring the local television broadcast rights for these events.  
We are the nation's largest producer of local news. We produce approximately 2,400 hours of news per week at 129 stations in 84 markets, including 3 stations which produce news pursuant to a local news sharing arrangement for competitive stations in that market.  We have 20 stations which have local news sharing arrangements with a competitive station in that market that produces the news aired on our station.  
See Operating Strategy later in this Item 1. for more information regarding the news and programming we provide.

A primary source of revenue is the sale of commercial inventory on our television stations to our advertising customers.  We also earn revenues by providing digital content to non-linear devices via websites, mobile, and social media advertisements. Our objective is to meet the needs of our advertising customers by delivering significant audiences in key demographics.  Our strategy is to achieve this objective by providing quality local news programming, popular network, syndicated and live sports programs, and other original content to our viewing audience.  We attract most of our national television advertisers through national marketing representation firms which have offices in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Atlanta.  Our local television advertisers are attracted through the use of a local sales force at each of our television stations, which is comprised of approximately 800 marketing consultants and 100 local sales managers company-wide.
Another primary source of revenue is from our retransmission consent agreements through payments from MVPDs in our markets, vMVPDs and OTT distributors.  The MVPDs are local cable companies, satellite television, and local telecommunication video providers.  vMVPDS and OTT distributors are companies that provide video content through internet streaming. The revenues primarily represent payments from the MVPDs, virtual MVPDs, and OTT distributors for access to our broadcast signal and are typically based on the number of subscribers they have.

Our operating results are subject to cyclical fluctuations from political advertising.  Political spending has been significantly higher in the even-number years due to the cyclicality of political elections.  In addition, every four years, political spending is typically elevated further due to the advertising related to the presidential election.  Because of the political election cyclicality, there has been a significant difference in our operating results when comparing even-numbered years’ performance to the odd numbered years’ performance.  Additionally, our operating results are impacted by the number and importance of individual political races and issues discussed on a national level as well as those within the local communities we serve.  We believe political advertising will continue to be a strong advertising category in our industry. Political advertising levels may increase further as political-activism, around social, political, economic and environmental causes, continues to draw attention and Political Action Committees (PACs), including so-called Super PACs, continue to increase spending.
Original Networks and Content
We own and operate various networks carried on distribution platforms owned by us or others including: Comet, our science fiction multicast network, which debuted in October 2015; CHARGE!, our adventure and action-based emerging network, which launched in February 2017; and TBD, the first multiscreen TV network in the U.S. market to bring premium internet-first content to TV homes across America, which launched in February 2017.
Also, during 2017, we transformed American Sports Network into Stadium, a new digital network that brings together professional sports highlights and college games. 
We also own and operate Tennis Channel (Tennis), a cable network acquired in March 2016, which includes coverage of many of tennis' top tournaments and original professional sport and tennis lifestyle shows. In 2017, Tennis expanded beyond its network business by acquiring Tennis Magazine, the sport’s largest print publication, and Tennis.com, the most visited online tennis platform in the world. 
Our internally developed content, in addition to our local news, includes Ring of Honor (ROH), our professional wrestling promotion, and Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson (Full Measure), our national Sunday morning investigative and political analysis program.
Digital and Internet
Sinclair Digital Ventures focuses on investment in emerging digital technologies, ad tech, and digital content companies that support and expand Sinclair's digital capabilities and non-linear footprint. We earn revenues from Compulse Integrated Marketing, a full service digital agency which uses our digital expertise to help businesses run social media, search, advertising, email marketing, web design, mobile marketing and creative services, and audience extension, and navigate and compete in a world of constant innovation and changes in consumer behavior. Circa is a national digital news operation offering video-rich news and entertainment tailored for mobile devices and aimed at the younger demographic. DataSphere Technologies, acquired in June 2017, provides marketing services to small businesses across the country and works in partnership with multiple media companies, including Sinclair. NewsON is a free, ad-supported app that provides instant access to live or on-demand local news broadcasts.
Technical Services
We own subsidiaries which are dedicated to providing broadcast related technical services to the broadcast industry, including: Acrodyne Technical Services, a provider of service and support for broadcast transmitters throughout the world; Dielectric, a designer and manufacturer of broadcast systems including all components from transmitter output to antenna; and ONE Media, a technology innovator at the forefront of developing industry standards and related technologies for NextGen encompassing its flexible and enhanced vision for broadcasting. In April 2016, we launched ONE Media 3.0, a wholly-owned subsidiary whose purpose will be to develop business opportunities, products, and services associated with ATSC 3.0 "Next Generation" broadcast transmission standard and TV platform. In 2017, we and other broadcasters formed the Spectrum Consortium (Spectrum Co), a joint venture that links local consortium member television stations to form a nationwide network over which to deliver national services and create a robust video and data exchange in conjunction with NextGen. 
Other Non-media Investments
We own various non-media related investments across multiple asset classes including private equity, mezzanine financing, and real estate investments. Some of the largest investments include: Triangle Sign and Service (Triangle), a sign designer and fabricator; Bay Creek South (Bay Creek), a land developer for a planned resort community in Cape Charles, VA; and Jefferson Park, a mixed-use land development project in Frederick, MD; an investment in sustainable energy producing facilities; and a portfolio of apartment complexes.

Operating Strategy
Programming to Attract Viewership.  We seek to target our programming offerings to attract viewership, to meet the needs of the communities in which we serve, and to meet the needs of our advertising customers.  In pursuit of this strategy, we seek to develop original programming or obtain, at attractive prices, popular syndicated programming that is complementary to each station’s network programming. We also seek to broadcast live local and national sporting events that would appeal to a large segment of the local community.  See Popular Sporting Events below for further discussion.  Moreover, we produce local news at 129 stations in 84 markets, including 3 stations which have a local news sharing agreement with a competitive station in that market.  See News below for further discussion.
Television advertising prices are based on ratings information measured and distributed by Nielsen and comScore. Nielsen is currently not accredited by the Media Rating Council, an independent organization that monitors rating services, which revoked Nielsen’s accreditation in the 154 markets in which Nielsen measures ratings exclusively by its diary methodology.  As of December 31, 2017, approximately 50 of our 89 markets are diary only markets.  comScore is an alternative rating service provider that uses set-top box television measurements to provide us additional measurement information to the ratings services that Nielsen provides for all 191 of our stations in our 89 markets.

News.  We believe that the production and broadcasting of local news is an important link to the community and an aid to a station’s efforts to expand its viewership. In addition, local news programming can provide access to advertising sources targeted specifically to local news viewers. Our news stations also produce content on digital platforms such as websites, mobile applications, and social media.
During 2017, we expanded news in 8 markets and plan to add additional newscasts in 3 markets in 2018.  During the year ended December 31, 2017, 31% of our net time sales were earned during the local news we produce each week. 

Our local news initiatives are an important part of our strategy. We have entered into local news sharing arrangements in which we receive news in 20 markets from other in-market broadcasters and provide news in 3 markets to other in-market broadcasters. We believe that, in the markets where we have news share arrangements, such arrangements generally provide both higher viewer ratings and revenues for the station receiving the news and generate a profit for the news share provider. Generally, both parties and the local community are beneficiaries of these arrangements.

In addition to our traditional local news stories, we have utilized our national reach and placement in the nation's capital to provide our local viewers with broader national news stories which are relevant to our local viewers.
Our local news coverage is complemented with airing Full Measure. Additionally, our national news desk and Capitol Hill bureau news teams produce daily unique stories unavailable from other sources and focused on government accountability storytelling that provides a significant point of difference for our stations. Available on-air and online, the bureau not only expands our news presence, but gives our local station viewers an opportunity to hear the views of their members of Congress through programs such as "Connect to Congress," our weekly on-air and digital feature which provides an electronic video pathway for lawmakers to speak to their constituents. 
During 2017, we created a national investigative news unit consisting of more than 50 reporters, which we plan to grow, to provide in-depth stories not covered elsewhere. 
We also provide our viewers with "Town Halls," which brings together our viewers to discuss major local and national topics. During 2017 we produced "Town Halls" covering political debates and discussions about a wide range of topics including education, sex trafficking, opioids, and gun laws. During 2018, we expect to produce over 120 hours of such coverage.
In 2016 we launched Circa, a national online digital news operation aimed at the Millennial demographic which both leverages and adds to our local and national news coverage. Also, in 2017, we acquired NewsOn, a single app to watch live, local news on mobile and OTT devices. See Expansion of Digital and Internet below for further discussion of these businesses.
11

Popular Sporting Events.  At some of our stations, we have been able to acquire local television broadcast rights for certain sporting events, including NBA basketball, MLB baseball, NFL football, NHL hockey, ACC basketball, both Big Ten and SEC football and basketball, and certain other college and high school sports. Our CW and MyNetworkTV stations generally face fewer preemption restrictions on broadcasting live local sporting events compared with our FOX, ABC, CBS, and NBC stations, which are required to broadcast a greater number of hours of programming supplied by the networks. In addition, our stations that are affiliated with FOX, ABC, CBS, and NBC have network arrangements to broadcast certain NBA basketball games, MLB baseball games, NFL football games, NHL hockey games, NASCAR races, and PGA golf events, as well as other popular sporting events. Tennis has telecast rights to the U.S. Open, Wimbledon, Roland Garros (French Open), Australian Open, ATP World Tour Masters 1000, 500, and 250 events, WTA Premier events, Laver Cup, Davis Cup, Fed Cup, Hopman Cup, World Team Tennis, and College and Junior events and exhibitions. Our stations also broadcast programming and other content provided by Tennis. Also, we provide access to certain events through our premium OTT offering, Tennis Channel Plus. See Development of Original Networks and Content below for a discussion related to the operating strategy of Tennis.
Control of Operating and Programming Costs.  By employing a disciplined approach to managing programming acquisition and other costs, we have been able to achieve operating margins that we believe are very competitive within the television broadcast industry. We believe our national reach as of December 31, 2017 of approximately 39% of the country provides us with a strong position to negotiate with programming providers and, as a result, the opportunity to purchase high quality programming at more favorable prices. Moreover, we emphasize control of each of our station’s programming and operating costs through program-specific profit analysis, detailed budgeting, regionalization of staff, and detailed long-term planning models. We also control our programming cost by creating original high-quality programming that is distributed on our broadcast platform. This original programming includes our CHARGE!, TBD, Comet, and Stadium networks; and ROH, Full Measure, and KidsClick programs. 
Developing Local Franchises.  We believe the greatest opportunity for a sustainable and growing customer base lies within our local communities. Therefore, we have focused on developing a strong local sales force at each of our television stations, which is comprised of approximately 800 marketing consultants and 100 local sales managers company-wide. Excluding political advertising revenue, retransmission revenues, and other local revenues, 69.9% and 70.6% of our same station net time sales were local for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Market share survey results reflect that our stations' share of the local television advertising market increased to 24.7% in 2017 from 24.6% in 2016. Our goal is to grow our local revenues by increasing our market share, developing new business opportunities, and offering marketing solutions across our platforms. 
Attract and Retain High Quality Management.  We believe that much of our success is due to our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated managers at both the corporate and local station levels.  We provide a combination of base salary, long-term incentive compensation including equity awards and, where appropriate, cash bonus pay designed to be competitive with comparable employers in the television broadcast industry.  A significant portion of the compensation available to certain members of our senior management and our sales force is based on their achievement of certain performance goals. We also encourage station managers and employees to utilize our diverse station group to grow in their careers while remaining in the Sinclair family of stations via internal promotion and relocation.
Multi-Channel Broadcasting.  FCC rules allow broadcasters to transmit additional digital channels within the spectrum allocated to each FCC license holder. This provides viewers with additional programming alternatives at no additional cost to them. We may consider other alternative programming formats that we could air using our multi-channel digital spectrum space with the goal towards achieving higher profits and community service. As of December 31, 2017, we have 410 multi-channels in our digital spectrum.
Retransmission Consent Agreements.  We have retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs, vMVPDs, and OTT, such as cable, satellite, and telecommunications operators in our markets.  MVPDs compensate us for the right to retransmit our broadcast signals and owned networks.  Our successful negotiations with MVPDs have created agreements that produce meaningful sustainable revenue streams.
Improvement and Maintenance of Our Distribution Platforms.  We continue to improve and maintain a strong distribution platform that consists of our traditional broadcast network and our digital platforms. Our Acrodyne and Dielectric subsidiaries are leaders in servicing and manufacturing broadcast infrastructure. As a result, we maintain a strong infrastructure through which we provide high quality uninterrupted content on our broadcast stations. These subsidiaries are critical in both the repack of the broadcast spectrum and the buildout of the infrastructure behind the Advanced Television Systems Committee standard 3.0 (ATSC 3.0) for both our stations and other broadcasters. See Development of Next Generation Broadcast Platform below for further discussion related to ATSC 3.0.
Developing New Business.  We strive to develop new business models to complement or enhance our traditional television broadcast business.  We have developed new ways to sell online, mobile text messaging, and social media advertising along with

our traditional commercial broadcasting model.  Additionally, we continue to leverage our national reach to provide new high quality content to our local communities.
In 2017, we entered into a agreement with Sorenson Media Group (Sorenson) to sell addressable advertising via smart TVs. Also, through our Audience Network business, we have been gained greater access to agencies buying network time. 
We continue to expand our digital distribution platforms through initiatives such as our new video management system, which simplifies and automates our broadcast-to-digital streaming workflow and allows for dynamic replacement of broadcast ads with digital ads targeted to each individual viewer. By using a single ad-serving system across all of our web sites, mobile apps, and other digital assets, we are able to streamline our sales workflow, optimize yield, and deliver comprehensive sales opportunities across our digital footprint. Additionally, we are deploying over-the-top initiatives (OTT), such as the NewsOn app, as well as our own content applications. 
Strategic Realignment of Station Portfolio.  We routinely review and conduct investigations of potential television station acquisitions, dispositions, and station swaps.  At any given time, we may be in discussions with one or more television station owners. See Note 2. Acquisitions and Dispositions of Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on completed and pending acquisitions.
Development of Original Networks and Content. In March 2016, we acquired Tennis. Unlike fully distributed cable networks that are in a declining business, Tennis, with its live tournaments and matches, passionate fan base, and established brand, was under-distributed. With our relationships with the multi-video program distributors (MVPDs) and the attractiveness of Tennis’ following, we have negotiated significant increases in carriage with MVPDs, with more penetration expected. Among the many benefits of the expanded carriage and pairing their content with our broadcast promotional capabilities, are additional MVPD subscriber fees, viewers, and advertising revenues. In March 2017, we acquired Tennis Magazine, the sport’s largest print publication, and Tennis.com, the most visited online tennis platform in the world. These acquisitions compliment Tennis and will allow us to provide greater and more in depth tennis content to consumers on tv, internet, and print.
In October 2015, we led the market in launching the first-ever science fiction multicast network, Comet, featuring over 1,500 hours of premium MGM content and already reaching approximately 70 million households, with more coverage expected. 
In February 2017, we launched CHARGE!, a 24/7 adventure and action-based network in partnership with MGM that features more than 2,300 hours of TV series content and more than 2,000 movie titles. CHARGE!'s reach is in excess of 50% of the country by way of distribution deals outside of Sinclair's footprint.
In February 2017, we launched TBD, the first multiscreen TV network in the U.S. market to bring premium internet-first content to TV homes across America. TBD includes web series, short films, fashion, comedy, lifestyle, eSports, music, and viral content through partnerships with creators such as Nerdist, Geek and Sundry, The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, Filmhub, Fail Army, and Fine Brothers.
In July 2017, we launched KidsClick, a national multiplatform programming block geared for children, and features robust and age-appropriate content available on all screens, including broadcast television, online, pay TV, mobile, and OTT.
During 2017, we transformed our American Sports Network (ASN) into a new digital network, Stadium, that brings together professional sports highlights and college games. 
Expansion of Digital and Internet. In July 2016, we launched Circa, a national online digital news operation aimed at the Millennial demographic. The site is focused on issues trending from around the country, delivered in an independent-minded style, with a heavy focus on short form video optimized for mobile and social media engagement. In addition to its unique stories, news talent, and creativity, Circa has the added benefit of capitalizing on our broadcast branding and promotional platform to drive viewing impressions, an opportunity not available to other online news providers. Circa also leverages the strength of Sinclair’s local newsrooms to cover live breaking and evolving stories as they unfold. Our goal is for every piece of content to organically capture the compelling personalities and moments that make it news and empower the consumer to then engage, share, and drill deeper into that storyline through video, audio, photos and our interactive tools. 
We have leveraged our digital expertise by launching Compulse, through which we run effective, integrated, and multi-platform digital marketing programs that drive loyalty, engage consumers, and help businesses achieve their goals. 
13

In 2017, we acquired DataSphere Technologies, a telesales operation that complements Compulse. Datasphere offers an integrated suite of products and platforms for automated creation of professional websites, videos, and landing pages for clients. Also 2017, we acquired NewsON a single app to watch live, local news on mobile and OTT devices. NewsON has 15 affiliate partners reaching over 80% of the country. 
 These innovative products and extensions of our core broadcast business allow us to compete for digital, internet, network, and print impressions and revenues. We continue to seek additional opportunities to invest in emerging digital technologies, ad tech, and digital content companies that support and expand Sinclair's digital capabilities and non-linear footprint. 
Development of Next Generation Broadcast Platform. In 2017, the FCC approved ATSC 3.0, a next generation broadcast platform (NextGen). NextGen is an enhancement to the previous broadcast standard due to its mobility, addressability, capacity, IP connectivity, and conditional access. NextGen merges linear and non-TV data services alongside over-the-air and over-the-top, allowing a mature broadcast industry to reinvent itself. Among the many emerging opportunities are hyper-local news, weather, and traffic; dynamic ad insertion; geographic and demographic targeted advertising; customizable content; better measurement and analytics; the ability to talk to devices connected to the Internet; flexibility to add streams as needed; an ultra-high definition picture quality with enhanced immersive audio; and connectivity to automobiles. In addition, NextGen provides new emergency capabilities including advanced alerting functions which can provide evacuation routes and device wake-up features. All of these features will be available to mobile devices, allowing us to reach viewers wherever they are - including younger audiences that are tied to their mobile screens. 
NextGen will allow us to use our spectrum for more than just video-formatted data as we do today. As a data-agnostic IP pipe, we also will be able to distribute text, audio and software. While our one-to-many architecture will remain a strength, we will be able to deliver “the last mile” across a more robust system, as well as connect legacy ATSC 1.0 televisions to NextGen using hot spots and wi-fi functionality. 
In 2017, we and other broadcasters formed the Spectrum Co, a joint venture that links local consortium member television stations to form a nationwide network to deliver national services and create a robust video and data exchange. The focus is to advance the promotion of spectrum efficiency, innovation and monetization in NextGen's multi-platform environment. Among the business possibilities are skinny bundles; connected car functionality including 3D mapping, telematics and infotainment; data wholesale models; and content delivery networks. 
In early 2018, we will construct and operate single frequency network (SFN) sites to broadcast ATSC 3.0 signals within the Dallas DMA. The SFN will allow for the testing, validation and deployment of advanced next generation broadcast services, which will provide many benefits to consumers, including those already mentioned above.
We continue to work with other NextGen stakeholders to build and test the single frequency network tower infrastructure, develop systems to allow the convergence of NextGen and 5G data delivery, and design NextGen receiver chips for mobile devices. We expect the implementation and adoption of NextGen to occur over the next three years alongside the government’s broadcast spectrum repack. When completed, the country will have a lower-cost, world class wireless IP data distribution network capable of supporting multiple business models. 
Other Non-media Investments.  We have sought ways to diversify our business and return additional value to our shareholders through investments in non-media based businesses and real estate. We carry investments in various companies from different industries, including: a sign design and fabrication company; various real estate ventures in developmental land, operating commercial and multi-family residential real estate properties and apartments; an investment in sustainable energy producing facilities; and investments in private equity and structured debt / mezzanine financing investment funds. Currently, operating results from our investments represent a small portion of our overall operating results. 
FEDERAL REGULATION OF TELEVISION BROADCASTING
The ownership, operation, and sale of television stations are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC, which acts under the authority granted by the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act).  Among other things, the FCC assigns frequency bands for broadcasting; determines the particular frequencies, locations, and operating power of stations; issues, renews, revokes, and modifies station licenses; regulates equipment used by stations; adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operation, and employment practices of stations; and has the power to impose penalties for violations of its rules and regulations of the Communications Act.
14

The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and specific FCC regulations and policies.  Reference should be made to the Communications Act, FCC rules, and the public notices and rulings of the FCC for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast stations.
License Grant and Renewal
Television stations operate pursuant to broadcasting licenses that are granted by the FCC for maximum terms of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the FCC.  During certain periods when renewal applications are pending, petitions to deny license renewals can be filed by interested parties, including members of the public.
Although historically renewal of a license, including those of the Company, is granted in the vast majority of cases, even when petitions to deny are filed, there can be no assurance that the license of any station will be renewed or, if renewed, that the renewal terms will be for the maximum term permitted.
All of our stations' most recent license renewal applications have been granted for the maximum term permitted. The next television license renewal application cycle will begin on June 1, 2020.
Ownership Matters
General.  The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a broadcast license without the prior approval of the FCC.  In determining whether to permit the assignment or transfer of control of, or the grant or renewal of, a broadcast license, the FCC considers a number of factors pertaining to the licensee, including compliance with various rules limiting common ownership of media properties, the “character” of the licensee and those persons holding “attributable” interests in that licensee and compliance with the Communications Act’s limitations on foreign ownership.  The FCC has indicated that in order to approve an assignment or transfer of a broadcast license the FCC must make an affirmative determination that the proposed transaction serves the public interest, not merely that the transaction does not violate its rules or shares factual elements with other transactions previously approved by the FCC, and that it may deny a transaction if it determines that the transaction would not be in the public interest.
The FCC generally applies its ownership limits to “attributable” interests held by an individual, corporation, partnership or other association.  In the case of corporations holding, or through subsidiaries controlling, broadcast licenses, the interests of officers, directors and those who, directly or indirectly, have the right to vote 5% or more of the corporation’s stock (or 20% or more of such stock in the case of insurance companies, investment companies and bank trust departments that are passive investors) are generally attributable.  In addition, pursuant to what is known as the equity-debt-plus rule, a major programming supplier or same-market media entity will be an attributable owner of a station if the supplier or same-market media entity holds debt or equity, or both, in the station that is greater than 33% of the value of the station’s total debt plus equity.  Further, the Communications Act generally prohibits foreign parties from having more than a 20% interest (voting or equity) in a broadcast licensee or more than a 25% interest in the parent of that licensee. Following a Declaratory Ruling in 2013 in which the Commission indicated that it was open to considering proposals for foreign investment in broadcast licenses that exceed the 25% benchmark on a case by case basis, on September 29, 2016, the FCC adopted a Report and Order which among other things, (i) simplified the foreign ownership approval process for broadcast licensees seeking to exceed the 25% benchmark and (ii) modified the methodology a licensee may use to determine compliance with the foreign ownership rules.
Sinclair and its subsidiaries are domestic corporations, and the members of the Smith family (who, as of December 31, 2017, together hold approximately 74.9% of the common voting rights of Sinclair) are all United States citizens.  Our amended and restated Articles of Incorporation (the Amended Certificate) contain limitations on alien ownership and control that are substantially similar to those contained in the Communications Act.  Pursuant to the Amended Certificate, we have the right to repurchase alien-owned shares at their fair market value to the extent necessary, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, to comply with the alien ownership restrictions.
Additional ownership rules as currently in effect are as follows:
Radio / Television Cross-Ownership Rule and Newspaper / Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule.  Until recently, the FCC’s rules (i) limited the combined number of television and radio stations a party could own in a market to up to two television stations and six radio stations, depending on the number of independent media voices in the market, and (ii) prohibited the common ownership of a radio or television broadcast station and a daily newspaper in the same market.  On November 20, 2017, the FCC released an Order on Reconsideration (Ownership Order on Reconsideration) that, among other changes, eliminated the Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule and the Newspaper/Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule. The rule changes adopted in the Ownership on Reconsideration became effective on February 7, 2018. A Petition for Review of the Ownership Order on Reconsideration was 
15

filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and Sinclair filed to intervene in the proceeding. On February 7, 2018, the Court denied, among other things, Petitioners’ request to stay the effective date of the Ownership Order on Reconsideration and instead issued a stay of the appeal for a period of 6 months. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.  We do not currently own any daily newspapers. 
National Ownership Rule.  The national television viewing audience reach cap is 39%.  Under this rule, where an individual or entity has an attributable interest in more than one television station in a market, the percentage of the national television viewing audience encompassed within that market is only counted once.  Additionally, because VHF stations (channels 2 through 13) historically covered a larger portion of the market than UHF stations (channels 14 through 51), only half of the households in the market area of any UHF station are included when calculating an entity’s national television viewing audience (commonly referred to as the UHF discount). On September 6, 2016, the FCC released a Report and Order eliminating the UHF discount (the “UHF Discount Order”), and on April 21, 2017, the Commission released an Order on Reconsideration (the “UHF Discount Order on Reconsideration”) to reinstate the UHF discount pending a future rulemaking to examine the UHF discount together with the national audience reach cap. The UHF discount was reinstated on June 15, 2017 and is currently in effect. The UHF Discount Order on Reconsideration is currently the subject of a Petition for Review filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. On December 18, 2017, the Commission released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to examine the national audience reach cap, including the UHF discount. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.
The majority of the stations we own and operate, or to which we provide programming services, are UHF.  With the UHF discount, our current reach (for FCC purposes) is approximately 25% of U.S. households.  With the pending Tribune Media Company (Tribune) transaction, absent divestitures, we would exceed the 39% cap, even with the application of the UHF discount. Changes to the national ownership cap could limit our ability to make television station acquisitions. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the risk related to the outcome of rules governing the UHF discount. See Note 2. Acquisitions and Dispositions of Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the Tribune acquisition.
Local Television (Duopoly) Rule.  A party may own television stations in adjoining markets, even if there is a digital noise limited service contour overlap between the two stations’ broadcast signals, and generally may own two stations in the same market only (i) if there is no digital overlap between the stations; or (ii) not more than one station is among the top-four rated stations in the market (the top-four rule). Until recently, the FCC did not allow a party to own more than one station in the same market if there was digital overlap between the stations unless the market containing both the stations would contain at least eight independently owned full-power television stations post-merger (the eight voices test). The Ownership Order on Reconsideration eliminated the eight voices test. The Ownership Order on Reconsideration also modified the top-four rule to permit parties to own up to two top-four rated stations in the same market on a case-by-case basis. Both rule changes became effective on February 7, 2018. A Petition for Review of the Ownership Order on Reconsideration, including the changes to the Local Television Rule, was filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and Sinclair filed to intervene in the proceeding. On February 7, 2018, the Court denied, among other things, Petitioners’ request to stay the effective date of the Ownership Order on Reconsideration and instead issued a stay of the appeal for a period of 6 months. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.
Local Marketing and Outsourcing Agreements
Certain of our stations have entered into agreements with other stations in the same market, through which we provide programming and operating services pursuant to time brokerage or local marketing agreements (LMAs) or provide sales services and other non-programming operating services pursuant to outsourcing agreements, such as joint sales agreements (JSAs) and shared services agreements (SSAs).  LMAs are attributable where a licensee holds an attributable interest in a television station and (i) programs more than 15% of the weekly broadcast hours and/or (ii) sells more than 15% of the weekly advertising time on another television station in the same market. LMAs existing prior to November 5, 1996 are currently grandfathered until further FCC action. Currently, all of our LMAs are grandfathered under the local television ownership rule because they were entered into prior to November 5, 1996. If the FCC were to eliminate the grandfathering of these LMAs, we would have to terminate or modify these LMAs.
In August 2016, the FCC completed both its 2010 and 2014 quadrennial reviews of its media ownership rules and issued an order (Ownership Order) which left most of the existing multiple ownership rules intact, but amended the rules to provide for the attribution of JSAs where two television stations are located in the same market, and a party with an attributable interest in one station sells more than 15% of the advertising time per week of the other station. JSAs existing as of March 31, 2014 were grandfathered until October 1, 2025, at which point they would have to be terminated, amended or otherwise come into compliance with the JSA attribution rule. The subsequent Ownership Order on Reconsideration released eliminated the JSA attribution rule. The rule changes adopted in the Ownership Order on Reconsideration became effective on February 7, 2018. A Petition for Review of the Ownership Order on Reconsideration, including the elimination of the JSA attribution rule, was filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Sinclair filed to intervene in the proceeding. On February 7, 2018, the Court denied, among other 
16

things, Petitioners’ request to stay the effective date of the Ownership Order on Reconsideration and instead issued a stay of the appeal for a period of 6 months. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.  If we are required to terminate or modify our LMAs or JSAs, our business could be adversely affected in several ways, including losses on investments and termination penalties. For more information on the risks, see Changes in rules on local marketing agreements under "The FCC’s multiple ownership rules may limit our ability to operate multiple television stations in some markets and may result in a reduction in our revenue or prevent us from reducing costs.  Changes in these rules may threaten our existing strategic approach to certain television markets." within Risk Factors and Changes in the Rules on Television Ownership under Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
In March 2014, the FCC issued a public notice on the processing of broadcast television applications proposing sharing arrangements and contingent interests.  The public notice indicated that the FCC will closely scrutinize any broadcast assignment or transfer application that proposes that two or more stations in the same market will enter into an agreement to share facilities, employees and/or services or to jointly acquire programming or sell advertising including through a JSA, LMA or similar agreement and enter into an option, right of first refusal, put /call arrangement or other similar contingent interest, or a loan guarantee. In February 2017, this guidance was rescinded by the FCC.
Antitrust Regulation.  The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission have increased their scrutiny of the television industry and have reviewed matters related to the concentration of ownership within markets (including LMAs and outsourcing agreements) even when ownership or the LMA or other outsourcing agreement in question is permitted under the laws administered by the FCC or by FCC rules and regulations.  The DOJ takes the position that an LMA or other outsourcing agreement entered into in anticipation of a station’s acquisition with the proposed buyer of the station constitutes a change in beneficial ownership of the station which, if subject to filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, cannot be implemented until the waiting period required by that statute has ended or been terminated.
Satellite Carriage
The Satellite Home Viewer Act (SHVA), as extended by The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 (SHVIA), the Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act (SHVERA), the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010 (STELA) and the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act Reauthorization (STELAR) among other things, (i) allows satellite carriers to provide local television signals by satellite within a station market, and to carry all local signals in any market where they carry any local signals, (ii) requires all television stations to elect to exercise certain “must-carry” or “retransmission consent” rights in connection with their carriage by satellite carriers, and (iii) authorizes satellite delivery of distant network signals, significantly viewed signals and local low-power television station signals into local markets under defined circumstances.
Must-Carry / Retransmission Consent
Television broadcasters are required to make triennial elections to exercise either certain “must-carry” or “retransmission consent” rights in connection with their carriage by cable systems in each broadcaster’s local market.   By electing to exercise must-carry rights, a broadcaster demands carriage and receives a specific channel on cable systems within its DMA. Must carry rights are not absolute and are dependent on a number of factors which may or may not be present in a particular case.  Alternatively, if a broadcaster chooses to exercise retransmission consent rights, it can prohibit cable systems from carrying its signal or grant the appropriate cable system the authority to retransmit the broadcast signal for a fee or other consideration.  We have elected to exercise our retransmission consent rights with respect to all of our stations. In February 2015, the FCC issued an order implementing certain statutorily required changes to its rules governing the duty to negotiate retransmission consent agreements in good faith. Under these rules, unless the stations are directly or indirectly under common de jure control as permitted under the regulations of the Commission, a station may not delegate authority to negotiate or approve a retransmission consent agreement to a station located in the same market or to a third party that negotiates together with another television station in the same market, nor may stations in the same market facilitate or agree to facilitate coordinated negotiation of retransmission consent terms for their stations in that market, including through the sharing of information.
Further, in September 2015, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in response to a Congressional directive in STELAR to examine the “totality of the circumstances test” for good-faith negotiations of retransmission consent. The proposed rulemaking sought comment on new factors and evidence to consider in its evaluation of claims of bad faith negotiation, including service interruptions prior to a “marquee sports or entertainment event,” restrictions on online access to broadcast programming during negotiation impasses, broadcasters’ ability to offer bundles of broadcast signals with other broadcast stations or cable networks, and broadcasters’ ability to invoke the FCC’s exclusivity rules during service interruptions. On July 14, 2016, the FCC's then-Chairman Wheeler announced that the FCC would not, at that time, proceed to adopt additional rules governing good faith negotiations of retransmission consent. No formal action has yet been taken on this Proposed Rulemaking, and we cannot predict if the full Commission will agree to terminate the Rulemaking without action.
17

Network Non-Duplication / Syndicated Exclusivity / Territorial Exclusivity
The FCC’s syndicated exclusivity rules allow local broadcast television stations to demand that cable operators black out syndicated non-network programming carried on “distant signals” (i.e., signals of broadcast stations, including so-called “superstations,” which serve areas substantially removed from the cable systems’ local community).  The FCC’s network non-duplication rules allow local broadcast, network affiliated stations to require that cable operators black out duplicate network programming carried on distant signals.  Both rules are subject to various exceptions and limitations.  In a number of markets in which we own or program stations affiliated with a network, a station that is affiliated with the same network in a nearby market is carried on cable systems in our markets.  Such significantly viewed signals are not subject to black out pursuant to the FCC’s network non-duplication rules.  The carriage of two network stations on the same cable system could result in a decline of viewership, adversely affecting the revenues of our owned or programmed stations.  In March 2014, the FCC issued a Report And Order And Further Notice Of Proposed Rulemaking, requesting comments on whether it has authority to, and should, eliminate or modify its network non-duplication and/or syndicated exclusivity rules.  This proceeding is pending and we cannot predict when or how the FCC will resolve that rulemaking.
Digital Television
FCC rules provide that television broadcast licensees may use their digital television (DTV) channels for a wide variety of services such as HD television, multiple standard definition television programming, audio, data, and other types of communications, subject to the requirement that each broadcaster provide at least one free video channel equal in quality to the current technical standard and further subject to the requirement that broadcasters pay a fee of 5% of gross revenues from any DTV ancillary or supplementary service for which there is a subscription fee or for which the licensee receives a fee from a third party.
Programming and Operations
The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the “public interest.”  The FCC has relaxed or eliminated many of the more formalized procedures it had developed in the past to promote the broadcast of certain types of programming responsive to the needs of a station’s community of license.  FCC licensees continue to be required, however, to present programming that is responsive to the needs and interests of their communities and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness.  Complaints from viewers concerning a station’s programming may be considered by the FCC when it evaluates renewal applications of a licensee, although such complaints may be filed at any time and generally may be considered by the FCC at any time.  Stations also must pay regulatory and application fees and follow various rules promulgated under the Communications Act that regulate, among other things, political advertising, sponsorship identifications, obscene and indecent broadcasts, and technical operations, including limits on radio frequency radiation. In addition, television licensees have obligations to create and follow employment outreach programs, provide a minimum amount of programming for children, comply with rules relating to the emergency alert system (EAS), maintain an online public inspection file, and abide by regulations specifying requirements to provide closed captions for its programming. FCC licensees are, in general, responsible for the content of their broadcast programming, including that supplied by television networks.  Accordingly, there is a risk of being fined as a result of our broadcast programming, including network programming.
On October 24, 2017, the FCC approved the elimination of the main studio rule, which required each broadcast television, FM radio, and AM radio licensee to have a main studio staffed with at least two employees located in or near its station’s local community.  The elimination of the main studio rule became effective on January 8, 2018.
Pending Matters
Congress and the FCC have under consideration, and in the future may consider and adopt, new laws, regulations, and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, the operation, ownership, and profitability of our broadcast stations, result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenues for our broadcast stations, and affect our ability to acquire additional broadcast stations or finance such acquisitions.
On November 16, 2017, the FCC adopted a Report and Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking authorizing the voluntary deployment of ATSC 3.0 and adopting rules to afford broadcasters flexibility to deploy ATSC 3.0 based transmissions while minimizing impact on consumers and industry stakeholders and seeking comment on certain additional matters. The Report and Order will go into effect on March 5, except for certain rules that require approval from the Office and Management and Budget.  Once approved by OMB, the effective date of those rules will be published in the Federal Register. Comments on the issues raised by the proposed rulemaking were due to be filed by February 20, 2018; and replies are due to be filed by March 20, 2018. 
18

Other matters that could affect our broadcast properties include technological innovations and developments generally affecting competition in the mass communications industry, such as direct television broadcast satellite service, Class A television service, the continued establishment of wireless cable systems and low power television stations, digital television technologies, the internet and mobility, and portability of our broadcast signal to hand-held devices.
Congress authorized the FCC to conduct so-called “incentive auctions” to auction and re-purpose broadcast television spectrum for mobile broadband use. See Broadcast Incentive Auction under Note 2. Acquisitions and Dispositions of Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our participation, results, and post-auction process.
Other Considerations
The preceding summary is not a complete discussion of all provisions of the Communications Act or other congressional acts or of the regulations and policies of the FCC, or in some cases, the DOJ.  For further information, reference should be made to the Communications Act other congressional acts and regulations and public notices circulated from time to time by the FCC, or in some cases, the DOJ.  There are additional regulations and policies of the FCC and other federal agencies that govern political broadcasts, advertising, equal employment opportunity, and other matters affecting our business and operations.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

Prior to our ownership or operation of our facilities, substances or waste that are, or might be considered, hazardous under applicable environmental laws may have been generated, used, stored, or disposed of at certain of those facilities.  In addition, environmental conditions relating to the soil and groundwater at or under our facilities may be affected by the proximity of nearby properties that have generated, used, stored, or disposed of hazardous substances.  As a result, it is possible that we could become subject to environmental liabilities in the future in connection with these facilities under applicable environmental laws and regulations.  Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with such environmental requirements and have not in the past been required to incur significant costs in connection therewith, there can be no assurance that our costs to comply with such requirements will not increase in the future or that we will not become subject to new governmental regulations, including those pertaining to potential climate change legislation, that may impose additional restrictions or costs on us.  We presently believe that none of our properties have any condition that is likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations, or consolidated statements of cash flows.
COMPETITION

Our television stations compete for audience share and advertising revenue with other television stations in their respective DMAs, as well as with other advertising media such as MVPDs, cable networks, radio, newspapers, magazines, outdoor advertising, transit advertising, telecommunications providers, direct mail, and internet and other digital media, such as OTT.  Some competitors are part of larger organizations with substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources than we have.  Other factors that are material to a television station’s competitive position include signal coverage, local program acceptance, network affiliation or program service, audience characteristics, and assigned broadcast frequency.

Competition in the television broadcasting industry occurs primarily in individual DMAs.  Generally, a television broadcasting station in one DMA does not compete with stations in other DMAs.  Our television stations are located in highly competitive DMAs.  MVPDs can increase competition for a broadcast television station by bringing into its market additional cable network channels.  These narrow cable network channels are typically low rated, and, as a result, advertisements are inexpensive to the local advertisers.  In addition, certain of our DMAs are overlapped by over-the-air station from adjacent DMAs and MVPDs of stations from other DMAs, which tends to spread viewership and advertising expenditures over a larger number of television stations.

Television stations compete for audience share primarily on the basis of program popularity, which has a direct effect on advertising rates.  Our network affiliated stations are largely dependent upon the performance of network provided programs in order to attract viewers.  Non-network time periods are programmed by the station primarily with syndicated programs purchased for cash, cash and barter, or barter-only, as well as through self-produced news, public affairs programs, live local sporting events, paid-programming, and other entertainment programming.

Television advertising rates are based upon factors which include the size of the DMA in which the station operates; a program’s popularity among the viewers that an advertiser wishes to attract; the number of advertisers competing for the available time; the demographic makeup of the DMA served by the station; the availability of alternative advertising media in the DMA; the aggressiveness and knowledge of the sales forces in the DMA to call on and understand their client’s need; and development of 
19

projects, features, and programs that tie advertiser messages to programming.  We believe that our sales and programming strategies allow us to compete effectively for advertising revenues within our DMAs.

The television broadcasting industry is continuously faced with technical changes and innovations, competing entertainment and communications media, changes in labor conditions, and governmental restrictions or actions of federal regulatory bodies, including the FCC, any of which could possibly have a material effect on a television station’s operations and profits. 

Moreover, technology advances and regulatory changes affecting programming delivery through fiber optic lines, video compression, and new wireless uses could lower entry barriers for new video channels and encourage the further development of increasingly specialized “niche” programming.  Telephone companies are permitted to provide video distribution services, on a common carrier basis, as “cable systems” or as “open video systems,” each pursuant to different regulatory schemes.  Additionally, over-the-top (OTT) services allows consumers to consume programming on-demand through access to the internet and without a subscription with an MVPD. We continue to compete with the OTT services for viewership.
DTV technology allows us to provide viewers multiple channels of digital television over each of our existing standard digital channels, to provide certain programming in HD television format and to deliver other channels of information in the forms of data and programming to the internet, PCs, smart phones, tablet computers and mobile devices.  These additional capabilities may provide us with additional sources of revenue, as well as additional competition.
We also compete for programming which involves negotiating with national program distributors or syndicators that sell first-run and rerun packages of programming.  Our stations compete for access to those programs against in-market broadcast station competitors for syndicated products and with national cable networks.  Public broadcasting stations generally compete with commercial broadcasters for viewers, but not for advertising dollars.

We believe we compete favorably against other television stations because of our management skill and experience, our ability historically to generate revenue share greater than our audience share, our network affiliations and program service arrangements, and our local program acceptance.  In addition, we believe that we benefit from the operation of multiple broadcast properties, affording us certain non-quantifiable economies of scale and competitive advantages in the purchase of programming.
