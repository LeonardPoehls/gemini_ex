ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Corporate History
 
The Company was originally formed on November 1, 2005 when Bio-Solutions International, Inc. (“Bio-Solutions”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with OmniMed Acquisition Corp., a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bio-Solutions, OmniMed International, Inc. (“OmniMed”) and the shareholders of OmniMed. Pursuant to the agreement, Bio-Solutions acquired all of the outstanding equity stock from the OmniMed shareholders. As a result, the OmniMed shareholders assumed control of Bio-Solutions and changed the name of the Company to OmniMed International, Inc., effective November 21, 2006. On January 17, 2006, OmniMed changed its name to MedeFile International, Inc. The Company’s business following the closing of this acquisition was the sale of an Internet-enabled Personal Health Record (iPHR) system for gathering, digitizing, maintaining, accessing and sharing an individual’s medical records, and in connection therewith, providing a professional service specializing in HIPAA compliant retrieval, reproduction and release of information. Under this service, Company personnel go onsite to physicians’ office weekly to reproduce the records requested by third parties.
 
On October 25, 2017, the Company the Company changed its name to Tech Town Holdings Inc, effective November 2, 2017.
 
The name change to Tech Town Holdings, Inc. was intended to reflect a new business strategy centered on identifying and fostering new or early stage business opportunities being aggressively fueled by digital reinvention and innovation. To that end, our business-building platform was segmented into six focused categories, for which we planned to advance numerous technology development projects:
 

● | Digital News Aggregation
--+-------------------------


● | Digital Entertainment and Gaming 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Digital Health and Wellness
--+----------------------------


● | CannaTech
--+----------


● | Mobile App Design and Development
--+----------------------------------

However, following closer scrutiny of the new business opportunities we were exploring in late 2017, coupled with our evaluation of market trends and growth dynamics in their respective categories, we determined that a more prudent strategy was to narrow our focus, working instead on capitalizing on global growth opportunities in a single industry category. At this time, we continue to evaluate prevailing opportunities for our Company and anticipate determining a focused course of action in mid-2018. In January 2018, the Company’s name was changed to Hash Labs Inc We also continue to provide a professional service specializing in HIPAA compliant retrieval, reproduction and release of information which is the primary source of revenue for the Company.


Plan of Operations
 
As of the date of this annual report, our Company has not entered into any definitive agreement with any party regarding any specific business opportunities for our Company. In our efforts to analyze business opportunities, we will consider the following factors:

● | Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Other relevant factors.
--+------------------------

 
We will need to raise funds for our operating and investing cash needs. We have no committed sources of capital and there is no assurance we will be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all. During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring costs related to developing our new business, filing of Exchange Act reports and other costs associated with being a public company. Although we believe we will be able to meet these costs through funds to be loaned by or invested in us by our stockholders or other investors, we can provide no assurance such funds will be available to us.
 
Employees
 
As of May 10, 2018, we have two full-time employees.
