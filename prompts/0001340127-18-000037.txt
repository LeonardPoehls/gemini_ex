ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
Carbonite, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "Carbonite", the "Company", "our", "we", or "us") provides backup, disaster recovery, high availability and workload migration technology (the "Carbonite Data Protection Platform"). The Carbonite Data Protection Platform supports businesses in locations around the world with secure and scalable global cloud infrastructure. We continue to invest in strategic acquisitions and integrate these acquisitions into our portfolio of data protection solutions, in order to expand our addressable market and increase our strategic importance to customers.
We were incorporated on February 10, 2005 as a Delaware corporation and our principal executive offices are located at Two Avenue de Lafayette, Boston, Massachusetts, 02111. We founded Carbonite on one simple idea: all computers need to be backed up, and in our always-connected and highly mobile world, cloud backup is the ideal approach.
On January 31, 2017, we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding capital stock of DoubleTake Software, Inc. for a purchase price of $65.9 million. In addition, on August 14, 2017, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Datacastle Corporation for a purchase price of $9.6 million pursuant to which we acquired all the assets associated with Datacastle's cloud data backup, caching and analytics software and services for data protection purposes. As discussed below, we recently entered into an agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Mozy, Inc., a cloud backup service for businesses and consumers, and certain related business assets owned by EMC Corporation or its affiliates, for a purchase price of $145.8 million. We believe these acquisitions strengthen our overall leadership position in the data protection market and strengthen our technology portfolio.
We derive the majority of our revenue from subscription fees and our consistently strong retention rates and scalable infrastructure help to support our growth. The remainder of our revenue is derived from software arrangements, which often contain multiple revenue elements, such as software licenses, hardware, professional services and post-contract customer support. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we generated revenue of $239.5 million, $207.0 million, and $136.6 million, respectively. We continue to invest in customer acquisition because the market for our solutions is highly

competitive and, as a result, our bookings have grown from $116.0 million in 2013 to $245.9 million in 2017. For a reconciliation of bookings to revenue for the last five years, see “Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data.”
Industry Trends
Trends on several fronts are fueling growth opportunities for Carbonite.
The first trend is the continued evolution of the data protection industry, along with the explosion in the creation of new data, which has driven customers to seek flexible and powerful cloud-based solutions that deliver high value. To protect new types of data and modernize their IT environments, businesses are shifting to the cloud. Analyst firm Gartner predicts that by 2020, the number of enterprises using the cloud as a backup target will double, up from 10% at the beginning of 2017.1 Carbonite’s efficient cloud infrastructure fuels a variety of data protection models - from backup, to high availability to migration - in the right deployment models - from cloud, to onsite, to hybrid - to meet the needs of our customers. 
The second trend is threats to data. The number of cyberattacks known as “Ransomware” has grown rapidly in recent years. The FBI defines ransomware as a type of malware installed on a computer or server that encrypts the files, making them inaccessible until a specified ransom is paid.2
The FBI reported that ransomware “skyrocketed” last year, costing businesses $1 billion during 2016.3 According to Cybersecurity Ventures, global ransomware damage costs are expected to exceed $5 billion by the end of 2017, up from $325 million in 2015.4 In order to avoid bad press and reputational damage, many ransomware incidents are not reported. According to new research from Bitdefender, ransomware payments in 2017 will hit a record $2 billion.5
In September 2016, the FBI issued a public service announcement stressing the importance of regular data backups and verification of the integrity of those backups as a defense to ransomware, stating that “backups are critical in ransomware incidents,” and “backups may be the best way to recover your critical data.”3 Additionally, Research and Markets expects the ransomware protection market to grow from $8.16 billion in 2016 to $17.36 billion by 2021.6 We expect this trend to drive adoption of backup solutions as businesses and individuals look for solutions to protect their data to avoid falling prey to criminals.
Finally, the industry analyst firm Gartner estimates the DRaaS market is expected to reach $3.7 billion by 2021.7 According to Gartner, mid-market drivers for DRaaS include improved affordability and functionality.
We believe data growth and data threats will continue to drive the need for data protection and that our solutions position us well to capitalize on this growth opportunity.

For solutions that utilize our cloud environments, we encrypt files using a secure key before the files leave the customers' computer and transmit the encrypted files over the internet to secure data centers. Customers’ files then remain encrypted on our servers to guard against unauthorized access. We employ outside security analysis firms, including anti-hacking specialists, to review and test our defenses and internal procedures.
Comprehensive customer support: We believe that our customer support is more comprehensive than that offered by our primary competitors in the cloud backup market and aids in our customer retention. Telephone, live chat, and email customer support are included in our subscription fee.

Marketing and Sales
Our marketing and sales efforts are focused on three primary goals: acquiring customers at a low cost, retaining existing customers, and building brand awareness. Our advertising reinforces our brand by emphasizing ease of use, affordability, security and reliability. We use radio advertising, online display advertising, print advertising, paid search, direct marketing, and affiliate and reseller marketing. Our public relations efforts include engaging the traditional press, new media, industry influencers and social networks. Our sales model is designed to sell large volumes of our solutions to businesses globally, both directly and through our indirect network of channel partners which includes distributors, value-added resellers, managed service providers and global systems integrators.
Marketing. Our customers come from two primary sources: businesses who buy our solutions directly from our website, our inside sales team, or from our network of partners, and consumers who sign up for solutions on our website in response to our direct marketing campaigns. We support our sales network with a marketing approach that leverages our established brand to drive market awareness and demand generation among the broad population of businesses and consumers. Our marketing

efforts are designed to attract prospective customers and enroll them as paying customers, either through immediate sale, free trials or communication of the benefits of our solutions and development of ongoing relationships.
Channel distribution. To further penetrate the extensive and diverse population of businesses, we have and will continue to invest in our network of sales channel partners. Our network of sales channel partners includes distributors, value-added resellers, managed service providers and global systems integrators and is designed to sell large volumes of our relatively low-priced solutions to customers.
Retention. Our retention efforts are focused on establishing and maintaining long-term relationships with our customers by delivering a compelling customer experience and superior value, communicating regularly with customers through email, on-site messaging, and other media, and creating positive interactions with our customer support team. We monitor developing trends in subscription durations, renewals, and customer satisfaction to maximize our customer retention. We offer incentives to customers to purchase multi-year subscriptions, which we believe helps to increase our retention. 
Intellectual Property
We believe the strength of our brand and the functionality of our software help differentiate us from our competitors. Our success therefore depends on our ability to protect our technologies and intellectual property, which allows us to move and store vast amounts of customer data. To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of trademark, patent, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions. Carbonite, the Carbonite Logo, MAILSTORE, DOUBLETAKE and EVAULT, as well as other marks, are registered trademarks of Carbonite, Inc. in numerous countries throughout the world. The Carbonite trademark is subject to registrations covering over 40 countries. Carbonite also has additional registrations and/or pending applications for additional marks in the U.S. and/or other countries, including but not limited to “Carbonite The Better Backup Plan”, “Back it up. Get it back”, “Because Your Life is On Your Computer” Logo, "Carbonite" and the Green Dot Logo, Carbonite Lock Logo, the Z logo and Chinese character representations for Carbonite. In addition, we have 67 issued patents and pending applications worldwide that cover both our technical infrastructure and our key usability and design concepts.
Competition
Our market is rapidly evolving due to technological advances that are driving changes in the way businesses operate. Over the past few years, competition has intensified, and we expect this to continue with market consolidation, the introduction of new technologies, and introduction of new market entrants. We compete against many companies across the data protection, disaster recovery, high availability and storage industries, ranging from those who provide a wide array of IT services, to those who provide only a specific business continuity product, to distributors and resellers. We expect many of our actual and potential competitors and solutions to change as we expand further into the business market and as the markets we compete in continue to evolve. 
We believe key factors to successfully compete in any of our markets include ease of installation and use, value, cloud storage, data security, reliability, and brand reputation. We believe that Carbonite competes favorably with respect to each of the key factors by providing powerful, yet simple solutions. Our offerings are easy-to-use, affordable, secure, include a variety of storage capacity options, and enable anytime, anywhere access to files.

The Agreement contains termination rights, including a right for either party to terminate the Agreement if the closing shall not have occurred on or before July 1, 2018, subject to certain conditions. We expect the acquisition to close during the first quarter of 2018.
