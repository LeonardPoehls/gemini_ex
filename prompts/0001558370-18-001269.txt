 Item 1.  Business
 Organization
 Jones Energy, Inc. was formed in March 2013 as a Delaware corporation to become a publicly-traded entity and the holding company of Jones Energy Holdings, LLC. As the sole managing member of JEH, the Company is responsible for all operational, management and administrative decisions relating to JEH’s business and consolidates the financial results of JEH and its subsidiaries.
 The Company’s certificate of incorporation authorizes two classes of common stock, Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The Class B common stock is held by the remaining owners of JEH prior to the initial public offering (“IPO”) of the Company (collectively, the “Class B shareholders”) and can be exchanged (together with a corresponding number of common units representing membership interests in JEH (“JEH Units”)) for shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications and other similar transactions. In addition, the Company’s certificate of incorporation also authorizes the Board of Directors of the Company to establish one or more series of preferred stock. On August 25, 2016, the Company issued 1,840,000 shares of its 8.0% Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series A preferred stock”), pursuant to a registered public offering, of which 1,839,995 remained isused and outstanding as of December 31, 2017.
 Jones Energy, Inc.’s Class A common stock has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “JONE” since July 2013. Neither the Class B common stock nor the Series A preferred stock is traded on a national securities exchange.
 Overview
 We are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in the mid-continent United States, spanning areas of Oklahoma and Texas. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jonny Jones, founded our predecessor company in 1988 in continuation of his family’s long history in the oil and gas business, which dates back to the 1920s. We have grown by leveraging our focus on low cost drilling and completion methods and our horizontal drilling expertise to develop our inventory and execute several strategic acquisitions. We have accumulated extensive knowledge and experience in developing the Anadarko Basin, having concentrated our operations there for over 25 years. We have drilled over 930 total wells as operator, including nearly 760 horizontal wells, since our formation. Our operations are focused on horizontal drilling within two distinct areas in Oklahoma and Texas:
· | the Eastern Anadarko Basin—targeting the liquids rich Woodford shale and Meramec formations in the Merge area of the STACK/SCOOP plays (the “Merge”); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Western Anadarko Basin—targeting the liquids rich Cleveland, Granite Wash, Tonkawa and Marmaton formations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We seek to optimize returns through a disciplined emphasis on controlling costs and promoting operational efficiencies, and we have historically been recognized as one of the lowest cost drilling and completion operators in the Cleveland formation. Our low-cost drilling expertise has applied directly to our newer operations in the Merge, where the Company plans to spend the majority of its 2018 capital budget.
 The Anadarko Basin is among the most prolific and largest onshore oil and natural gas basins in the United States, characterized by multiple producing horizons and extensive well control collected over 100 years of development. We leverage our extensive geologic experience in the basin and seek to identify the most profitable exploration and development opportunities to apply our operational expertise. The formations we target are generally characterized by oil and/or liquids‑rich natural gas content, extensive production histories, long‑lived reserves, high drilling success rates and attractive initial production rates. We focus on formations in our operating areas that we believe offer significant development potential and to which we can apply our technical experience and operational excellence to increase reserves, production and cash flows. Our goal is to build value through a disciplined balance between developing our current inventory of 7,180 gross (1,820 net) identified drilling locations, identifying new opportunities within our existing asset base, actively pursuing organic leasing, and acquisition opportunities.

      Our 2017 capital expenditures totaled $248.0 million (excluding the impact of asset retirement costs, asset disposals and non-cash impairments of oil and gas properties), of which $205.7 million was utilized to drill and complete operated wells. The Company has established an initial capital budget of $150.0 million for 2018, including $134.0 million for drilling and completing wells and $16.0 million for leasing, workovers and other capital projects. The initial budget for 2018 in the Merge is based on estimated ranges of well costs between $5.4 million and $6.1 million per well in the Meramec formation and estimated well costs between $5.5 million and $6.0 million in the Woodford formation. Please see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” 
 We expect to fund our 2018 budgeted capital expenditures with cash flow from operations and a portion of the net proceeds from our recent offering of 9.25% senior secured first lien notes due 2023 (the “2023 First Lien Notes”), as well as potential non-strategic asset sales or potentially accessing the debt and/or equity capital markets. In addition, we may, from time to time and subject to our assessment of market conditions, engage in liability management transactions in an effort to reduce indebtedness. Furthermore, we expect to develop all drilling locations classified as proved undeveloped reserves in the year‑end reserve report within five years of initial proved reserve booking. We consider projections of future commodity prices when determining our development plan, but many other factors are also considered. Should the commodity price environment or other material factors change significantly from current levels, we will re‑evaluate our development plan at that time. If the evaluation results in a shifting of capital expenditures into

future periods beyond five years from the initial proved reserve booking, it could potentially lead to a reduction in proved undeveloped reserves.
 We have allocated our 2018 capital expenditure budget as follows:

(in millions of dollars) | | 2018 Capital Expenditure Budget | 
Drilling and completion | | | | 
 | Eastern Anadarko, operated | | $ | 108.0
 | Eastern Anadarko, non-operated | | | 15.0 
 | Western Anadarko | | | 11.0

 Our Operations
 Our Area of Operations
 We own leasehold interests in oil and natural gas producing properties, as well as in undeveloped acreage, substantially all of which are located in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma and Texas. The majority of our interests are in producing properties located in fields characterized by what we believe to be long‑lived, predictable production profiles and repeatable development opportunities. Specifically, our properties and wells are located in fields that generally have been developed over a long period of time, typically decades. Given the long productive history of these fields, there is substantial midstream and service infrastructure in place, including natural gas and NGL pipelines and natural gas processing plants. Observing the performance of these fields over many years allows for greater understanding of production and reservoir characteristics, making future performance more predictable. For a discussion of the risks inherent in oil and natural gas production, please read “Risk Factors—Drilling for and producing oil, natural gas and NGLs are high‑risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.”
 Nearly 100% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 and approximately 84% of our average daily net production for the year ended December 31, 2017 were located in the Anadarko Basin. The Anadarko Basin is one of the most prolific oil and natural gas producing basins in the United States, covering approximately 50,000 square miles primarily in Oklahoma, but also including the upper Texas Panhandle, southwestern Kansas, and southeastern Colorado.
 The Anadarko Basin has an especially well developed interval of productive Pennsylvanian age sedimentary rocks, up to 15,000 feet thick. Our wells in this area produce oil, natural gas and NGLs from various formations at depths from approximately 7,000 feet to 12,000 feet. We drilled 70 gross (58 net) wells as operator in the Anadarko Basin during 2017. Our operations in the Western Anadarko Basin have been primarily focused on the Cleveland formation where we have 671 producing wells. We also have acreage in the Tonkawa, Marmaton, Granite Wash, and various Pennsylvanian‑age shale formations located in western Oklahoma and the eastern portion of the Texas Panhandle. Since 2016, we have also been focused on the Woodford and Meramec formations in the Eastern Anadarko Basin.
 Our production in the Anadarko Basin is currently derived primarily from the following formations, where we have 1,013 gross (585 net) producing wells and where we have identified 7,180 gross (1,820 net) drilling locations as of December 31, 2017, of which 348 have proved undeveloped reserves attributed to them as of December 31, 2017. See “Drilling Locations” for more information regarding the processes and criteria through which these drilling locations were identified.

 Western Anadarko Basin.   
· | Cleveland Formation. Our Cleveland acreage is primarily located in Ochiltree, Lipscomb, Hutchinson, and Hemphill Counties in Texas and Ellis County in Oklahoma. The Cleveland formation ranges from depths of approximately 7,000 feet to 8,800 feet and is characterized by a tight, shaly sand with low permeability that lends itself to improved recovery through enhanced drilling and completion techniques. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As of December 31, 2017, we had 671 gross (482 net) producing wells in the formation with an average working interest of 72%, of which we operated 492 gross (416 net) producing wells. Our Cleveland properties contained 70.4 MMBoe of estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2017, 60% of which are oil and NGLs, and generated an average daily net production of 15.2 MBoe/d for the year ended December 31, 2017. We have identified 630 gross (422 net) drilling locations in the Cleveland formation as of December 31, 2017. Of these 630 locations, 194 locations (31%) have proved undeveloped reserves attributed to them as of December 31, 2017.

· | Tonkawa Formation. As of December 31, 2017, we identified 279 gross (168 net) drilling locations in the Tonkawa formation primarily in Lipscomb and Hemphill Counties in Texas. In addition, the Tonkawa formation is present in the area of other properties we own located primarily in Ellis and Roger Mills Counties in Oklahoma. The Tonkawa is a horizontal oil formation at depths of approximately 6,000 feet to 8,000 feet and is characterized by fine to very fine‑grained shallow marine sandstone, ranging in thickness from 20 feet to 40 feet. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We drilled our first horizontal Tonkawa well in May 2010 and drilled two additional horizontal wells in the formation under a farm‑out with Samson Resources that is not part of our current leasehold. During 2014, we drilled six additional test wells in different areas of the Company’s leasehold acreage in the Tonkawa formation. As of December 31, 2017, our Tonkawa properties contained 0.3 MMBoe of estimated net proved reserves.

· | Marmaton Formation. As of December 31, 2017, we identified 463 gross (278 net) drilling locations in the Marmaton formation. Our properties in the Marmaton formation are all undeveloped and span three sub‑ formations: properties located primarily in Ellis County, Oklahoma characterized by fluvio‑deltaic sands, properties located primarily in Northeast Ochiltree and Northwest Lipscomb Counties, Texas, characterized by shallow marine sands, and properties located primarily in Ochiltree County, Texas characterized by algal reef complex. The Marmaton sand is a tight, shaly sand with similar reservoir characteristics to the Cleveland. The Marmaton sand ranges in thickness from 40 feet to 80 feet while the reef ranges from 80 feet to 150 feet. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Granite Wash Formation. Our Granite Wash acreage is primarily located in Roberts, Hemphill and Wheeler Counties in Texas and Roger Mills, Beckham, Custer and Washita Counties in Oklahoma. The Granite Wash spans multiple zones from depths of approximately 9,000 feet to 12,000 feet and is composed of stacked, low permeability, variable lithology alluvial fan deltaic deposits. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As of December 31, 2017, we had 75 gross (20 net) producing wells in the formation with an average working interest of 26%, of which we operated 23 gross (17 net) producing wells. Our Granite Wash properties contained 3.6 MMBoe of estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2017, approximately 48% of which are oil and NGLs. We have 362 gross (22 net) remaining drilling locations in the Granite Wash formation as of December 31, 2017.
 Eastern Anadarko Basin.   
· | Merge Woodford Formation. Our Merge Woodford acreage is located in Canadian, Grady and McClain Counties in Oklahoma. The Merge Woodford ranges in depths from approximately 8,500 feet to 13,000 feet and includes various fluids from black oil to gas/condensate. The Merge Woodford formation consists of siliceous, organic-rich shale, and thin bedded carbonates. The low permeability reservoir is naturally fractured with silica-rich brittle layers that are highly conducive to improved recovery from enhanced drilling and completion techniques. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our Merge Woodford properties contained 15.0 MMBoe of estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2017, approximately 63% of which are oil and NGLs, and generated an average daily net production of 2.8 MBoe/d for the year ended December 31, 2017. We have identified 3,280 gross (548 net) drilling locations in the Merge Woodford formation as of December 31, 2017. Of these 3,280 locations, 85 locations (3%) have proved undeveloped reserves attributed to them as of December 31, 2017.

· | Meramec Formation. Our Meramec acreage is located in Canadian, Grady and McClain Counties in Oklahoma. The Meramec is a horizontal liquid-rich reservoir that ranges in depths from approximately 8,000 feet to 12,500 feet. The reservoir includes various fluids from black oil to gas/condensate. The Meramec formation consist of siltstones, organic-rich shale, and limestones with gradations between rock types. Early results from laterals drilled in various landing points within the Meramec indicate the rock is highly conducive to improved recovery from enhanced drilling and completion techniques. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our Meramec properties contained 13.3 MMBoe of estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2017, approximately 65% of which are oil and NGLs. We have identified 2,163 gross (379 net) drilling locations in the Meramec formation as of December 31, 2017. Of these 2,163 locations, 33 locations (2%) have proved undeveloped reserves attributed to them as of December 31, 2017.
 Future Potential Opportunities. Our current leasehold position provides longer term potential exposure to other prospective formations in the Anadarko Basin, including the Atoka, Cherokee, Douglas, Cottage Grove, and Upper and Lower Morrow formations in the Western Anadarko, and the Hunton, Osage, Chester, Caney, and Springer formations in the Eastern Anadarko. The Atoka and Cherokee formations, in particular, have attractive geologic properties, and we may elect to pursue their development in the future.
 Arkoma Divestiture
 On August 1, 2017, JEH sold its Arkoma Basin properties (the “Arkoma Assets”) for a sale price of $65.0 million, prior to customary effective date adjustments of $7.3 million, and subject to customary post-close adjustments (the “Arkoma Divestiture”). JEH may also receive up to $2.5 million in contingent payments based on natural gas prices. No amounts have been recorded related to this contingent payment as of December 31, 2017. Drilling Locations
 We have identified a total of 7,180 gross (1,820 net) drilling locations on our acreage, all of which are horizontal drilling locations. Of these total identified locations, 2,451 gross locations are attributable to acreage that is currently held by existing production and approximately 348 (5%) are attributable to proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2017. In order to identify drilling locations, we apply geologic screening criteria based on the presence of a minimum threshold of reservoir thickness in a section and then consider the number of sections and the appropriate well density to develop the applicable field. In making these assessments, we include properties in which we hold operated and non‑operated interests, as well as redevelopment opportunities. Once we have identified acreage that is prospective for the targeted formations, well placement is determined primarily by the regulatory spacing rules prescribed by the governing body in each of our operating areas. Wells drilled in the Cleveland formation are developed ranging between 128 acre spacing (5 wells per section) and 213-acre spacing (3 wells per section). Wells drilled in the Merge Woodford formation and the Meramec formation are developed on 160‑acre spacing (4 wells per section). Wells drilled in the Granite Wash formation are developed on 128‑acre or 213‑acre spacing. Wells drilled in the Tonkawa and Marmaton formations are developed on 160‑acre spacing. We view the risk profiles for the Tonkawa and Marmaton formations as being higher than for our other drilling locations due to relatively less available production data and drilling history.
 Our identified drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled over many years. The ultimate timing of the drilling of these locations will be influenced by multiple factors, including oil, natural gas and NGL prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling, completion and production costs, the availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, gathering systems, processing, marketing and pipeline transportation constraints, regulatory approvals and other factors. In addition, a number of our identified drilling locations are associated with joint development agreements, and if we do not meet our obligation to drill the minimum number of wells specified in an agreement, we will lose the right to continue to develop certain acreage covered by that agreement. For a discussion of the risks associated with our drilling program, see “Risk Factors—Our identified drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled over many years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling, which in certain instances could prevent or delay associated expected production. In addition, we may not be 

 
  7

 
able to raise the amount of capital that would be necessary to drill a substantial portion of our identified drilling locations.”
 Estimated Proved Reserves
 The following table sets forth summary data with respect to our estimated net proved oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, which are based upon reserve reports of Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc., (“Cawley Gillespie”), our independent reserve engineers. Cawley Gillespie’s reports were prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding oil and natural gas reserve reporting in effect during such periods.

 The following table sets forth the benchmark prices used to determine our estimated proved reserves for the periods indicated.

 | As of December 31, | 
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 
Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Benchmark Prices: | | | | | | | 
Oil (per Bbl) (1) | $ | 51.34 | | $ | 42.75 | $ | 50.25
Natural gas (per MMBtu) (2) | | 2.96 | | | 2.46 | | 2.59 
NGLs (per Bbl) (3) | | 18.92 | | | 17.73 | | 17.63


(1) | Benchmark prices for oil reflect the unweighted arithmetic average first‑day‑of‑the‑month prices for the prior 12 months using WTI Cushing posted prices. These prices were utilized in the reserve reports prepared by Cawley Gillespie and in management’s internal estimates and are adjusted by well for content, quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead. As of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the average realized prices for oil were $47.45, $38.80 and $45.97 per Bbl, respectively.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Benchmark prices for natural gas in the table above reflect the unweighted arithmetic average first‑day‑of‑the‑month prices for the prior 12 months, respectively, using Henry Hub prices. These prices were utilized in the reserve reports prepared by Cawley Gillespie and in management’s internal estimates and are adjusted by well for content, quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead. As of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the average realized prices for natural gas were $2.10, $2.19 and $2.37 per MMBtu, respectively.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Prices for NGLs in the table above reflect the average realized prices for the prior 12 months assuming ethane is recovered from the natural gas stream. Benchmark prices for NGLs vary depending on the composition of the NGL basket and current prices for the various components thereof, such as butane, ethane, and propane, among others. Due to declines in ethane prices relative to natural gas prices, beginning in 2012 through the Arkoma Divestiture, purchasers of our Arkoma Woodford production were electing not to recover ethane from the natural gas stream and instead were paying us based on the natural gas price for the ethane left in the gas stream. As a result of the increased energy content associated with the returned ethane and the absence of plant shrinkage, this ethane rejection increased the incremental revenue and volumes that we received for our natural gas product relative to what we would have received if the ethane was separately recovered, but reduced physical barrels of liquid ethane that we sold.

  Reserves Sensitivities
 Assuming NYMEX strip pricing as of February 21, 2018 through 2022 and keeping pricing flat thereafter, instead of 2017 SEC pricing, and leaving all other parameters unchanged, the Company’s proved reserves would have been 104.9 MMBoe. This alternative pricing scenario is provided only to demonstrate the impact that the current pricing environment may have on reserves volumes. There is no assurance that these prices will actually be realized. The amount of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 calculated using SEC pricing is lower than the amount of our proved reserves calculated using current market prices. Using SEC pricing of December 31, 2017, our total estimated proved reserves were 104.8 MMBoe.
 Reconciliation of PV‑10 to Standardized Measure
 PV‑10 is derived from the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. PV‑10 is a computation of the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows on a pre‑tax basis. PV‑10 is equal to the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows at the applicable date, before deducting future income taxes, discounted at 10 percent. We believe that the presentation of PV‑10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated net proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes, and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties. Further, investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our proved reserves to other companies. We use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas properties.

      Internal Controls
 Our proved reserves are estimated at the well or unit level and compiled for reporting purposes by our corporate reservoir engineering staff. We maintain internal evaluations of our reserves in a secure reserve engineering database. The corporate reservoir engineering staff interacts with our internal petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals in each of our operating areas and with operating, accounting and marketing employees to obtain the necessary data for the reserves estimation process. Reserves are reviewed and approved internally by our senior management team on a semi‑annual basis. We expect to have our reserve estimates evaluated by Cawley Gillespie, our independent third‑party reserve engineers, or another independent reserve engineering firm, at least annually.
 Our internal professional staff works closely with Cawley Gillespie to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data that is furnished to them for their reserve estimation process. We provide all of the reserve information maintained in our secure reserve engineering database to the external engineers, as well as other pertinent data, such as geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria. We make all requested information, as well as our pertinent personnel, available to the external engineers as part of their evaluation of our reserves. Various procedures are used to ensure the accuracy of the data provided to our independent petroleum engineers, including review processes. Changes in reserves from the previous report are closely monitored. Reconciliation of reserves from the previous report, which includes an explanation of all significant changes, is reviewed by both the engineering department and management, including our Executive Vice President of Geosciences and Business Development. Our independent petroleum engineers prepare our annual reserves estimates, whereas interim estimates are internally prepared.
 Technology Used to Establish Proved Reserves
 Under SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proven effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
 To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, our internal reserve engineers and Cawley Gillespie employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, geologic maps and available downhole and production data, seismic data and well test data. Reserves attributable to producing wells with sufficient production history were estimated using appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. Reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history and for undeveloped locations were estimated using performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area and geologic data to assess the reservoir continuity. These wells were considered to be analogous based on production performance from the same formation and well completion using similar techniques.

 Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves
 As of December 31, 2017, none of our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2017 were scheduled to be developed on a date more than five years from the date the reserves were initially booked as proved undeveloped. However, certain of our proved undeveloped reserves are associated with joint development agreements with third parties that include obligations to drill a specified minimum number of wells in a time frame that is shorter than five years. If we do not meet our obligation to drill the minimum number of wells specified in a joint development agreement, we will lose the right to continue to develop the undeveloped acreage covered by the agreement, which in some cases would result in a reduction in our proved undeveloped reserves. Historically, our drilling and development programs were substantially funded from our cash flow from operations and the capital markets. Our expectation is to continue to fund our drilling and development programs primarily from our cash flow from operations and cash on our balance sheet, as well as potential non-strategic asset sales or potentially accessing the public debt and/or equity markets. Based on our current expectations of our cash resources and drilling and development programs, which include drilling of proved undeveloped locations, we believe that we will be able to fund the drilling of our current inventory of proved undeveloped locations in the next five years. For a more detailed discussion of our liquidity position, please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

 We have nearly maintained the volume of our proved undeveloped reserves year-over-year, from 42.7 MMBoe as of December 31, 2016 to 42.6 MMBoe as of December 31, 2017. The slight reduction was due to (i) negative revisions of 7.3 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves rescheduled outside of five years from their initial booking due to reduced Western Anadarko drilling and (ii) net negative revisions of 3.4 MMBoe due to lease expirations. These were offset by increases due to (iii) additions of 3.4 MMBoe from increased working interest and (iv) additions of 1.2 MMBoe from increased pricing. Proved undeveloped reserves remained constant as a percentage of total reserves at 41% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Proved undeveloped reserves decreased as a percentage of total reserves from 42% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 41% for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 For the year ended December 31, 2017, we converted 6.2 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves or 15% of total proved undeveloped reserves booked at December 31, 2016. Our 2017 capital expenditures totaled $248.0 million (excluding the impact of asset retirement costs, asset disposals and non-cash impairments of oil and gas properties), of which $205.7 million was utilized to drill and complete operated wells, including wells that had no proved undeveloped reserves associated with them prior to drilling. The Company has established an initial capital budget of $150.0 million for 2018, with the majority dedicated to drilling and completion activities. Costs of proved undeveloped reserve development in 2017 do not represent the total costs of these conversions, as additional costs may have been incurred in previous years. Estimated future development costs relating to the development of 2017 year‑end proved undeveloped reserves is $400.0 million, all of which is scheduled to be incurred within five years of initial proved reserve booking. All drilling locations classified as proved undeveloped reserves in the year‑end reserve report are scheduled to be drilled within five years of initial proved reserve booking.

----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  For the three years ended December 31, 2017, we had one developmental or exploratory well that was deemed to be a dry well. As of December 31, 2017, there was one exploratory well drilled, but not yet completed. As of December 31, 2017, there were three development wells in the process of drilling and nine wells in the process of completions. For the three years ended December 31, 2017, we drilled 168 gross (147 net) wells as operator with over a 97% success rate.
 During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we successfully drilled 69 gross proved undeveloped wells and completed 65 gross proved undeveloped wells.
 Productive Wells
 The following table sets forth our total gross and net productive wells by oil or natural gas classification as of December 31, 2017.

 | Oil | Natural Gas | Total

  Gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we own an interest, and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells.
 Acreage Data
 The following table sets forth certain information regarding the developed and undeveloped acreage in which we have an interest as of December 31, 2017 for each of our producing areas. Acreage related to royalty, overriding royalty and 

 
  13

 
other similar interests is excluded from this summary. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 81% of our leasehold acreage was held by existing production.

 | Developed Acres | Undeveloped Acres | Total 
 | Gross | Net | Gross | Net | Gross | Net 
Western Anadarko | 184,798 | 129,859 | 29,964 | 22,332 | 214,762 | 152,191

      Undeveloped Acreage Expirations
 The following table sets forth the number of gross and net undeveloped acres as of December 31, 2017 that will expire over the next three years by operating area unless production is established within the spacing units covering the acreage prior to the expiration dates or unless the existing leases are renewed prior to expiration.
 | Expiring 2018 | Expiring 2019 | Expiring 2020 | Thereafter
 | Gross | Net | Gross | Net | Gross | Net | Gross | Net
Western Anadarko | 17,253 | 12,777 | 6,285 | 5,041 | 4,456 | 3,985 | 1,970 | 528
Eastern Anadarko | 35,396 | 6,715 | 45,636 | 5,363 | 14,061 | 1,742 | — | —

All properties | 52,649 | 19,492 | 52,238 | 10,411 | 18,517 | 5,727 | 1,970 | 528

      A majority of the leases comprising the acreage set forth in the table above will expire at the end of their respective primary terms unless operations have commenced or production from the acreage has been established prior to such date, in which event the lease will remain in effect until the cessation of operations or production in commercial quantities. We also have options to extend some of our leases through payment of additional lease bonus payments prior to the expiration of the primary term of the leases. In addition, we may attempt to secure a new lease upon the expiration of certain of our acreage; however, there may be third‑party leases that become effective immediately if our leases expire at the end of their respective terms and production has not been established prior to such date. We do not have any of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2017 attributed to acreage whose lease expiration date precedes the scheduled initial drilling date. Our leases are mainly fee leases with primary terms of three to five years. We believe that our lease terms are similar to our competitors’ fee lease terms as they relate to both primary term and royalty interests.
 Competition
 The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous entities, including major domestic and foreign oil companies, other independent oil and natural gas concerns and individual producers and operators. Many of these competitors are large, well‑established companies and have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects, as well as evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to find and develop reserves will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Please read “Risk Factors—We may be unable to compete effectively with larger companies, which may adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient revenues.”
 We are also affected by competition for drilling rigs, equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel. Starting with the downturn in commodity prices in late 2014, the United States onshore oil and natural gas industry experienced a surplus of drilling and completion rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, due to significantly lower commodity prices. Although this provided a temporary respite from the previous high demand environment, demand for such services and equipment have recently begun to increase as commodity prices have started to recover. If commodity prices continue to increase and exploration and production activity increases, market forces may revert to the previous situation that resulted in delayed development drilling and other exploration activities and caused significant increases in the prices for this equipment and personnel. We are unable to predict when, or if, such changes may occur or how they would affect our development and exploitation programs.

 Segment Information and Geographic Areas
 The Company operates in one industry segment, which is the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas, and all of its operations are conducted in one geographic area of the United States, as described under “—Our Operations—Our Areas of Operations.” Oil and Natural Gas Leases
 The typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises. The lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 19% to 25%. Our net revenue interests average 55% for our operated leases and 23% including all operated and non‑operated leases.
 Approximately 81% of our leases (based on net acreage) are held by existing production and do not require lease rental payments.
 Marketing and Major Customers
 Our oil is generally sold under short‑term, extendable and cancellable agreements with unaffiliated purchasers based on published price bulletins reflecting an established field posting price. As a consequence, the prices we receive for oil and liquids move up and down in direct correlation with the oil market as it reacts to supply and demand factors. We do not own any oil or liquids pipelines or other assets for the transportation of those commodities, and transportation costs related to moving oil are deducted from the price received for oil. In September of 2014, we signed a 10‑year oil gathering and transportation agreement with Monarch Oil Pipeline LLC, pursuant to which Monarch Oil Pipeline LLC built, at its expense, a new oil gathering system and connected the gathering system to our dedicated leases in Texas. The system began service during the fourth quarter of 2015 and provides connectivity to both a regional refinery market as well as the Cushing market hub. We have reserved capacity of up to 12,000 barrels per day on the system with the potential to increase throughput at a future date.
 Our natural gas is sold under both long‑term and short‑term natural gas purchase agreements. Natural gas produced by us is sold at various delivery points at or near producing wells to natural gas gathering and marketing companies. We receive proceeds from prices that are based on various pipeline indices less any associated fees. On virtually all of our natural gas production, we are paid for the extracted NGLs based on a negotiated percentage of the proceeds that are generated from the customer’s sale of the liquids, or based on other negotiated pricing arrangements. We do not own any natural gas pipelines or other assets for the transportation of natural gas.
 During the year ended December 31, 2017, the largest purchasers of our production were Plains Marketing LP (“Plains Marketing”) and ETC Field Services LLC, which accounted for approximately 40% and 22% of consolidated oil and gas sales, respectively. If we were to lose any one of our customers, the loss could temporarily delay production and sale of our oil and natural gas in the related producing region. If we were to lose any single customer, we believe we could identify a substitute customer to purchase the impacted production volumes. However, if one or more of our larger customers ceased purchasing oil or natural gas altogether, the loss of such customer could have a detrimental effect on our production volumes in general and on our ability to find substitute customers to purchase our production volumes. For a discussion of the risks associated with the loss of key customers, please read “Risk factors—Our customer base is concentrated, and the loss of any one of our key customers could, therefore, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.”
 Seasonality
 Generally, but not always, the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months, resulting in seasonal fluctuations in the price we receive for our natural gas production. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters sometimes lessen this fluctuation. Title to Properties
 Prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas properties, we perform title reviews on significant leases, and depending on the materiality of properties, we may obtain a title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. As a result, title examinations have been obtained on a significant portion of our properties.

 
  15

 

 As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we initially conduct only a cursory review of the titles to our properties on which we do not have proved reserves. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to material defects. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense. We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property.
 We conduct a portion of our operations through joint development agreements with third parties. Certain of our joint development agreements include complete‑to‑earn arrangements, whereby we are assigned title to properties from the third‑party after we complete wells. Occasionally, delivery of such assignments may be delayed. Furthermore, certain of our joint development agreements specify that assignments are only to occur when the wells are capable of producing hydrocarbons in paying quantities. These additional conditions to assignment of title may from time to time apply to wells of substantial value.
 We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material assets. Although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with the acquisition of real property, customary royalty interests and contract terms and restrictions, liens under operating agreements, liens related to environmental liabilities associated with historical operations, liens for current taxes and other burdens, easements, restrictions and minor encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we believe that none of these liens, restrictions, easements, burdens and encumbrances will materially detract from the value of these properties or from our interest in these properties or materially interfere with our use of these properties in the operation of our business. In addition, we believe that we have obtained sufficient rights‑of‑way grants and permits from public authorities and private parties for us to operate our business in all material respects as described in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
 Regulations
 Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. In particular, natural gas production and related operations are, or have been, subject to price controls, taxes and numerous other laws and regulations. All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in an area, and the unitization or pooling of wells, as well as regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and limit the number of wells or locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs within its jurisdiction.
 Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Although we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress and federal agencies, the states, and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are generally subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.
 Environmental Matters and Regulation
 Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment, as well as the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things:
· | require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  16

 


· | require the installation of pollution control equipment in connection with operations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | restrict or prohibit our drilling and production activities during periods when such activities might affect protected wildlife;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | place restrictions or regulations upon the types, quantities or concentrations of materials or substances used in our operations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | restrict the types, quantities or concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment or used in connection with drilling, production and transportation activities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | limit or prohibit drilling activities on lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as site restoration, pit closure and plugging of abandoned wells.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  These laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, federal, state and local lawmakers and agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations. Such changes could affect costs for environmental compliance, such as waste handling, permitting, or cleanup for the oil and natural gas industry and could have a significant impact on our operating costs.
 The following is a summary of some of the existing laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject.
 Solid and Hazardous Waste Handling and Releases
 The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non‑hazardous waste. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, production and transportation of oil and gas are currently excluded from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. In the course of our operations, however, we generate some industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, and waste oils, which may be regulated as hazardous wastes. Although a substantial amount of the waste generated in our operations are regulated as non‑hazardous solid waste rather than hazardous waste, there is no guarantee that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, or individual states will not adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of non‑hazardous waste. Moreover, it is possible that certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non‑hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. Pursuant to a Consent Decree with environmental groups that filed suit in 2016, EPA must review the exemption of oil and gas exploration and production wastes under RCRA by March 2019 and either determine revisions to the exemption are not necessary or undertake rulemaking to be completed by July 2021. Any repeal or modification of this or similar exemptions in comparable state statutes, would increase the volume of hazardous waste we are required to manage and dispose of, and would cause us, as well as our competitors, to incur increased operating expenses. Any such change could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of waste, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, also known as “Superfund,” and comparable state laws and regulations impose liability without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of substances designated under CERCLA as hazardous substances. These classes of persons, or so‑called potentially responsible parties, or PRPs, include current and past owners or operators of a site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at a site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to take actions in response to threats to public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the PRPs the costs of such action. Many states have adopted comparable or more stringent state statutes. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.

 Although CERCLA generally exempts “petroleum” from the definition of hazardous substance, in the course of our operations, we have generated and will generate wastes that may fall within CERCLA’s definition of hazardous substances and may have disposed of these wastes at disposal sites owned and operated by others. We may also be the owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released. To our knowledge, neither we nor our predecessors have been designated as a PRP by the EPA under CERCLA; we also do not know of any prior owners or operators of our properties that are named as PRPs related to their ownership or operation of such properties. If contamination is discovered at a site on which we are or have been an owner or operator or to which we sent hazardous substances, we could be liable for the costs of investigation and remediation and natural resources damages.
 We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years. Although we believe we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned, leased or operated by us, or on or under other locations, including offsite locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons were not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to RCRA, CERCLA, and analogous state laws. Spills or other contamination required to be remediated have not required material capital expenditures to date. In the future, we could be required to remediate property, including groundwater, containing or impacted by previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed or released by prior owners or operators, or property contamination, including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators) or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future or mitigate existing contamination.
 Clean Water Act
 The federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of produced water and other oil and natural gas wastes, into waters of the United States or waters of the state, both broadly defined terms. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The Clean Water Act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as require remedial or mitigation measures, for non‑compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. In the event of an unauthorized discharge of pollutants, we may be liable for penalties and costs. The EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers adopted in June 2015 a rule redefining the term “waters of the United States,” which establishes the scope of regulated waters under the Clean Water Act. Pursuant to an Executive Order released February 28, 2017, the agencies are in the process of reviewing the 2015 rule for rescission or revision. In addition, the 2015 rule has been and remains the subject of litigation challenging the rule. A nationwide judicial stay of the 2015 rule is expected to be lifted in February 2018 due to a recent Supreme Court decision addressing whether federal circuit courts or district courts have jurisdiction over challenges to the 2015 rule. The agencies adopted a rule on February 6, 2018 delaying the applicability of this rule nationwide until February 6, 2020, to allow time for the anticipated new rulemaking. The rule delaying applicability of the 2015 rule until 2020, however, has also been challenged in federal courts. Therefore, Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi have asked a federal district court for a nationwide preliminary injuction of the 2015 rule. The EPA also finalized regulations in 2016 under the Clean Water Act to set a zero-discharge standard for wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and other natural gas production activities to publicly‑owned treatment works. Safe Drinking Water Act
 The Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, regulates, among other things, underground injection operations. Congress in the past has considered legislation that would impose additional regulation under the SDWA upon the use of hydraulic fracturing fluids. If similar legislation is enacted in the future, it could impose on our hydraulic fracturing operations permit and financial assurance requirements, requirements that we adhere to construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. In addition to subjecting the injection of hydraulic fracturing to the SDWA regulatory and permitting requirements, the previously proposed legislation would have required the disclosure of the chemicals within the hydraulic fluids. In addition, the EPA has taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to the Underground Injection Control program in states in which the EPA is the permitting authority and released permitting guidance on the use of diesel fuel as an additive in hydraulic fracturing fluids. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released a study of the 

 
  18

 
potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health, concluding that there is scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities can potentially impact drinking water resources in the United States under some circumstances. A committee of the U.S. House of Representatives conducted its own investigation into hydraulic fracturing practices. The U.S. Department of Energy also studied hydraulic fracturing and provided broad recommendations regarding best practices and other steps to enhance companies’ safety and environmental performance of hydraulic fracturing. Legislation or other new requirements or restrictions regarding hydraulic fracturing could substantially increase compliance costs and the requirements could negatively impact our ability to conduct fracturing activities on our assets.
 Other Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing
 On May 19, 2014, the EPA published an advance notice of rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act, to gather information regarding the potential regulation of chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration and production. Also, effective June 24, 2015, the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, adopted rules regarding well stimulation, chemical disclosures, water management, and other requirements for hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands; however these rules were rescinded by rule in December 2017. BLM also adopted rules effective on January 17, 2017 to reduce venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and natural gas production activities on onshore federal and Indian leases. EPA issued a two-year stay of these requirements in December 2017 and on February 13, 2018 announced a rule proposal torescind several requirements and revise others. Effective December 5, 2016, the U.S. National Park Service, or NPS, finalized updates to its regulations governing non‑federal oil and gas rights, notably, eliminating exemptions affecting approval requirements for approximately 60% of the oil and gas operations located within the national park system and purporting to adopt under its own authority, the BLM rules on well stimulation invalidated by a district court. This regulation is targeted for agency review for potential rescission or revision purusant to the Executive Order No. 13783 titled “Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth” dated March 28, 2017.
 Hydraulic fracturing is also subject to regulation at the state and local levels. Several states have proposed or adopted legislative or administrative rules regulating hydraulic fracturing operations. For example, in 2011 the Railroad Commission of Texas adopted the Hydraulic Fracturing Chemical Disclosure Rule. The rule requires public disclosure of chemicals in fluids used in the hydraulic fracturing process for drilling permits issued after February 1, 2012. Additionally, Texas has authorized the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to suspend water use rights for oil and gas users in the event of serious drought conditions and has imposed more stringent emissions, monitoring, inspection, maintenance, and repair requirements on Barnett Shale operators to minimize Volatile Organic Compound, or VOC, releases. Other states that we operate in, including Oklahoma, have adopted similar chemical disclosure measures. 
 Some states, including Oklahoma and Texas, also assert the authority to shut down injection wells that are deemed to contribute to induced seismicity, or seismic activity that is caused by human activity. For example, on August 3, 2015, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (“OKCC”) adopted a plan calling for mandatory reductions in oil and gas wastewater disposal well volumes to address potential induced seismicity in Oklahoma, which was implemented in 2015 and 2016 by ongoing reductions or shut ins of disposal wells. In February 2017, the OKCC issued a directive aimed at limiting the growth in future underground injection disposal rates into the Arbuckle formation in an area with seismicity issues. In December 2016, the OKCC announced seismicity guidelines for hydraulic fracturing operations, under which monitoring results can trigger a pause or suspension of hydraulic fracturing operations to evaluate seismic activity. Please see “Risk Factors—Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas production activities as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs, additional operating restrictions or delays, which could adversely affect our production” for a further discussion of state hydraulic fracturing regulation. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular.
 Oil Pollution Act
 The primary federal law related to oil spill liability is the Oil Pollution Act, or the OPA, which amends and augments oil spill provisions of the Clean Water Act and imposes certain duties and liabilities on certain “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening United States waters or adjoining shorelines. For example, operators of certain oil and gas facilities must develop, implement and maintain facility response plans, conduct annual spill training for certain employees and provide varying degrees of financial assurance. A liable “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of a facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil 

 
  19

 
discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge, or in the case of offshore facilities, the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging facility is located. OPA assigns strict joint and several liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. Although defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA, they are limited. In the event of an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge, we may be liable for costs and damages.
 Air Emissions
 Our operations may be subject to the Clean Air Act, or CAA, and comparable state and local requirements for the control of emissions from sources of air pollution. Federal and state laws require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction. Major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent, federally imposed requirements including additional permits. Federal and state laws designed to control hazardous (toxic) air pollutants, might require installation of additional controls. Administrative enforcement actions for failure to comply strictly with air pollution regulations or permits are generally resolved by payment of monetary fines and correction of any identified deficiencies. Alternatively, regulatory agencies could bring lawsuits for civil penalties or injunctions or require us to forego construction, modification or operation of certain air emission sources.
 We may incur expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining or maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions. For instance, effective October 15, 2012, final federal rules established new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations, specifically addressing emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, and hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. The rules establish specific requirements regarding emissions from compressors, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment in addition to leak detection requirements for natural gas processing plants. In October 2012, several challenges to the EPA’s rules were filed by various parties, including environmental groups and industry associations. In a January 16, 2013 unopposed motion to hold this litigation in abeyance, the EPA indicated that it may reconsider some aspects of the rules. The case remains in abeyance. The EPA has since made several changes to the rules and has indicated that it may reconsider other aspects of the rules. Depending on the outcome of such judicial proceedings and regulatory actions, the rules may be further modified or rescinded or the EPA may issue new rules. These rules, as well as any modifications to these rules or additional rules, could require a number of modifications to our operations including the installation of new equipment. We have already reported some of our facilities as being subject to these rules and have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to control emissions, and to satisfy reporting and other administrative requirements associated with these rules. Additionally, federal rules to regulate emissions of methane and volatile organic compounds from new and modified sources in the oil and gas sector and to establish the alternative criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air‑quality permitting purposes became effective on August 2, 2016. This aggregation rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements across the oil and gas industry. Further, in 2015, the EPA adopted a lower national ambient air quality standard for ozone. This lower standard may cause additional areas to be designated as ozone nonattainment areas, causing states to revise their implementation plans to require additional emissions control equipment and to impose more stringent permit requirements on facilities in those areas. EPA anticipates promulgating final area designations under the new standard in the first half of 2018.
 Endangered Species and Migratory Birds
 The Endangered Species Act, or ESA, restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, activities adversely affecting that species or its habitat may be considered “take” and may incur liability. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Criminal liability has been imposed in some jurisdictions for even an incidental taking of migratory birds, and the federal government recently issued indictments under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to several oil and gas companies after dead migratory birds were found near reserve pits associated with drilling activities. However, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. Department of the Interior issued a new legal opinion that concludes that the Migratory Bird Treaty Act does not prohibit the accidental or “incidental” taking or killing of migratory birds.
 We conduct operations in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA may be present. On March 27, 2014, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the Lesser Prairie Chicken as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. The designated habitat for the Lesser Prairie Chicken encompasses significant portions of our properties in the Anadarko Basin. On September 1, 2015 a federal district court in Texas vacated the listing of the Lesser Prairie Chicken as a threatened species, holding the Fish and Wildlife Service did not sufficiently 

 
  20

 
account for voluntary range wide conservation efforts being implemented to protect the species. In July 2016, the Lesser Prairie Chicken was removed from the ESA List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife following the court order. However, as of November 29, 2016, the Fish and Wildlife Service completed initial reviews of a petition filed by environmental groups to list the Lesser Prairie Chicken as endangered and found substantial information that the petitioned action may be warranted. An assessment of the biological status of the Lesser Prairie Chicken began in 2015 and further action remains pending.
 In a special rule under ESA Section 4(d) released simultaneously with the decision to list the Lesser Prairie Chicken as threatened, the Fish and Wildlife Service exempted from “take” certain oil and gas and other activities conducted by a participant that could have resulted in an “incidental take” of the Lesser Prairie Chicken as long as the participant was enrolled in, and operating in compliance with, a range‑wide conservation plan endorsed by the Fish and Wildlife Service. The range‑wide conservation plan also included a Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances, or the CCAA, component that provides “take” coverage for properties enrolled into the CCAA before the listing was effective. Prior to the delisting, to mitigate the risk of liability from “incidental takes” of the Lesser Prairie Chicken, we enrolled affected leasehold interests in the CCAA. Given the delisted status of the Lesser Prairie Chicken, Jones may revisit its enrollment in the CCAA. 
 ESA issues remain dynamic. For example, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or limit future development activity in the affected areas. On August 23, 2016 an environmental group filed a Notice of Intent to sue the Fish and Wildlife Service for failure to act on 417 petitions to list species as threatened or endangered under the ESA. On November 21, 2016, the Fish and Wildlife Service issued its revised Mitigation Policy, providing a framework and goal to achieve a net gain in conservation outcomes, or at a minimum, no net loss of resources and their values, services, and functions resulting from proposed actions authorized under the ESA; however, this policy is being evaluated by the current administration and the outcome of that review remains unclear. We continue to evaluate the impact of these rules, agency actions, and legal challenges on our operations. The listing under the Endangered Species Act of species in areas that we operate could force us to incur additional costs and delay or otherwise limit or terminate our operations.
 National Environmental Policy Act
 Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands may be subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, which requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. All of our current production activities, as well as any exploration and development plans that may be proposed in the future, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay or impose additional conditions upon the development of oil and natural gas projects. Climate Change
 More stringent laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gases, or GHGs, may be adopted in the future and could cause us to incur material expenses in complying with them. Both houses of Congress have in the past actively considered, but not passed, legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs. In the absence of comprehensive federal legislation on GHG emission control, the EPA is regulating GHGs as pollutants under the CAA. The EPA has adopted regulations affecting emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and is also requiring permit review for GHGs from certain stationary sources that emit GHGs at levels above statutory and regulatory thresholds and are otherwise subject to CAA permitting requirements based on emissions of non‑GHG regulated air pollutants. We do not believe our operations are currently subject to these permitting requirements, but if our operations become subject to these or other similar requirements, we could incur significant costs to control our emissions and comply with regulatory requirements.
 In addition, the EPA has adopted a mandatory GHG emissions reporting program that imposes reporting and monitoring requirements on various types of facilities and industries. In 2010, the EPA issued final rules to expand its existing GHG reporting rule to include onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage, and distribution facilities. The rule requires reporting of GHG emissions by regulated entities to the EPA on an annual basis. In 2015, the EPA added reporting of GHG emissions from gathering and boosting systems, completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing, and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines to the GHG reporting rule. We are 

 
  21

 
currently required to monitor and report GHG emissions under this rule, and operational and/or regulatory changes could increase the burden of compliance with GHG emissions monitoring and reporting requirements.
 Because of the lack of any comprehensive legislative program addressing GHGs, there is continuing uncertainty regarding the further development of federal regulation of GHG‑emitting sources. Additionally, a number of states, either individually or as part of regional initiatives, have begun taking actions to control and/or reduce GHG emissions primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The international, federal, regional and local regulatory initiatives that target GHGs also could adversely affect the marketability of the oil and natural gas we produce. For example, in 2015, the United States participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement entered into force November 4, 2016, and requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. The United States has expressed an intention to withdraw from participation in the Paris Agreement, but some state and local governments have expressed intentions to take GHG-related actions. Due to the uncertainties surrounding the regulation of and other risks associated with GHG emissions, we cannot predict the financial impact of related developments on our operations, however, we do not expect our operations to be affected any differently than other similarly situated domestic competitors.
 In addition to legislative and regulatory developments, plaintiffs have brought judicial actions under common law theories against greenhouse gas emitting companies in recent years. For example, environmental advocacy groups filed five nearly identical lawsuits in 2017 seeking to hold a wide variety of companies that produce fossil fuels liable for the alleged impacts of the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to those fuels. The lawsuits primarily assert that the companies’ products have caused a sea level rise that is damaging the plaintiffs. Jones is not a defendant in these cases and we are unable to predict the outcome or potential impact of these cases on the oil and gas industry.
 The federal administration also issued a Climate Action Plan in June 2013. Among other things, the Climate Action Plan directs federal agencies to develop a strategy for the reduction of methane emissions, including emissions from the oil and natural gas industry. As previously mentioned, the EPA finalized a rule effective August 2016, setting standards for methane and volatile organic compound emissions from new and modified sources in the oil and gas sector. On November 10, 2016, the EPA issued a final Information Collection Request, or the ICR, that would have required numerous oil and gas companies to provide information regarding methane emissions from existing oil and gas facilities, but on March 2, 2017, EPA withdrew that ICR. The regulatory focus is shifting in the current administration, however, additional GHG regulation of the oil and gas industry remains a possibility. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations.
 OSHA and Other Laws and Regulation
 We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state statutes. These laws and regulations strictly govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right‑to‑know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these applicable requirements and with other OSHA and comparable requirements.
 We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to our current operations and that our continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We did not incur any material capital expenditures for remediation or pollution control activities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015. Additionally, we are not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital expenditures during 2018 or that will otherwise have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in the future. However, we cannot assure you that the passage of more stringent laws and regulations in the future will not have a negative impact on our business activities, financial condition or results of operations.
