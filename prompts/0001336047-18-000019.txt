Item 1.  Business
Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Report to “we,” “our,” “us” or like terms refer to the business of Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Introduction
We are a Delaware limited partnership formed in 2005. Our business, which is conducted by our primary subsidiary, Boardwalk Pipelines, LP (Boardwalk Pipelines) and its operating subsidiaries, as shown in the diagram below (together, the operating subsidiaries), consists of integrated natural gas and natural gas liquids and other hydrocarbons (herein referred to together as NGLs) pipeline and storage systems. All of our operations are conducted by the operating subsidiaries. Boardwalk Pipelines Holding Corp. (BPHC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Loews Corporation (Loews), owns 125.6 million of our common units and, through Boardwalk GP, LP (Boardwalk GP), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BPHC, our 2% general partner interest and all of our incentive distribution rights (IDRs). As of February 13, 2018, the common units and general partner interest owned by BPHC represent approximately 51% of our equity interests, excluding the IDRs. Our Partnership Interests, as described in Part II, Item 5 of this Report, contains more information on how we calculate BPHC’s equity ownership. Our common units are traded under the symbol “BWP” on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

The following diagram reflects a simplified version of our current organizational structure:

Our Business
We are a master limited partnership operating in the midstream portion of the natural gas and NGLs industry, providing transportation and storage for those commodities. We own approximately 14,335 miles of natural gas and NGLs pipelines and underground storage caverns having aggregate capacity of approximately 205.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of working natural gas and 24.5 million barrels (MMBbls) of NGLs. Our natural gas pipeline systems are located in the Gulf Coast region, Oklahoma, Arkansas and the Midwestern states of Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, and our NGLs pipelines and storage facilities are located in Louisiana and Texas. 
We serve a broad mix of customers, including producers of natural gas, local distribution companies (LDCs), marketers, electric power generators, industrial users and interstate and intrastate pipelines. We provide a significant portion of our natural gas pipeline transportation and storage services through firm contracts under which our customers pay monthly capacity reservation fees, which are fees owed regardless of actual pipeline or storage capacity utilization. Other fees are based on actual utilization of the capacity under firm contracts and contracts for interruptible services. Contracts for our NGLs services are generally fee-based or based on minimum volume requirements, while others are dependent on actual volumes transported or stored. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 83% of our revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees under firm contracts, approximately 11% of our revenues were derived from fees based on utilization under firm contracts and approximately 6% of our revenues were derived from interruptible transportation, interruptible storage, parking and lending (PAL) and other services. Part II, Item 6 of this Report contains a summary of our revenues from external customers, net income and total assets, all of which were attributable to our pipeline and storage systems operating in one reportable segment.

The maximum rates we can charge for most of our natural gas transportation services, as well as the general terms and conditions of those services, are established by, and subject to review and revision by, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). These rates are based upon certain assumptions to allow us the opportunity to recover the cost of providing these services and earn a reasonable return on equity. However, it is possible that we may not recover all of our costs or earn a return. We are authorized to charge market-based rates for the majority of our natural gas storage capacity pursuant to authority granted by the FERC. The Surface Transportation Board (STB), a division of the United States (U.S.) Department of Transportation (DOT), has authority to regulate the rates we charge for service on certain of our ethylene pipelines, while the Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC) regulates the rates we charge for service on our other NGL pipelines. The STB and LPSC require that our transportation rates are reasonable and that our practices cannot unreasonably discriminate among our shippers.
Our Pipeline and Storage Systems
We own and operate approximately 13,880 miles of interconnected natural gas pipelines, directly serving customers in thirteen states and indirectly serving customers throughout the northeastern and southeastern U.S. through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines. We also own and operate approximately 455 miles of NGLs pipelines in Louisiana and Texas. In 2017, our pipeline systems transported approximately 2.3 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of natural gas and approximately 64.7 MMBbls of NGLs. Average daily throughput on our natural gas pipeline systems during 2017 was approximately 6.4 Bcf. Our natural gas storage facilities are comprised of fourteen underground storage fields located in four states with aggregate working gas capacity of approximately 205.0 Bcf and our NGLs storage facilities consist of nine salt-dome caverns located in Louisiana with an aggregate storage capacity of approximately 24.5 MMBbls. We also own three salt-dome caverns and related brine infrastructure for use in providing brine supply services and to support the NGLs storage operations. 
The principal sources of supply for our natural gas pipeline systems are regional supply hubs and market centers located in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent regions, including offshore Louisiana, the Perryville, Louisiana, area, the Henry Hub in Louisiana and the Carthage, Texas, area. Our pipelines in the Carthage, Texas, area provide access to natural gas supplies from the Barnett and Haynesville Shales and other natural gas producing regions in eastern Texas and northern Louisiana. The Henry Hub serves as the designated delivery point for natural gas futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Our pipeline systems also have access to unconventional supplies such as the Woodford Shale in southeastern Oklahoma, the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas, the Eagle Ford Shale in southern Texas and wellhead supplies in northern and southern Louisiana and Mississippi, and we also receive gas in the Lebanon, Ohio, area from the Marcellus and Utica Shales located in the northeastern U.S. Our NGLs pipeline systems access the Gulf Coast petrochemical industry through our operations at our Choctaw Hub in the Mississippi River corridor area of Louisiana and the Sulphur Hub in the Lake Charles, Louisiana, area. We also access ethylene supplies at Port Neches, Texas, which we deliver to petrochemical-industry customers in Louisiana.
The following is a summary of each of our principal operating subsidiaries:
Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP (Gulf South): Our Gulf South pipeline system is located along the Gulf Coast in the states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. The on-system markets directly served by the Gulf South system 
5

are generally located in eastern Texas, Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. These markets include LDCs and municipalities located across the system, including New Orleans, Louisiana; Jackson, Mississippi; Mobile, Alabama; and Pensacola, Florida, and other end-users located across the system, including the Baton Rouge to New Orleans industrial corridor and Lake Charles, Louisiana. Gulf South also has indirect access to off-system markets through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated interstate and intrastate pipelines and storage facilities. These pipeline interconnections provide access to markets throughout the northeastern and southeastern U.S. 
Gulf South has ten natural gas storage facilities. The two natural gas storage facilities located in Bistineau, Louisiana, and Jackson, Mississippi, have approximately 83.5 Bcf of working gas storage capacity from which Gulf South offers firm and interruptible storage service, including no-notice service (NNS), and support pipeline operations. Gulf South also owns and operates eight high deliverability salt-dome natural gas storage caverns in Forrest County, Mississippi, having approximately 46.0 Bcf of total storage capacity, of which approximately 29.6 Bcf is working gas capacity, and owns undeveloped land which is suitable for up to five additional storage caverns. 
Texas Gas Transmission, LLC (Texas Gas): Our Texas Gas pipeline system is located in Louisiana, East Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio, with smaller diameter lines extending into Illinois. Texas Gas directly serves LDCs, municipalities and power generators in its market area, which encompasses eight states in the South and Midwest and includes the Memphis, Tennessee; Louisville, Kentucky; Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio; and Evansville and Indianapolis, Indiana, metropolitan areas. Texas Gas also has indirect market access to, and receives supply from, the Northeast through interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines. A large portion of the gas delivered by the Texas Gas system is used for heating during the winter months. 
Texas Gas owns nine natural gas storage fields, of which it owns the majority of the working and base gas. Texas Gas uses this gas to meet the operational requirements of its transportation and storage customers and the requirements of its NNS customers. Texas Gas also uses its storage capacity to offer firm and interruptible storage services.
Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC (Gulf Crossing): Our Gulf Crossing pipeline system is located near Sherman, Texas, and proceeds to the Perryville, Louisiana, area. The market areas are in the Midwest, Northeast and Southeast, including Florida, through interconnections with Gulf South, Texas Gas and unaffiliated pipelines.

Current Growth Projects
In response to changes in the natural gas industry and growth in the petrochemical industry, we have been engaged in several growth projects. Several of these growth projects were placed into service in 2016, including the Ohio to Louisiana Access project, the Southern Indiana Lateral, the Western Kentucky Market Lateral and a power plant project in South Texas. In 2017, the Northern Supply Access Project and portions of our Coastal Bend Header and Sulphur Storage and Pipeline Expansion projects were placed into service. In 2018, we signed a precedent agreement for a new project on our Gulf South system that will serve a proposed power plant in Texas. The project will provide approximately 0.2 Bcf/d of firm transportation service by adding compression at an existing compressor station and constructing a lateral. The cost of this project is expected to be approximately $100.0 million and has a proposed in-service date of 2020. This project remains subject to customary approvals. In 2018, we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $430.0 million related to our growth projects, which primarily consist of the final portions of the Coastal Bend Header project and a gas treating project in Texas and the following projects in Louisiana: three ethylene transportation and storage projects to serve industrial customers, the development of storage wells and associated infrastructure for brine supply services and two natural gas transportation projects to serve power plants. All of our growth projects are secured by long-term firm contracts. 
Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7 of this Report for further discussion of capital expenditures and financing.
Nature of Contracts

We contract with our customers to provide transportation and storage services on a firm and interruptible basis. We also provide bundled firm transportation and storage services, such as NNS and interruptible PAL services for our natural gas customers and brine supply services for certain petrochemical customers and fractionation services.
Transportation Services: We offer natural gas transportation services on both a firm and interruptible basis. Our natural gas customers choose, based upon their particular needs, the applicable mix of services depending upon availability of pipeline capacity, the price of services and the volume and timing of customer requirements. Our natural gas firm transportation customers reserve a specific amount of pipeline capacity at specified receipt and delivery points on our system. Firm natural gas customers generally pay fees based on the quantity of capacity reserved regardless of use, plus a commodity and a fuel charge paid on the volume of natural gas actually transported. Capacity reservation revenues derived from a firm service contract are generally consistent during the contract term, but can be higher in winter periods than the rest of the year, especially for NNS agreements. Firm transportation contracts generally range in term from one to twenty years, although we may enter into shorter- or longer-term contracts. In providing interruptible natural gas transportation service, we agree to transport natural gas for a customer when capacity is available. Interruptible natural gas transportation service customers pay a commodity charge only for the volume of gas actually transported, plus a fuel charge. Interruptible transportation agreements have terms ranging from day-to-day to multiple years, with rates that change on a daily, monthly or seasonal basis. Our NGLs transportation services are generally fee-based or based on minimum volume requirements.
Storage Services: We offer natural gas storage services on both a firm and interruptible basis. Firm storage customers reserve a specific amount of storage capacity, including injection and withdrawal rights, while interruptible customers receive storage capacity and injection and withdrawal rights when available. Similar to firm transportation customers, firm storage customers generally pay fees based on the quantity of capacity reserved plus an injection and withdrawal fee. Firm storage contracts 
7

typically range in term from one to ten years. Interruptible storage customers pay for the volume of gas actually stored plus injection and withdrawal fees. Generally, interruptible storage agreements are for monthly terms. We are able to charge market-based rates for the majority of our natural gas storage capacity pursuant to authority granted by the FERC. Our NGLs storage rates are market-based, and the contracts for NGLs services are typically fixed-price arrangements with escalation clauses.
No-Notice Services: NNS consist of a combination of firm natural gas transportation and storage services that allow customers to inject or withdraw natural gas from storage with little or no notice. Customers pay a reservation charge based upon the capacity reserved plus a commodity and a fuel charge based on the volume of gas actually transported. In accordance with its tariff, Texas Gas loans stored gas to certain of its no-notice customers who are obligated to repay the gas in-kind.
Parking and Lending Service: PAL is an interruptible service offered to customers providing them the ability to park (inject) or borrow (withdraw) natural gas into or out of our pipeline systems at a specific location for a specific period of time. Customers pay for PAL services in advance or on a monthly basis depending on the terms of the agreement.
Customers and Markets Served
We contract directly with producers of natural gas and with end-use customers, including LDCs, marketers, electric power generators, industrial users and interstate and intrastate pipelines, who, in turn, provide transportation and storage services for end-users. Based on our 2017 transportation, storage and PAL revenues, net of fuel, our customer mix was as follows: natural gas producers (46%), power generators (17%), LDCs (17%), marketers (13%) and industrial end-users and others (7%). Based upon our 2017 transportation, storage and PAL revenues, net of fuel, our deliveries were as follows: pipeline interconnects (50%), LDCs (18%), industrial end-users (11%), power generators (10%), storage activities (8%) and others (3%). No customer comprises 10% or more of our 2017 operating revenues.
Natural Gas Producers: Producers of natural gas use our services to transport gas supplies from producing areas, including shale natural gas production areas, to supply pools and to other customers on and off of our systems. Producers contract with us for storage services to store excess production and to optimize the ultimate sales prices for their gas.
Power Generators: Our natural gas pipelines are directly connected to 47 natural-gas-fired power generation facilities in nine states. The demand of the power generating customers generally peaks during the summer cooling season which is counter to the winter season peak demands of the LDCs, although recently we have begun to see an increase in demand from power generators in the winter months as well, due to the overall increase in the use of natural gas over other sources, such as coal, to generate electricity. Our power-generating customers can use a combination of NNS, firm and interruptible transportation services.

Local Distribution Companies: Most of our LDC customers use firm natural gas transportation services, including NNS. We serve approximately 173 LDCs at more than 300 delivery locations across our pipeline systems. The demand of these customers peaks during the winter heating season.

Marketers: Natural gas marketing companies utilize our services to provide services to our other customer groups as well as to customer groups in off-system markets. The services may include combined gas transportation and storage services to support the needs of the other customer groups. Some of the marketers are sponsored by LDCs or producers.
Industrial End-Users: We provide approximately 188 industrial facilities with a combination of firm and interruptible natural gas and NGLs transportation and storage services. Our pipeline systems are directly connected to industrial facilities in the Baton Rouge to New Orleans industrial corridor; Lake Charles, Louisiana; Mobile, Alabama; and Pensacola, Florida. We can also access the Houston Ship Channel through third-party natural gas pipelines.
Competition
We compete with numerous other pipelines that provide transportation, storage and other services at many locations along our pipeline systems. We also compete with pipelines that are attached to natural gas supply sources that are closer to some of our traditional natural gas market areas. In addition, regulators’ continuing efforts to increase competition in the natural gas industry have increased the natural gas transportation options of our traditional customers. For example, as a result of regulators’ policies, capacity segmentation and capacity release have created an active secondary market which increasingly competes with our own natural gas pipeline services. Further, natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to our customers, including electricity, coal, fuel oils and other alternative fuel sources.
The principal elements of competition among pipelines are availability of capacity, rates, terms of service, access to gas supplies, flexibility and reliability of service. In many cases, the elements of competition, in particular, flexibility, terms of service 
and reliability, are key differentiating factors between competitors. This is especially the case with capacity being sold on a longer-term basis. We are focused on finding opportunities to enhance our competitive profile in these areas by increasing the flexibility of our pipeline systems, such as modifying them to allow for bi-directional flows, to meet the demands of customers such as power generators and industrial users, and are continually reviewing our services and terms of service to offer customers enhanced service options.
Seasonality
Our revenues can be affected by weather, natural gas price levels, gas price differentials between locations on our pipeline systems (basis spreads), gas price differentials between time periods, such as winter to summer (time period price spreads), and natural gas price volatility. Weather impacts natural gas demand for heating needs and power generation, which in turn influences the short-term value of transportation and storage across our pipeline systems. Colder than normal winters can result in an increase in the demand for natural gas for heating needs and warmer than normal summers can impact cooling needs, both of which typically result in increased pipeline transportation revenues and throughput. While traditionally peak demand for natural gas occurs during the winter months driven by heating needs, the increased use of natural gas for cooling needs during the summer months has partially reduced the seasonality of our revenues. During 2017, approximately 53% of our operating revenues were recognized in the first and fourth quarters of the year.
Government Regulation
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission: The FERC regulates our interstate natural gas operating subsidiaries under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA). The FERC regulates, among other things, the rates and charges for the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce and the extension, enlargement or abandonment of facilities under its jurisdiction. Where required, our interstate natural gas pipeline subsidiaries hold certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the FERC covering certain of their facilities, activities and services. The FERC also prescribes accounting treatment for our interstate natural gas pipeline subsidiaries which is separately reported pursuant to forms filed with the FERC. The regulatory books and records and other activities of our subsidiaries that operate under the FERC's jurisdiction may be periodically audited by the FERC.
The maximum rates that may be charged by our operating subsidiaries that operate under the FERC's jurisdiction for all aspects of the natural gas transportation services they provide are established through the FERC’s cost-of-service rate-making process. Key determinants in the FERC’s cost-of-service rate-making process are the costs of providing service, the volumes of gas being transported, the rate design, the allocation of costs between services, the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn. The maximum rates that may be charged by us for storage services on Texas Gas, with the exception of services associated with a portion of the working gas capacity on that system, are also established through the FERC’s cost-of-service rate-making process. The FERC has authorized us to charge market-based rates for firm and interruptible storage services for the majority of our other natural gas storage facilities. None of our FERC-regulated entities has an obligation to file a new rate case, and Gulf South is prohibited from filing a rate case until May 1, 2023, subject to certain exceptions.
Texas Intrastate transports natural gas in intrastate commerce under the rules and regulations established by the Texas Railroad Commission and in interstate commerce that is subject to FERC jurisdiction under Section 311 of the NGPA. The maximum rates for services are established under Section 311 of the NGPA and are generally subject to review every five years by the FERC. 
U.S. Department of Transportation: We are regulated by DOT, through the Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration (PHMSA), under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended (NGPSA), and the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended (HLPSA). The NGPSA and HLPSA govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of interstate natural gas and NGLs pipeline facilities. We have received authority from PHMSA to operate certain natural gas pipeline assets under special permits that will allow us to operate those pipeline assets at higher than normal operating pressures of up to 0.80 of the pipe’s Specified Minimum Yield Strength (SMYS). Operating at higher than normal operating pressures allows us to transport all of the existing natural gas volumes we have contracted for with our customers. PHMSA retains discretion whether to grant or maintain authority for us to operate our natural gas pipeline assets at higher pressures and, in the event that PHSMA should elect not to allow us to operate at these higher pressures, it could affect our ability to transport all of our contracted quantities of natural gas on these pipeline assets, and we could incur significant additional costs to reinstate this authority or to develop alternate ways to meet our contractual obligations. PHMSA has also developed regulations that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain high risk areas, known as high consequence areas (HCAs), along our pipelines and take additional safety measures in the event of a release to protect pipeline segments located in those areas, which include highly populated areas. The NGPSA and HLPSA were amended by the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (2011 Act). The 2011 Act increased the penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required 
studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements by PHMSA for existing pipelines. In June 2016, the NGPSA and HLPSA were amended by the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (2016 Act), extending PHMSA’s statutory mandate through 2019 and, among other things, requiring PHMSA to complete certain of its outstanding mandates under the 2011 Act and developing new safety standards for natural gas storage facilities by June 22, 2018. The 2016 Act also empowers PHMSA to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing. PHMSA issued interim final regulations in October 2016 to implement the agency's expanded authority to address unsafe pipeline conditions or practices that pose an imminent hazard to life, property or the environment. New laws or regulations adopted by PHMSA may impose more stringent requirements applicable to integrity management programs and other pipeline safety aspects of our operations, which could cause us to incur increased capital and operating costs and operational delays.
Surface Transportation Board and Louisiana Public Service Commission: The STB has authority to regulate the rates we charge for service on certain of our ethylene pipelines, while the LPSC regulates the rates we charge for service on our other NGL pipelines. The STB and LPSC require that our transportation rates are reasonable and that our practices cannot unreasonably discriminate among our shippers.
Other: Our operations are also subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and occupational health and safety. Such laws and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste and in connection with spills, releases, discharges and emissions of various substances into the environment. Environmental regulations also require that our facilities, sites and other properties be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. Occupational health and safety regulations establish standards protective of workers, both generally and within the pipeline industry. These laws, as amended from time to time, that our operations are subject to, include, for example:

• | the Clean Air Act (CAA) and analogous state laws, which impose obligations related to air emission pollutants, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and regulations affecting reciprocating engines subject to Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards;


• | the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws, which establish the extent to which waterways are subject to federal or state jurisdiction and serve to regulate the discharge of wastewater from our facilities into state and federal waters;


• | the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly referred to as CERCLA, or the Superfund law, and analogous state laws, which regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or locations to which we have sent hazardous substance wastes for disposal;


• | the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and analogous state laws, which impose requirements for the generation, handling, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes at or from our facilities; and


• | the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and analogous state laws, which establish workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances and appropriate control measures.

Many states where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental or occupational health and safety legal requirements governing many of the same types of activities and those requirements can be more stringent than those adopted under federal laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these federal, state and local laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations, the occurrence of delays in permitting or the development or expansion of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations in affected areas. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, but there can be no assurance that continued compliance with existing requirements will not materially affect us or that the current regulatory standards will not become more onerous in the future, resulting in more significant costs to maintain compliance or increased exposure to significant liabilities, which could diminish our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.
