Item 1. Business.
Overview 
 
We were formed in April 2000 to develop the Dick’s Wings concept, and are the owner, operator and franchisor of the Dick’s Wings brand of restaurants. Our concept is currently comprised of 22 restaurants and two concession stands located in the States of Florida and Georgia. We offer a variety of boldly-flavored menu items highlighted by our Buffalo, New York-style chicken wings spun in our signature sauces and seasonings. We offer our customers a casual, family-fun restaurant environment designed to appeal to both families and sports fans alike. At Dick’s Wings, we strive to provide our customers with a unique and enjoyable experience from first bite to last call®.
 
Growth Strategy
 
We are committed to strategies and initiatives that we believe are centered on growing long-term sales, increasing profits, enhancing the customer experience and engaging our franchisees and employees. These strategies are intended to differentiate our brands from the competition, reduce the costs associated with managing our restaurants, and establish a strong presence for our brands in key markets across the country.
 
Our plan is to grow our company from a Florida and Georgia based franchisor of Dick’s Wings restaurants into a diversified restaurant company operating a portfolio of premium restaurant brands. We intend to focus on developing brands that offer a variety of high-quality food and beverages in a distinctive, casual, high-energy atmosphere in a diverse set of markets across the Unites States.
 
The first major component of our growth strategy is the continued development and expansion of our legacy Dick’s Wings brand. Key elements of our strategy include strengthening the brand, developing new menu items, improving our operations and service, driving customer satisfaction, and opening new restaurants in new and existing markets in the United States. We believe there are meaningful opportunities to grow the number of Dick’s Wings restaurants, and have implemented a rigorous and disciplined approach to drive franchising sales. In our existing markets, we plan to continue to open new restaurants until a market is penetrated to a point that will enable us to gain marketing, operational, cost and other efficiencies. In new markets, we plan to open several restaurants at a time to quickly build our brand awareness.
 
The other major component of our growth strategy is the acquisition of controlling and non-controlling financial interests in other restaurant brands offering us product and geographic diversification, like our acquisition of a 50% ownership interest in Paradise on Wings Franchise Group, LLC, a Utah limited liability company that is the franchisor of the Wing Nutz® brand of restaurants (“Paradise on Wings”), in January 2014. A description of our investment in Paradise on Wings is set forth herein under Note 4 – Investment in Paradise on Wings in our financial statements. We plan to complete, and are actively seeking, potential mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic initiatives through which we can acquire or develop additional restaurant brands. We are seeking brands offering proprietary menu items that emphasize the preparation of food with high quality ingredients, as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide appealing, tasty, convenient and attractive food at competitive prices.

As we acquire complementary brands, we will develop a scalable infrastructure that will help us expand our margins as we execute upon our growth strategy. Benefits of this infrastructure may include centralized support services for all of our brands, including marketing, menu development, human resources, legal, accounting and information systems. Additional benefits may include the ability to cost effectively employ advertising and marketing agencies for all of our brands, and efficiencies associated with being able to utilize a single distribution model for all of our restaurants. Accordingly, this structure should enable us to leverage our scale and share best practices across key functional areas that are common to all of our brands.
 
Restaurants
 
Our Dick’s Wings concept is comprised of traditional restaurants like our Dick’s Wings & Grill® restaurants, which are full service restaurants, and non-traditional units like our Dick’s Wings concession stands at EverBank Field. We currently have 22 Dick’s Wings & Grill restaurants and two Dicks’ Wings concession stands. Of our 22 restaurants, 17 are located in Florida and five are located in Georgia. Our concession stands are also located in Florida. Two of our restaurants are owned by us, and the remaining 20 restaurants are owned and operated by franchisees. The operation of our concession stands at EverBank Field has been assigned to a third-party operator.
 
Our restaurants typically range in size from 3,500 to 5,500 square feet and require an initial capital investment per restaurant of between $237,500 and $772,500. The initial capital investment is comprised of cash pre-opening costs and build-out costs. Factors contributing to the fluctuation in the initial capital investment per location include the size of the property, the geographical location, the type of construction, the cost of liquor and other licenses, and the type and amount of concessions, if any, received from landlords. We offer lower cost conversion packages that provide prospective franchisees with flexibility to convert existing restaurants of other brands into a Dick’s Wings restaurant. Because of this, some of our restaurants may be smaller or larger or cost more or less than the typical ranges.
 
Our restaurants are typically open on a daily basis from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, and from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. or 1 a.m. on Friday and Saturday, although closing times may vary depending on the day of the week and applicable regulations governing the sale of alcoholic beverages.
 
Dick’s Wings Menu
 
Our restaurants feature a variety of menu items highlighted by our traditional and boneless Buffalo, New York-style chicken wings spun in our signature sauces and seasonings. Our sauces and seasonings range in heat intensity from mild to blazing hot and include such flavors as Applewood Honey BBQ, Bourbon, Cajun Ranch, Caribbean Gold, Caribbean Jerk, Florida Girl, Garlic Parmesan, Georgia Girl, Gold Rush, Honey BBQ, Lemon Pepper, Mango Habanero, Ragin’ Cajun, Smokey Mountain Gold, and Victory Lane. These sauces and seasonings can be blended together to create more than 365 flavors. We also sell our proprietary Dick’s Secret Sauce and Firestorm sauces at our restaurants. Our sauces and seasonings complement and distinguish our chicken wings and other menu offerings to create a bold flavor profile for our customers. Other menu items that we offer include chicken tenders, quesadillas, specialty burgers and sandwiches, salads, wraps, flatbreads and desserts. We also provide kids meal options for children. All of our restaurants offer an extensive selection of domestic, imported and craft beers and wine, and the majority of our restaurants feature a full bar offering a variety of liquor and spirits. We also introduce new menu items from time to time.

We are focused on continually elevating our unique and high-quality food and beverage offerings. Our goal is to balance the established menu offerings that appeal to our loyal customers with new menu items, like our Dick’s Blingz® boneless chicken wings, that increase customer frequency and attract new customers. We believe that the development of new products can drive traffic by expanding our customer base and help us continue to build brand leadership in food quality and taste. For all new menu roll-outs, new product launches are combined with a new menu design and updated pricing to reflect the current economic environment, as well as our current strategic marketing and creative plan. All of our menu items are made-to-order and are available for take-out.
 
Restaurant Atmosphere 
 
We offer our customers a casual, family-fun restaurant environment designed to appeal to both families and sports fans alike. Our restaurants have a children’s area filled with video games and other forms of children’s entertainment that is visible from each of the tables in the restaurant, making our restaurants an ideal place for families to take their children. Our restaurants also have high-definition televisions located throughout the restaurants, making our restaurants an ideal gathering place for sports enthusiasts. We tailor the content and volume of our video and audio programming to reflect our customers’ tastes. We believe the design of our restaurants enhances our customers’ experiences, drives repeat visits, and solidifies the broad appeal of our brand.
Branding
 
We established our Dick’s Wings brand through coordinated marketing and operational execution that ensures brand recognition, quality and consistency throughout our concept. These efforts include marketing programs and advertising to support our restaurants. We prominently feature our Dick’s Wings logos, bright colors, sports memorabilia, televisions and exterior trade dress at our restaurants and as branding for our marketing and advertising materials. Our brand is further strengthened by our emphasis on operational excellence supported by operating guidelines and employee training in our restaurants. We believe our brand has broad appeal because it attracts customers of all ages, our menu offers a variety of items, and our distinctive sauces allow customers to customize their experience, appealing to many tastes. Our distinctive concept, combined with our high-quality food, makes Dick’s Wings appeal to families, children, teenagers and adults of all ages and socio-economic backgrounds.
Franchisees and Franchise Agreements
 
Our franchise program is designed to promote consistency and quality. We believe that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with our franchisees. To this end, we invest a significant amount of time working with our franchisees on key aspects of the business, including products, equipment, operational improvements and standards, and management techniques. Franchisees are approved on the basis of their business background, evidence of restaurant management experience, net worth and capital available for investment in relation to the scope of the proposed business relationship. Franchisees can range in size from individuals owning a single restaurant to larger corporate entities owning several restaurants.

Franchisees are required to execute a franchise agreement containing a standard set of terms and conditions prior to opening a Dick’s Wings restaurant. Under our franchise agreement, we grant franchisees the right to operate restaurants using the “Dick’s Wings” trademarks, trade dress and other intellectual property within the Dick’s Wings system, which includes uniform operating procedures, standards for consistency and quality of products, technical knowledge, and procedures for accounting, inventory control and management. In return, franchisees supply capital, initially by paying a franchisee fee to us in the amount of $35,000, purchasing or leasing the building and land, and purchasing the equipment, signs, seating, inventories and supplies necessary for the operation of the restaurant, and, over the longer term, by reinvesting in the business. Franchisees are required to make weekly royalty payments to us in an amount equal to five percent of the gross revenue they generate during the applicable week. They are also required to spend at least two percent of their gross revenue on local advertising and contribute at least one percent, but not more than two percent, of their gross revenue to our general advertising fund.
 
Our franchise agreements require that each franchised restaurant be operated in accordance with our defined operating procedures, adhere to the menu established by us, meet applicable quality, service, health and cleanliness standards, and comply with all applicable laws. We have the right to terminate a franchise agreement if the franchisee fails to pay us royalties, make contributions and expenditures for advertising, or otherwise operate and maintain its restaurant in accordance with the requirements of the agreement. Franchise agreements are not assignable without our consent, and we have a right of first refusal if a franchisee proposes to sell a restaurant. The initial term of the typical franchise agreement is 10 years with a 10-year renewal option for the franchisee, subject to conditions contained in the franchise agreement.
 
We also offer area development agreements pursuant to which we grant franchisees the right to open a specified number of Dick’s Wings restaurants within an exclusive development area in accordance with a specified development schedule. Our area development agreement establishes the number of restaurants that must be developed within a defined geographic area and the deadlines by which these restaurants must open. Franchisees that enter into an area development agreement pay us an initial franchise fee of $35,000 for the first restaurant and an area development fee determined by multiplying $15,000 by the number of additional restaurants to be opened in the area. Thereafter, franchisees pay us an initial franchise fee of $30,000 for each subsequent restaurant that they open, against which a credit in the amount of $15,000 is applied. The area development agreement can be terminated by us if, among other reasons, the area developer fails to open restaurants on schedule.
 
Site Selection
 
Our site selection process is integral to the successful execution of our growth strategy, and we devote significant effort to the investigation of new locations utilizing a variety of analytical techniques. The process begins with the selection of a proposed site by us or a franchisee. In the case of franchisees, once a site proposal package is submitted to us by a franchisee, we review the proposal to determine whether or not we will accept it. Criteria that we consider for our prospective sites and those of our franchisees include:
 
6

 


· | local market demographics, population density and psychographic profiles;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | occupancy rates and projected growth rates in the trade area;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | the location and performance of big box retailers and nationally branded peers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | available square footage, parking and lease economics;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | local investment and operating costs;
--+--------------------------------------


· | development and expansion constraints;
--+---------------------------------------


· | vehicle traffic patterns, visibility and access;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | regional consumer trends and preferences;
--+------------------------------------------


· | those characteristics that are similar to our most successful existing restaurants; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | other quantitative and qualitative measures.
--+---------------------------------------------

 
The specific rate at which we are able to open new restaurants is determined, in part, by our success in locating satisfactory sites, negotiating acceptable lease or purchase terms, securing appropriate local governmental permits and approvals, and by our capacity to supervise construction and recruit and train management and hourly employees.
 
We periodically re-evaluate restaurant sites to ensure attributes have not deteriorated below our minimum standards. In the event site deterioration occurs, we make a concerted effort to improve the restaurant’s performance by providing physical, operating and marketing enhancements unique to each restaurant’s situation. If efforts to restore the restaurant’s performance to acceptable minimum standards are unsuccessful, we consider relocation to a proximate, more desirable site, or evaluate closing the restaurant if the brand’s measurement criteria, such as return on investment and area demographic trends, do not support relocation. We perform a comprehensive analysis that examines restaurants not performing at a required rate of return. If local market conditions warrant, we will relocate restaurants to a proximate, more desirable site that will strengthen our presence in the applicable trade area or market. Historically, restaurants that we have closed were generally performing below our standards or were near or at the expiration of their lease terms. Our strategic plan is targeted to support our long-term growth objectives, with a focus on continued development of those restaurant locations that have the greatest return potential for us and our shareholders.
 
Operations
 
We believe that operational excellence is critical to our long-term success. We define operational excellence as an uncompromising attention to the details of our recipes, food preparation, cooking procedures, handling procedures, sanitation, cleanliness and safety. Our operations strategy is designed to drive best-in-class restaurant operations by us and our franchisees and improve friendliness, cleanliness, speed of service and overall customer satisfaction to drive long-term growth.

Our restaurants are required to be operated in accordance with uniform operating standards and specifications relating to the selection, handling and preparation of menu items, food quality and safety, signage, decor, equipment maintenance, cleanliness, uniforms, suppliers, facility standards, customer service and accounting controls. We and our franchisees utilize detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of our restaurant operations, as well as food and beverage manuals that detail the preparation procedures of our recipes. Each franchisee is required to furnish us with weekly sales and operating reports that assist us in monitoring the franchisee’s compliance with its franchise agreement. We make both announced and unannounced inspections of our restaurants to ensure that our practices and procedures are being followed. We systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards and conduct meetings with our franchisees to discuss the results of our reviews. When a restaurant falls below minimum standards, we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes, and implement marketing and operational plans to improve the restaurant’s performance. If the restaurant’s performance does not improve to acceptable levels, the restaurant is evaluated for relocation or closing.
 
An important aspect of our concept is the efficient design, layout and execution of our kitchen operations. Due to the relatively simple preparation of our menu items, the kitchen consists of fryers, grills and food preparation stations that are arranged assembly-line style for maximum productivity. Given our menu and kitchen design, our kitchens are staffed with hourly employees who require only basic training before reaching full productivity. We do not require the added expense of an on-site chef. The ease and simplicity of our kitchen operations allows us to achieve our goal of preparing quality food with minimal wait times.
 
Training
 
Our training program is available to our employees as well as our franchisees and their employees. It offers food safety, quality assurance and other programs that are designed to ensure that our employees and our franchisees and their employees are trained in proper food handling techniques. Before a restaurant opens for business, each of our company-owned restaurant managers and franchisees must attend and successfully complete our training program. The training program is conducted in Jacksonville, Florida and lasts for between two and four weeks, unless we determine that additional training is needed. During our training program, we describe our philosophies and policies for administration, marketing, general manager tasks, operations by position, food preparation, set up and closing procedures, cleaning and sanitation, food borne illnesses and employee hygiene. We also utilize operation simulations. We offer customized instruction as needed and offer additional or refresher training courses from time to time. Our company-owned restaurant managers and franchisees are certified in comprehensive state-approved food safety and sanitation courses, such as ServSafe, developed by the National Restaurant Association.
Marketing and Advertising
 
We market our Dicks’ Wings restaurants as family fun fooderys® where both families and sports fans can go to have a unique and enjoyable restaurant experience from first bite to last call. Our marketing programs are designed to differentiate our Dick’s Wings restaurants from the restaurants of our competitors and showcase our food and brand in a family fun atmosphere. These efforts include marketing campaigns and advertising to support our restaurants. The primary goal of these efforts is to build brand awareness throughout the areas where we have restaurants located. Our marketing and advertising campaigns are also designed to: (i) support strong restaurant openings, (ii) drive positive same-store sales through additional visits by our existing customers and visits by new customers, (iii) increase average order size, and (iv) increase profit margins. Given our strategy to be a neighborhood destination, community marketing is key to driving sales and developing brand awareness in each market.

Our marketing strategy is fact-based, using consumer insights to build brand affinity and drive menu optimization. Local advertising is developed and implemented by us and our franchisees, and includes such events as live bands, car shows, pay-per-view television events and pool tournaments. System-wide marketing, advertising and promotions are developed and implemented by us through the use of our general advertising fund, which we use to pay for advertising costs, sales promotions, market research and other support functions. We implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase the sales and profits of us and our franchisees and strengthen our brands. We also rely on outdoor billboard, direct mail and email advertising, as well as radio, newspapers, digital coupons, search engine marketing and social media such as Facebook® and Twitter®, as appropriate, to attract and retain customers for us and our franchisees. As part of our marketing strategy, we provide our company-owned restaurants and franchisees with advertising support and guidance to ensure that a consistent message is being delivered to the public.
 
Supply and Distribution
 
We strive to maintain high quality standards. In furtherance of this, we establish the standards and specifications for the products used in the development and operation of our restaurants and for the direct and indirect sources of most of those items. We also have the right to require, and generally do require, that our company-owned restaurants and franchisees purchase products and services only from manufacturers and suppliers that we approve, and utilize distributors that we approve. We have arranged for our company-owned restaurants and franchisees to purchase food, supplies and paper goods from Gordon Food Service, Inc., and purchase soda beverages from The Coca-Cola Company. These requirements help us assure the quality and consistency of the products sold at our restaurants, and help us protect and enhance the image of the Dick’s Wings concept and brand.
 
We provide detailed specifications to suppliers for our food ingredients, products and supplies. To maximize our purchasing efficiencies and obtain the lowest possible prices for our ingredients, products and supplies, we negotiate prices based on system-wide usage of these items by our restaurants. Suppliers are chosen based upon their ability to provide competitive pricing, a continuous supply of product that meets all safety and quality specifications, logistics expertise and freight management, customer service, and transparency of business relationships. We have not experienced any significant continuous shortages of supplies, and believe that competitively priced, high quality alternative suppliers are available should the need arise. We do not utilize the services of any purchasing or distribution cooperatives.
 
Information Technology
 
All of our restaurants are equipped with a computerized point-of-sale system. Our point-of-sale system provides effective communication between the kitchen and the server, allowing employees to serve customers in a quick and consistent manner while maintaining a high level of control. It includes a back office system that has the capability to provide support for inventory, payroll, accounting, accounts payable, cash management and management reporting functions. The system also helps dispatch and monitor delivery activities in our restaurants. Our point-of-sale system provides us with the ability to generate weekly and period-to-date operating results on a company-wide, brand-wide, regional or individual restaurant basis. This enables us to closely monitor sales, food and beverage costs, and labor and operating expenses at each of our restaurants. Our point-of-sale system runs on non-proprietary hardware with open architecture and offers intuitive touch screen interface and integrated credit and gift card processing.

We intend to implement additional technology-enabled business solutions in the future targeted at improved financial control, cost management, enhanced customer service and improved employee effectiveness. These solutions will be designed to be used across all of our restaurants and brands. Our strategy is to fully integrate the systems to drive operational efficiencies and enable restaurant teams to focus on restaurant operations excellence.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We own U.S. registered trademarks for many of the logos, designs and expressions that identify the products and services that we use in our business, including “Dick’s Wings” and “Dick’s Wings & Grill”, and have several U.S. registered trademark applications pending. We also have common law trademark rights for certain of our proprietary marks. We believe that our trademarks have significant value and are important to our business. Our policy is to pursue registration of our important trademarks whenever feasible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our trademarks. Under current law and with proper use and registration, our rights in our trademarks will generally last indefinitely. The use of these trademarks by our franchisees has been authorized in our franchise agreements.
 
We may rely, and in some circumstances do rely, on trade secrets and common law rights to protect our intellectual property. We have established the standards and specifications for most of the goods and services used in the development, improvement and operation of our Dick’s Wings restaurants. These proprietary standards, specifications and restaurant operating procedures are trade secrets owned by us. We protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees and franchisees, and have included confidentiality provisions in our franchise agreements. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Notwithstanding these protective measures, trade secrets and proprietary rights can be difficult to enforce. While we have confidence in the protective measures that we have implemented, our agreements and security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach.
 
Competition
 
The restaurant industry is fragmented and intensely competitive. We compete directly with Buffalo Wild Wings, East Coast Wings & Grill, Hooters, Hurricane Grill & Wings, Wings ‘N More, Wings N’ Things, Wingstop and other restaurants offering chicken wings as one of their primary food offerings. We also compete with local and regional sports bars and national casual dining establishments, and to a lesser extent with quick service restaurants such as wing-based take-out concepts. Furthermore, because the restaurant industry has few barriers to entry, new competitors may emerge at any time. We compete with other restaurants and retail establishments on the basis of taste, quality and price of food offered, menu offering, perceived value, service, atmosphere, location and overall dining experience. We also compete with other restaurants and retail establishments for qualified franchisees, site locations and employees to work in our restaurants.
 
10

 

Many of our direct and indirect competitors are well-established national, regional and local restaurant chains that have been in business longer than we have, have greater consumer awareness than we do, and have substantially greater capital, marketing and human resources than we do. Due to the continuing difficult economic environment for casual dining restaurants, coupled with continuing pressure on consumer spending at restaurants in general, we expect that our larger chain restaurant competitors will continue to allocate substantial financial resources to their national media advertising and discounting programs in order to protect their respective market shares. Notwithstanding this, we believe that our attractive price-value relationship, the atmosphere of our restaurants, our focus on customers, and the quality and distinctive flavor of our food differentiates us from our competitors.
 
Government Regulation
 
The restaurant industry is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to health, safety, sanitation, and building and fire codes, including compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental laws and regulations. We and our franchisees are required to obtain various permits and licenses to comply with some of these laws and regulations. Difficulties experienced by us or our franchisees in obtaining, or the failure by us or our franchisees to obtain, required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development of a new restaurant in a particular area. Difficulties experienced by us or our franchisees in renewing, or the failure by us or our franchisees to maintain, required licenses or approvals could result in the restaurant being shut down temporarily or permanently by the applicable government agency. We have implemented policies, procedures and training to help ensure that our employees and franchisees comply with these laws and regulations.
 
Our restaurants are subject to licensing and regulation by federal, state and local departments relating to alcoholic beverages. We and our franchisees must obtain appropriate licenses from regulatory authorities allowing them to sell liquor, beer and wine at our restaurants. These licenses must be renewed annually and may be suspended or revoked at any time. In addition, alcoholic beverage control regulations affect many aspects of our restaurant operations, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, trade practices, wholesale purchasing, inventory control, and the handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. We and our franchisees may also be subject in certain states to “dram-shop” statutes, which generally allow a person injured by an intoxicated person to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person.
 
We and our franchisees are subject to federal and state employment laws and regulations, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Immigration Reform and Control Act.  These laws and regulations govern such matters as wage and hour requirements, workers’ compensation insurance, unemployment and other taxes, working and safety conditions, and citizenship and immigration status. A significant number of our and our franchisees’ service, food preparation and other employees are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage, which is currently $7.25 per hour. The amount that we and our franchisees must pay these employees is influenced by the tip credit allowance, which is the amount that an employer is permitted to assume an employee receives in tips when the employer calculates the employee’s hourly wage for minimum wage compliance purposes. Increases in the federal minimum wage, directly or by either a decrease in the tip credit amount or an insufficient increase in the tip credit amount to match an increase in the federal minimum wage, would increase labor costs for us and our franchisees. In addition, employee claims based on, among other things, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, wage and hour requirements, and payments to employees who receive gratuities, may divert financial and management resources and adversely affect our operations or those of our franchisees.
 
11

 

We and our franchisees must comply with applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and related state laws. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act and related state laws, we and our franchisees must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment, and when constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of our restaurants, we must make those facilities accessible to disabled persons. We and our franchisees must also comply with other anti-discrimination laws and regulations, such as the Civil Rights Act and the Age Discrimination Act, which mandate that people be dealt with on an equal basis regardless of such personal traits as sex, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation and gender identity.
 
Our franchising activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) as well as the rules and regulations of the states in which we operate. The FTC’s “Franchise Rule” and other federal and state laws regulate the sale of franchises, require registration of the franchise disclosure document with state authorities, and require the delivery of a franchise disclosure document to prospective franchisees. These state laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions, the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise, and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply.
 
The operation of our restaurants is subject to laws and regulations relating to nutritional content, nutritional labeling, product safety, menu labeling and other regulations imposed by the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), including the Food Safety Modernization Act. Regulations relating to nutritional labeling may lead to increased operational complexity and expenses and may negatively impact sales by us and our franchisees.
 
We and our franchisees are also subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of government agencies and industry groups have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers and financial information.
 
Environmental Matters
 
We and our franchisees are subject to various federal, state and local environmental regulations, and increasing focus by U.S. governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives. Various laws concerning the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and restaurant waste and the operation of restaurants in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our and our franchisees’ operations. To the extent these initiatives cause an increase in supply or distribution costs for us or our franchisees, they may impact our business both directly and indirectly. However, we do not expect compliance with applicable environmental regulations to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, financial condition, results of operations, or competitive position.

Acquisitions
 
In January 2014, we acquired a 50% interest in Paradise on Wings, which is the franchisor of the Wing Nutz brand of restaurants, for $400,000 in cash and $400,000 in shares of our common stock. The Wing Nutz concept is comprised of family-friendly, sports-themed restaurants offering a large selection of premium baked chicken wings, boneless wings, hog wings, chicken tenders, wraps, salads, nachos, sandwiches, quesadillas and other baked products. It also offers its own proprietary line of craft beers under the name “Nut Job Beers”. Wing Nutz currently has eight restaurants in Utah, two restaurants in Texas and one restaurant in each of Nevada and Idaho. A description of our investment in Paradise on Wings is set forth herein under Note 4 – Investment in Paradise on Wings in our financial statements.
 
On December 19, 2016, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Seediv, LLC, a Louisiana limited liability company (“Seediv”), for $600,000 and an earn-out payment. Seediv is the owner and operator of the Dick’s Wings & Grill restaurant located at 100 Marketside Avenue, Suite 301, in the Nocatee development in Ponte Vedra, Florida 32081 (the “Nocatee Restaurant”) and the Dick’s Wings & Grill restaurant located at 6055 Youngerman Circle in Argyle Village in Jacksonville, Florida 32244 (the “Youngerman Circle Restaurant”; together with the Nocatee Restaurant, the “Nocatee and Youngerman Restaurants”). A description of our acquisition of Seediv is set forth herein under Note 5 – Acquisition of Seediv in our financial statements.
 
We intend to acquire additional restaurant brands offering us product and geographic diversification during the next 12 months. We may also acquire additional Dick’s Wings & Grill restaurants, or acquire other restaurants that we will convert into Dick’s Wings & Grill restaurants, during the next 12 months.
 
Seasonality
 
We do not consider our business to be seasonal to any material degree.
 
Employees
 
As of June 22, 2017, we had a total of 88 employees. Of this number, 32 full-time employees and 51 part-time employees worked in our company-owned restaurants. The remaining employees, of which four were full-time employees and one was a part-time employee, worked in our corporate office. Our franchisees are independent business owners, so their employees are not employees of ours and, therefore, are not included in our employee count. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our working conditions and compensation packages are competitive and that our relations with our employees are good.
Available Information
 
We file reports and other materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and proxy statements. We make available free of charge through our website at www.arcgrpinc.com all materials that we file electronically with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing or furnishing such material with the SEC. These materials are also available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov, and may be read and copied by visiting the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. Information on the operation of the public reference room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
