ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
The Company
The Registrant, Connecticut Water Service, Inc. (referred to as “the Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) was incorporated in 1974, with The Connecticut Water Company (“Connecticut Water”) as its largest subsidiary which was organized in 1956. Connecticut Water Service, Inc. is a non-operating holding company, whose income is derived from the earnings of its six wholly-owned subsidiary companies as of December 31, 2017.  In 2017, approximately 95% of the Company’s net income was attributable to water operations carried out within its four regulated water companies, Connecticut Water, The Heritage Village Water Company (“HVWC”), The Avon Water Company (“Avon Water”) and The Maine Water Company (“Maine Water”), together the “Regulated Companies”.  As of December 31, 2017, the Regulated Companies supplied water to 135,645 customers, representing a population of approximately 450,000, in 80 municipalities throughout Connecticut and Maine and more than 3,000 wastewater customers in Southbury, CT.  The Regulated Companies are subject to state regulation regarding financial issues, rates, and operating issues, and to various other state and federal regulatory agencies concerning water quality and environmental standards.
In addition to its Regulated Companies, the Company owns two active unregulated companies.  In 2017, these unregulated companies, together with real estate transactions within Connecticut Water, contributed the remaining 5% of the Company’s net income through real estate transactions as well as services and rentals.  The two active unregulated companies are Chester Realty, Inc., a real estate company in Connecticut; and New England Water Utility Services, Inc. (“NEWUS”), which provides contract water and sewer operations and other water related services.
Our mission centers on passionate employees delivering life sustaining, high quality water service to families and communities while providing a fair return to our shareholders.

Proposed Merger with SJW Group
On March 14, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with SJW Group, a Delaware corporation (“SJW”), and Hydro Sub, Inc., a Connecticut corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of SJW (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW (the “Merger”). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of our common stock (other than certain cancelled shares) will be converted into the right to receive 1.1375 shares of SJW common stock, the equivalent of $61.86 per share, or about $750 million in the aggregate, based on SJW’s closing stock price as of March 14, 2018, and the agreed upon exchange ratio.
The Board of Directors approved, adopted and declared advisable and resolved to recommend to the Company’s shareholders the approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger following a comprehensive review of the transaction. The Merger is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including, among other things, approval of the Merger Agreement by the Company’s shareholders, approval of the issuance of SJW common stock in the Merger by SJW’s stockholders, and regulatory approvals (including the approval of PURA and MPUC). The Merger is expected to close by year-end 2018.
Our Regulated Companies
Our Regulated Companies are subject to seasonal fluctuations and weather variations.  The demand for water is generally greater during the warmer months than the cooler months due to customers’ incremental water consumption related to cooling systems and various outdoor uses such as private and public swimming pools and lawn sprinklers.  Demand will vary with rainfall and temperature levels from year to year and season to season, particularly during the warmer months. The financial risk associated with changes in demand was mitigated in the State of Connecticut due to the adoption of the Water Revenue Adjustment (“WRA”) by Connecticut Water in 2013 and by HVWC in 2017. Currently, Avon Water has not utilized the WRA.
In general, the profitability of the water utility industry is largely dependent on the timeliness and adequacy of rates allowed by utility regulatory commissions. In addition, profitability is affected by numerous factors over which we have little or no control, such as costs to comply with security, environmental, and water quality regulations. Inflation and other factors also impact costs for construction, materials and personnel related expenses.
The Company believes that we are presently in compliance with current environmental and water quality regulations, but the regulations are subject to change at any time.  The costs to comply with future changes in state or federal regulations, which could require us to modify existing filtration facilities and/or construct new ones, or to replace any reduction of the safe yield from any of our current sources of supply, could be substantial.
Regulatory Matters
The rates we charge our water and waste water customers in Connecticut and Maine are established under the jurisdiction of and are approved by PURA and MPUC, respectively.  It is our policy to seek rate relief as necessary to enable us to achieve an adequate rate of return.  Connecticut Water’s allowed return on equity and return on rate base, effective as of December 31, 2017 were 9.75% and 7.32%, respectively. HVWC’s blended water and wastewater allowed return on equity and return on rate base, effective December 31, 2017, were 10.10% and 7.19%, respectively. Avon Water’s allowed return on equity and return on rate base, effective December 31, 2017, were 10.00% and 7.79%, respectively. Maine Water’s average allowed return on equity and return on rate base, as of December 31, 2017 were 9.50% and 7.96%, respectively. PURA establishes rates in Connecticut on a company-wide basis while the MPUC approves Maine Water’s rates on a division-by-division basis. Each of Connecticut Water, HVWC, Avon Water and Maine Water are allowed to add surcharges to customers’ bills in order to recover certain costs associated with approved capital projects in between full rate cases, as well as approved surcharges for the WRA, in Connecticut, as discussed in more detail below. HVWC has not added surcharges to customers’ bills in order to recover certain approved capital projects as of December 31, 2017, however, HVWC, as authorized by PURA, began to utilize the WRA as of March 31, 2017.
On January 3, 2018, PURA filed a motion to reopen the most recent rate case decisions for the Company’s Connecticut Regulated Companies to determine what, if any, adjustments to rates are appropriate to account for revisions to tax laws, including corporate tax rates, contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”). As discussed below, Connecticut Water has entered into a settlement agreement with the state’s consumer advocate that covers treatment of the Tax Act. On January 11, 2018, the MPUC issued a notice of investigation to determine the impact of the Tax Act on Maine Water. The investigation will allow the MPUC to determine the specific impact of the Tax Act and whether any rate adjustments are warranted. Following discovery, a technical conference is scheduled for April 19, 2018. In addition to determining the impact of the Tax Act on the 
7

justness and reasonableness of Maine Water’s rates, the MPUC will consider whether to issue an accounting order to establish a regulatory liability which defers for future flow-through to ratepayers the impact of the tax changes.
The Heritage Village Water Company Acquisition
As previously reported, on May 10, 2016, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire HVWC, pending a vote of HVWC shareholders, approval by PURA and MPUC and the satisfaction of other various closing conditions, pursuant to the terms of Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May 10, 2016 between and among HVWC, the Company, and HAC, Inc., the Company’s wholly-owned Connecticut subsidiary (the “Merger Agreement”). HVWC serves approximately 4,700 water customers in the Towns of Southbury, Middlebury, and Oxford, Connecticut and approximately 3,000 wastewater customers in the Town of Southbury, Connecticut.
The acquisition was executed through a stock-for-stock merger transaction valued at approximately $16.9 million. Holders of HVWC common stock received shares of the Company’s common stock in a tax-free exchange. In addition, the transaction reflected a total enterprise value of HVWC of approximately $21.5 million, with the $16.9 million paid to shareholders in a stock exchange and the assumption by the Company of approximately $4.6 million of debt held by HVWC at the time of the acquisition.
The Company received regulatory approval from MPUC on September 28, 2016 and from PURA on December 5, 2016, to proceed with the transaction. The shareholders of HVWC voted to approve the acquisition at a special meeting of HVWC’s shareholders held on February 27, 2017.
On February 27, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of HVWC by completing the merger of the Companys’s wholly-owned subsidiary HAC, Inc. with and into HVWC, with HVWC as the surviving corporation, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and Connecticut corporate law. Upon the effective time of the Merger, the holders of HVWC’s 1,620 issued and outstanding shares of common stock became entitled to receive an aggregate of 300,445 shares of the Company’s common stock in a tax-free exchange, which exchange was commenced promptly by the issuance of a letter of transmittal and related materials by Connecticut Water’s exchange agent.
The Avon Water Company Acquisition
As previously reported, on October 12, 2016, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire Avon Water, pending a vote of Avon Water shareholders, approval by PURA and the MPUC and the satisfaction of other various closing conditions, pursuant to the terms of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated October 11, 2016 as amended on March 29, 2017 between and among Avon Water, the Company, and WC-A I, Inc., the Company’s wholly-owned Connecticut subsidiary (the “Merger Agreement”). Avon Water serves approximately 4,800 customers in the Farmington Valley communities of Avon, Farmington, and Simsbury, Connecticut.
On February 10, 2017, Connecticut Water received regulatory approval from MPUC and on April 12, 2017, Connecticut Water received regulatory approval from PURA to proceed with the transaction. The shareholders of Avon Water voted to approve the acquisition at a special meeting of Avon Water’s shareholders held on June 16, 2017.
Effective July 1, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Avon Water by completing the merger of Connecticut Water’s wholly-owned subsidiary WC-A I, Inc. with and into Avon Water, with Avon Water as the surviving corporation, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and Connecticut corporate law. Upon the effective time of the Merger, the holders of Avon Water’s 122,289 issued and outstanding shares of common stock became entitled to receive the following merger consideration for each share of Avon Water common stock held: (i) a cash payment of $50.11; and (ii) a stock consideration component, consisting of 3.97 shares of the Company’s common stock.
The transaction was completed through a stock-for-stock exchange where Avon Water shareholders received the Company’s common stock valued at approximately $26.9 million, in a tax-free exchange, and a cash payment of $6.1 million for a total payment to shareholders of $33.0 million. The transaction reflects a total enterprise value of approximately $39.1 million, with the $33.0 million paid to shareholders and the assumption by the Company of approximately $6.1 million of debt held by Avon Water at the time of acquisition.
Connecticut Rates
Connecticut Water’s Water Infrastructure Conservation Adjustment (“WICA”) was 9.81%, 7.13% and 4.19% above base rates at December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, Avon Water’s WICA surcharge was 8.09%. As of December 31, 2017, HVWC has not filed for a WICA surcharge.

On February 6, 2018, Connecticut Water filed a petition with PURA to reopen Connecticut Water’s 2010 rate case (previously reopened in 2013) proceeding for the limited purpose of approving a Settlement Agreement entered into by Connecticut Water and the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel (“OCC”) (the “Agreement”). The Agreement contemplates a change in Connecticut Water’s customer rates effective for bills rendered on and after April 1, 2018 made up of the following two components: (1) the revenue requirements associated with a $36.3 million addition to rate base to reflect necessary upgrades to Connecticut Water’s Rockville Water Treatment Plant; and (2) the folding in to base rates of the Company’s present WICA surcharges. In addition, the Agreement provides that:

1. | Upon implementation of new rates under the Agreement, until such time as new rates are adopted in a general rate case, through a temporary modification of the earnings sharing mechanism, Connecticut Water customers will receive one hundred percent of any earnings in excess of levels allowed by law rather than limiting such customer credits to 50% as contemplated by applicable law;


2. | Connecticut Water agrees it will not file for a general increase of Connecticut Water’s base rates to be effective before January 1, 2020;


3. | The pending proceeding initiated by PURA in Docket No. 09-12-11RE03, Application of The Connecticut Water Company for Amended Rates – Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act shall be closed; and


4. | Connecticut Water shall continue to make investments in infrastructure replacement consistent with its approved WICA plan. Connecticut Water shall be allowed to continue to pursue recovery of eligible projects through WICA. 

The Agreement provides that, if PURA does not fully approve the Agreement in its entirety, it shall be deemed withdrawn. Accordingly, the Agreement has no operative effect unless and until it is approved by PURA. Connecticut Water is not able to predict with certainty the ultimate timing of PURA’s final action on the Agreement. No assurance can be given that PURA will approve the Agreement and permit some or all of the terms contained in the Agreement requested by the parties. PURA has agreed to the request to reopen the rate proceeding. We expect a decision by the end of the second quarter of 2018 with provisions of the Agreement becoming effective soon thereafter.
Since 2013, Connecticut law has authorized a Water Revenue Adjustment (“WRA”) to reconcile actual water demands with the demands projected in the last general rate case and allows companies to adjust rates as necessary to recover the revenues approved by PURA in the last general rate case. The WRA removes the financial disincentive for water utilities to develop and implement effective water conservation programs. The WRA allows water companies to defer on the balance sheet, as a regulatory asset or liability, for later collection from or crediting to customers the amount by which actual revenues deviate from the revenues allowed in the most recent general rate proceedings, including WICA proceedings. Additionally, projects eligible for WICA surcharges were expanded to include energy conservation projects, improvements required to comply with streamflow regulations, and improvements to acquired systems.
Connecticut Water and HVWC’s allowed revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, as approved by PURA during each company’s last general rate case and including subsequently approved WICA surcharges, were approximately $80.7 million. Through normal billing for the year ended December 31, 2017 operating revenue for Connecticut Water and HVWC would have been approximately $76.4 million had the WRA not been implemented. As a result of the implementation of the WRA, Connecticut Water and HVWC recorded $4.3 million in additional revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, Connecticut Water recorded $1.1 million and $1.6 million, respectively, in additional revenue related to the WRA. Avon Water does not currently use the WRA mechanism.
Maine Rates
In Maine, the overall, approved cumulative Water Infrastructure Charge (“WISC”) for all of Maine Water’s divisions was 5.6%, 4.7% and 1.6% above base rates as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Five pending WISC filings as of December 31, 2017 have since been approved in the first quarter of 2018, bringing the total to 6.9%. The WISC rates for the Biddeford and Saco division were reset to zero with the approval of the general rate increase discussed below.
On June 29, 2017, Maine Water filed for a rate increase in its Biddeford and Saco division. The rate request was for an approximate $1.6 million, or 25.1%, increase in revenues. The rate request is designed to recover higher operating expenses, depreciation and property taxes since Biddeford and Saco’s last rate increase in 2015. Maine Water and the Maine Office of the Public Advocate reached an agreement that increases annual revenue by $1.56 million. The agreement was approved by the MPUC on December 5, 2017, with new rates effective December 1, 2017.
In 2014 and 2015, Maine Water petitioned the MPUC for approval of accounting orders that would address (1) the return to its customers a federal income tax refund stemming from the adoption of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Revenue Procedure 2012-19 (“Repair Regulations”), and (2) the treatment of any benefit resulting from the elimination of deferred tax liabilities previously recorded on these qualifying fixed assets that are now deducted under the Repair Regulations.

On February 26, 2015, the MPUC approved a stipulation between Maine Water and the Office of the Public Advocate that refunds $2.9 million to the customers of the eight divisions over a two-year period starting no later than July 1, 2015, and allows the flow-through treatment of the repair deduction as of January 1, 2014. In addition, Maine Water agreed not to file a general rate case during the two-year refund period in any of the eight divisions that were allowed the refund.
On June 22, 2015, the MPUC approved a settlement agreement between Maine Water and the Office of the Public Advocate that allowed for the amortization of the deferred tax liabilities over a one to nine year period, depending on the division. Maine Water commenced amortization per the agreed upon schedule.
With the completion of these two dockets, Maine Water recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2015 the retroactive benefit associated with the flow-through of the Repair Regulations from January 1, 2014. The 2014 benefit, reflected in the second quarter of 2015, was approximately $931,000, or $0.09 per basic share outstanding.
A water revenue adjustment mechanism law in Maine became available to regulated water utilities in Maine on October 15, 2015. Maine Water is currently precluded from seeking new rates in the Biddeford and Saco division due to provisions in the settlement agreement with the MPUC. As the stay-out periods for other divisions expire, Maine Water expects to request usage of this mechanism as Maine Water file rate cases for those divisions.
Our Water Systems
As of December 31, 2017, our water infrastructure consisted of 77 noncontiguous water systems in the States of Connecticut and Maine.  Our system, in total, consists of approximately 2,300 miles of water main and reservoir storage capacity of 9.4 billion gallons.  The safe, dependable yield from our 249 active wells and 25 surface water supplies is approximately 185 million gallons per day.  Water sources vary among the individual systems, but overall approximately 80% of the total dependable yield comes from surface water supplies and 20% from wells.
For the year-ended December 31, 2017, our Regulated Companies’ 135,645 customers consumed approximately 9.7 billion gallons of water, generating $107,054,000 in operating revenues.  We supply water, and in most cases, fire protection to all or portions of 80 towns throughout Connecticut and Maine.

The Regulated Companies own various small, discrete parcels of land that are no longer required for water supply purposes.  At December 31, 2017, this land totaled over 600 acres.  Over the past several years, we have been disposing of these land parcels through sales and/or donations, primarily to towns and municipalities. For more information, please refer to Segments of Our Business below.
Additional information on land dispositions can be found in Item 7 – “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations – Commitments and Contingencies”.
Competition
Our Regulated Companies face competition from a few small privately-owned water systems operating within, or adjacent to, our franchise areas and from municipal and public authority systems whose service areas in some cases overlap portions of our franchise areas.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we employed a total of 294 people.  Our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Segments of Our Business
For management and financial reporting purposes we divide our business into three segments: Water Operations (our Regulated Companies), Real Estate Transactions (through either our regulated or unregulated companies), and Services and Rentals (our unregulated companies and certain unregulated transactions within Maine Water).
Water Operations – The Water Operations segment is comprised of our core regulated water operations to supply public drinking water and provide wastewater services to our customers.  This segment encompasses all transactions of our Regulated Companies with the exception of certain real estate transactions. More detailed information, including revenues, costs and income taxes associated with the segment can be found in Note 14, “Segment Reporting” in the Company’s “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements”.
Real Estate Transactions – Our Real Estate Transactions segment involves the sale or donation for income tax benefits of our real estate holdings.  These transactions can be effected by any of our subsidiary companies.  Through land donations and sales in previous years, the Company earned tax credits to use in future years.  The Company is limited by time and the amount of taxable income when using these credits.  During 2015, the Company donated land associated with a previously sold land conservation easement in Connecticut and the sale of three small parcels of land in Maine. These transactions generated $349,000 in net income in the Real Estate segment. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company sold a small parcel of land and adjusted previously adjusted tax reserves related to previously completed land sales/donations resulting in a loss of $54,000. During 2017, the Company sold small parcels of land in Connecticut and Maine. These transactions generated $33,000 in net income in the Real Estate segment. Net income from the Real Estate Transactions segment is shown net in the “Other Income (Deductions), Net of Taxes” portion of the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. More detailed information, including revenues, costs and income taxes associated with the segment can be found in Note 14, “Segment Reporting” in the Company’s “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements”.
12

A breakdown of the net income of this segment between our regulated and unregulated companies for the past three years is as follows:

 | (Loss) Income from Real Estate Transactions
 | Regulated | | Unregulated | Total
2017 | $ | 33,000 | | $ | — | $ | 33,000 | 
2016 | $ | (54,000 | ) | $ | — | $ | (54,000 | )
2015 | $ | 349,000 | | $ | — | $ | 349,000 | 

Services and Rentals – Our Services and Rentals segment provides contracted services to water and wastewater utilities and other clients and also leases certain of our properties to third parties through our unregulated companies in the State of Connecticut and through Maine Water in the State of Maine.  The types of services provided include contract operations of water and wastewater facilities; Linebacker®, our service line protection plan for public drinking water customers; and providing bulk deliveries of emergency drinking water to businesses and residences via tanker truck.  Our lease and rental income comes primarily from the renting of residential and commercial property. Net income from the Services and Rentals segment is shown net in the “Other Income (Deductions), Net of Taxes” portion of the Company’s “Consolidated Statements of Income”. More detailed information, including revenues, costs and income taxes associated with the segment can be found in Note 14, “Segment Reporting” in the Company’s “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements”.
Linebacker is an optional service line protection program offered by the Company to eligible residential customers through NEWUS in Connecticut and Maine Water in Maine covering the cost of repairs for leaking or broken water service lines which provide drinking water to a customer’s home. For customers who enroll in this program, the Company will repair or replace a leaking or broken water service line, curb box, curb box cover, meter pit, meter pit cover, meter pit valve plus in-home water main shut off valve before the meter. This was the fifth year that NEWUS has successfully offered expanded coverage to Connecticut Water customers for failure of in-home plumbing, sewer and septic drainage lines and implemented modified terms and conditions with limitations on certain coverages. As of December 31, 2017, NEWUS had approximately 20,000 customers enrolled in its Linebacker protection program and over 35% were enrolled in one of our expanded coverage plans. Depending on the coverage selected, Linebacker prices range between $85 and $185 per year for residential customers. The Company notified Connecticut’s Linebacker customers in February 2018 that their rates will be increasing to between $88 to $190, effective March 1, 2018. Maine Water offers basic service line protection under Linebacker to its customers at a rate of $85. As of December 31, 2017, Maine Water had approximately 2,500 customers enrolled in Linebacker.
Some of the services listed above have limited competition. However, the Company has seen competitors in the service line protection business begin to market to Connecticut Water and Maine Water customers. Additionally, there can be considerable competition for contract operations of large water and wastewater facilities and systems. The Company sought to develop a niche market by attaching our name to service line protection plans and by seeking to serve smaller facilities and systems in our service areas where there is less competition.  The Services and Rentals segment has provided between 5-8% of our overall net income in 2017, 2016, and 2015.  Net income generated by this segment of our business was $1,167,000, $1,219,000 and $1,394,000 for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
