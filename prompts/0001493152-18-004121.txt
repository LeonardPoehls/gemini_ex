ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
IEG Holdings Corporation (“IEG Holdings,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a fintech company that provides unsecured online consumer loans under the brand name “Mr. Amazing Loans” via our website and online application portal at www.mramazingloans.com. Fintech companies, such as IEG Holdings, apply technology to improve financial services. We started our business and opened our first office in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2010. We currently offer $5,000 and $10,000 unsecured consumer loans that mature in five years. We are currently licensed and/or hold certificates of authority and originating direct consumer loans in 20 states – Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin. We provide loans to residents of these states through our online application portal, with all loans originated, processed and serviced out of our centralized Las Vegas head office, which eliminates the need for physical offices in all of these states.
 
Our strategy is to address the market needs of underbanked consumers that tend to be ignored by mainstream institutional credit providers such as banks and credit unions, and charged excessive fees and interest by fringe lenders such as payday lenders. In the current global environment, we believe there is a substantial need and opportunity for the small personal loans we offer.
 
All of our personal loans are offered at prevailing statutory rates with fixed affordable repayments and no prepayment penalties. We conduct full underwriting on all applications including credit checks and review of bank statements to ensure customers have capacity to repay their loans, and have designed our loans to help customers reach a stronger financial position.
 
OneMain Tender Offer
 
On January 5, 2017, we launched a tender offer for shares of OneMain Holdings, Inc. (“OneMain”) common stock (the “OneMain Tender Offer”). In our tender offer materials relating to the OneMain Tender Offer, we indicated that we intended to use our OneMain stockholdings to become an activist investor, to pressure OneMain to transform its “brick and mortar” business model to our online-only distribution business model. The OneMain Tender Offer was undersubscribed, with stockholders representing approximately 0.1% of OneMain’s outstanding shares tendering their shares. On June 16, 2017, IEG Holdings closed the OneMain Tender Offer, with 151,994 OneMain shares of common stock acquired (valued at an aggregate of $3.6 million based on the closing price of shares of OneMain common stock of $23.38 on June 15, 2017) in exchange for 3,039,880 shares of IEG Holdings’ common stock.
 
On June 16, 2017, we sent a letter to OneMain’s Chief Executive Officer and board of directors with the following activist stockholder demands:
 

● | Appoint Mr. Mathieson as an IEG Holdings representative on OneMain’s board of directors, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Appoint Mr. Mathieson as an IEG Holdings representative on OneMain’s management team, 
● | Implement substantial cost cuts, and 
● | Implement a new and improved online strategy. 

 
We indicated in our letter that we intended, in our role as an activist investor, to:
 

● | Encourage OneMain to transform the OneMain “brick and mortar” business model to IEG Holdings’ 100% online-only distribution business model, which IEG Holdings believes could result in estimated cost savings of at least $700 million per year by closing over 1,700 OneMain offices, terminating over 10,000 employees, and achieving substantial cuts in advertising/marketing costs and other significant cost-cutting measures, including a significant reduction in aggregate annual executive compensation, and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Encourage OneMain to improve its business from termination of low margin OneMain business segments with a new focus on high margin unsecured loans to near prime clients, a focus on refinancing of existing high quality OneMain customers and termination of lending to subprime OneMain customers with FICO scores of less than 600 to reduce OneMain’s loss levels. 

 
This was the only contact that IEG Holdings had with OneMain following expiration of the OneMain Tender Offer. On June 22, 2017, the fifth business day following termination of the OneMain Tender Offer, IEG Holdings sold 100% of its OneMain shares (an aggregate of 151,994 shares, which represented approximately 0.1% of OneMain’s outstanding shares) in exchange for approximately $3.4 million in cash due to lack of response from OneMain’s management, an undersubscribed tender offer and what management believed, based on the low level of tendering stockholders, to be a lack of OneMain stockholder support for the proposed business changes. Had management perceived greater OneMain stockholder support for the proposed business changes or OneMain management demonstrated a willingness to enter into discussions, IEG Holdings likely would have considered retaining its stake in OneMain for a longer period of time or indefinitely. The sale of the tendered OneMain shares by IEG Holdings significantly increased IEG Holdings’ capital and net asset value and resulted in a substantial increase in lending in the third and fourth quarters ending December 31, 2017. Despite IEG Holdings’ desire to effect changes in OneMain’s management, IEG Holdings did not include a minimum tender condition in its offer because IEG Holdings determined that the acquisition of any OneMain shares under the OneMain Tender Offer could add stockholder value by increasing IEG Holdings’ capital and net asset value.

On July 1, 2017, we and our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Paul Mathieson who is also the sole member of our Board of Directors, agreed to terminate, effective July 1, 2017, the consulting contract dated January 1, 2017 between our Chief Executive Officer and the Company pursuant to which the Company was required to pay Mr. Mathieson $1 annually in exchange for certain consulting services. Concurrently with the termination of that consulting contract, IEC, and Mr. Mathieson entered into a new professional consulting contract, effective as of July 1, 2017 (the “Professional Consulting Contract”). Pursuant to the terms of the Professional Consulting Contract, Mr. Mathieson agreed to provide regulatory and management consulting services as requested by the Company and/or IEC. The Professional Consulting Contract has a term of 1.5 years and renews automatically for successive one-year periods unless notice of termination is provided 30 days prior to the automatic renewal date. In exchange for the services provided to the Company and/or IEC by our Chief Executive Officer, IEC agreed to pay him $1,200,000 annually in quarterly payments of $300,000 due in advance each quarter and to provide health insurance benefits as well as a discretionary bonus to be determined by the Company’s Board of Directors, which consists solely of Mr. Mathieson.
 
Following the sale of the OneMain shares acquired in the OneMain Tender Offer, we have started to use, and expect to continue to use, the proceeds from the sale to fund increased new loan volumes and to pay Mr. Mathieson, our Chief Executive Officer and the sole member of our board of directors, amounts owed pursuant to the terms of his Professional Consulting Contract. The Professional Consulting Contract obligates us to pay Mr. Mathieson $1.2 million annually, plus health insurance and a discretionary bonus to be determined by our sole director. Beginning on July 1, 2018, the July 2017 Consulting Contract will be replaced with a new consulting contract. See “—Recent Developments—Professional Consulting Contract.”

July 2017 Lending Club Tender Offer
 
On July 12, 2017, the Company filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (the “S-4 Registration Statement”) and a Schedule TO relating to the Company’s offer to exchange four shares of the Company’s common stock for each share of the common stock of LendingClub Corporation (“Lending Club”), par value $0.01 per share, up to an aggregate of 40,345,603 shares of Lending Club’s common stock, representing approximately 9.99% of the outstanding shares of Lending Club’s common stock as of April 28, 2017, validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in the offer (the “2017 Lending Club Tender Offer”). The 2017 Lending Club Tender Offer and the withdrawal rights were set to expire at 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on August 10, 2017, unless extended.
 
Following the launch of the 2017 Lending Club Tender Offer, the price per share of the Company’s common stock, as quoted on the OTCQB, dropped significantly. On August 1, 2017, due to the drop in the Company’s stock price, the Company determined that the 2017 Lending Club Tender Offer no longer had a reasonable chance of success and accordingly, the Company determined that it would terminate the 2017 Lending Club Tender Offer and withdraw the S-4 Registration Statement. Any shares that were tendered by Lending Club stockholders were not accepted and were returned to the relevant stockholders. From time to time, the Company may consider a future tender offer where it identifies either business or investment opportunities.
 
2016 Reverse and Forward Stock Splits
 
IEG Holdings has executed and initiated reverse stock splits that have resulted in a reduction in the number of stockholders of IEG Holdings and certain stockholders were involuntarily cashed out. In April 2016 and October 2016, we effected reverse and forward stock splits. In each case, stockholders who would otherwise have received fractional shares received cash in exchange for shares of IEG Holdings. These stockholders were involuntarily cashed out, and the splits were approved by Mr. Mathieson in his capacity as our sole director. The stockholders that were involuntarily cashed out were cashed out at a higher per share price than the current per share price. Accordingly, the effects of changes in our stock price were positive for such stockholders, as they could choose to repurchase shares at a lower cost per share. As our largest stockholder, sole officer and director, Mr. Mathieson can exercise sole authority over any future reverse stock splits, including the existence of and terms of any reverse stock splits, that could result in stockholders being involuntarily cashed out. Our stockholders should be willing to entrust all aspects of our management to Mr. Mathieson.
 
Abandonment of Reverse-Forward Stock Split and Cash-Out
 
On June 21, 2017, the Company filed with the SEC a preliminary information statement on Schedule 14C (the “Preliminary Information Statement”). The Preliminary Information Statement, though not in definitive form, related to a vote by the Company’s sole director and holder of a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company to effect a reverse 1-for-1,000 stock split (the “Reverse Split”), followed immediately by a forward 1,000-for-1 stock split (the “Forward Split”) of the Company’s common stock. The Company’s intention was that registered stockholders whose shares of the Company’s common stock were converted into less than one share in the Reverse Split would receive cash payments equal to the fair value of those fractional interests. The Reverse Split and Forward Split, together with the related cash payments to stockholders with less than 1,000 shares of the Company’s common stock prior to the Reverse Split are referred to herein as the “Reverse/Forward Split.”

-

 

The primary goal of the Reverse/Forward Split was cost savings from reducing administrative costs associated with stockholder accounts, and the Company believes that previously completed reverse/forward stock splits have achieved substantial administrative cost savings. Neither the Reverse/Forward Split nor any reverse/forward stock split previously completed by the Company were designed for the purposes of or in connection with a “going private” transaction. The board of directors and controlling stockholder approved the Reverse/Forward Split on June 14, 2017, which was the day before the expiration of the tender offer for shares of OneMain common stock. The board did not believe the decision to take corporate action to effect the split was a material change to the OneMain Tender Offer as it would have only potentially impacted up to eight of the OneMain stockholders who had accepted the offer who held less than 1,000 IEG Holdings shares if they still owned their shares on July 25, 2017. Even if they did still own their shares on July 25, 2017, they would have been provided notice from the Information Statement and could have purchased a small number of extra shares to avoid being repurchased if they did not want to sell or they could have sold on the market at a higher price in the days after the OneMain Tender Offer closed and the Information Statement was filed. The total amount of the repurchase would have been approximately $100,000, would have impacted almost exclusively non-OneMain tendering stockholders and represents a non-material amount of IEG Holdings’ total assets. The total amount of less than $8,000 for the eight affected OneMain tendering stockholders compared to the approximately $3.55 million worth of OneMain shares acquired in the OneMain Tender Offer is not material. The board believes that the cost savings from the proposed Reverse/Forward Split, though not material, would have been a positive for the OneMain tendering stockholders if it had been effected.
 
On July 21, 2017, the Company announced that it would not effect the Reverse/Forward Split and instructed holders of the Company’s common stock to disregard the Preliminary Information Statement that was filed with the SEC in its entirety. The Company’s determination to abandon the Reverse/Forward Split was based on the Company’s launch, on July 12, 2017, of the 2017 Lending Club Tender Offer subsequent to the filing of the Preliminary Information Statement with the SEC on June 21, 2017. The Company expected that a significant number of individual new stockholders could acquire less than 1,000 shares of the Company’s common stock in connection with the 2017 Lending Club Tender Offer which could have significantly increased the cost of completing the Reverse/Forward Split. For the avoidance of doubt, no reverse and/or forward split occurred on July 25, 2017 and no stockholders were cashed out on July 25, 2017. The Company has no intention of effecting the Reverse/Forward Split or any other reverse and/or forward split in the near future.
 
Stock Repurchase Program
 
In January 2017, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the open market repurchase of up to $2,000,000 of our common stock for the following reasons:

● | The stock repurchase program permits the Company to purchase shares of its common stock from time to time at prices that are below what the Board believes to be the true value of the shares. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Company’s common stock is trading at close to record low prices. 
● | The stock repurchase program reflects the commitment of our Board of Directors to enhance stockholder value and its confidence in our long-term growth prospects. 
● | The Board believes the stock repurchase program is a strategic investment and an appropriate use of corporate funds. 
● | Any repurchases will only be effected to the extent that they do not impair the Company’s capital or the Company’s ability to pay its debts. 
● | The Company has available liquidity from existing customer loan repayments to be able to both reinvest in new customer loans and also to strategically invest back into our company via stock repurchases. 
● | The stock repurchase program will assist in improving stock liquidity and ensuring a more orderly and less volatile market for a relatively small outlay of cash. 
● | No purchases are required. 

 
Purchases under the program are authorized through December 31, 2018. As at the close of business on March 28, 2018, 458,973 shares have been repurchased to date under this program.

Declaration of Dividends
 
In May 2017, our sole director declared a cash dividend of $0.005 per common share for the first quarter of 2017. The dividend was paid on August 21, 2017 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 5, 2017. On August 1, 2017, our sole director declared a cash dividend of $0.005 per common share for the second quarter of 2017. The dividend was paid on August 21, 2017 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 11, 2017. On October 30, 2017, we declared a cash dividend of $0.005 per common share for the third quarter of 2017. The dividend was paid on November 20, 2017 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 11, 2017.
Notes Offering Terminated
 
In December 2016, we launched a private offering of up to $10 million aggregate principal amount of our 12% senior unsecured notes due December 31, 2026 (the “Notes”), on a self-underwritten basis. The Notes offering was terminated in May 2017. No Notes were sold in the offering.
OneMain Holdings, Inc. Tender Offer Closed
 
On June 16, 2017, we closed the OneMain Tender Offer, pursuant to which we acquired 151,994 shares of the common stock of OneMain (valued at an aggregate of approximately $3.55 million based on the closing price of the shares of OneMain’s common stock of $23.38 on June 15, 2017) in exchange for 3,039,880 shares of the Company’s common stock. The per share valuation of the Company’s common stock used as consideration in the OneMain Tender Offer was $1.169 per share at the closing date of the OneMain Tender Offer. On June 22, 2017, we sold 100% of the 151,994 shares of the common stock of OneMain, which we obtained in the OneMain Tender Offer, on the open market in exchange for $3.4 million in cash. We have begun to use and expect to continue to use the proceeds from the sale of those shares of the common stock of OneMain to fund increased new loan volumes in the second half of 2017 and to pay our Chief Executive Officer and the sole member of our Board of Directors amounts owed pursuant to the terms of the professional consulting contract, effective as of July 1, 2017, between IEC and our Chief Executive Officer.
Amendment of Series H Preferred Stock
 
On June 20, 2017, we filed articles of amendment (the “June 20 Amendment”) to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended (the “Articles”) with the Florida Secretary of State. The June 20 Amendment has the effect of revising the terms of our Series H preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series H Preferred Stock”) to:

(1) | remove rights to receive dividends on our Series H preferred stock; 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | increase the conversion ratio of the Series H preferred stock from 0.2 shares of Common Stock per share of Series H preferred stock to 1 share of Common Stock per share of Series H preferred stock; 
(3) | remove our right to redeem or call our Series H preferred stock; 
(4) | provide for automatic conversion of Series H preferred stock into shares of our Common Stock on December 31, 2017; and 
(5) | remove the voting rights for Series H preferred stock. 

 
The Amendment was approved by our board of directors on June 19, 2017.
 
In addition, on July 26, 2017, we filed additional articles of amendment (the “July 26 Amendment”) to our Articles that had the effect of further revising the terms of the Series H Preferred Stock to increase the conversion ratio of the Series H Preferred Stock from one share of our common stock per share of the Series H Preferred Stock to four shares of our common stock per share of the Series H Preferred Stock, which may dilute the value of our common stock.
 
The June 20 Amendment and the July 26 Amendment were approved by our Board of Directors on June 19, 2017 and July 26, 2017, respectively.
 
Resale Registration Statement Filing
 
On August 31, 2017, the SEC declared effective the resale registration statement (the “Resale Registration Statement”) filed by the Company on Form S-1 relating to the sale by certain selling stockholders of an aggregate of 9,089,220 shares of the Company’s common stock at a fixed price set by the Company of $3.00 per share. The shares of our common stock registered pursuant to the Resale Registration Statement represent approximately 52% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of March 28, 2018. All 6,900,000 shares of our common stock held by our Chief Executive Officer who is also the sole member of our Board of Directors and holds 39.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, were registered for resale under the Resale Registration Statement. The actual value of shares of our common stock may be significantly less than the offering price of $3.00 per share. If the selling stockholders, including our Chief Executive Officer and sole director, sell the shares of our common stock registered under the Resale Registration Statement on the open market, the market price of the Company’s common stock may decline significantly.

Professional Consulting Contract
 
On July 1, 2017, we and our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Paul Mathieson who is also the sole member of our Board of Directors, agreed to terminate, effective July 1, 2017, the consulting contract dated January 1, 2017 between our Chief Executive Officer and the Company pursuant to which the Company was required to pay Mr. Mathieson $1 annually in exchange for certain consulting services. Concurrently with the termination of that consulting contract, IEC and Mr. Mathieson entered into a new Professional Consulting Contract, effective as of July 1, 2017. Pursuant to the terms of the Professional Consulting Contract, our Chief Executive Officer agreed to provide regulatory and management consulting services as requested by the Company and/or IEC. The Professional Consulting Contract has a term of 1.5 years and renews automatically for successive one-year periods unless notice of termination is provided 30 days prior to the automatic renewal date. In exchange for the services provided to the Company and/or IEC by our Chief Executive Officer, IEC agreed to pay him $1,200,000 annually in quarterly payments of $300,000 due in advance each quarter and to provide health insurance benefits as well as a discretionary bonus to be determined by the Company’s Board of Directors, which consists solely of Mr. Mathieson.
 
On March 22, 2018, we entered into a new professional consulting contract with Mr. Mathieson (the “2018 Consulting Contract”) and terminated the July 2017 Consulting Contract, effective July 1, 2018. Pursuant to the terms of the 2018 Consulting Contract, Mr. Mathieson agreed to provide regulatory and management consulting services as requested by IEG Holdings and/or IEC, including the hiring and compensation of IEC personnel, interaction with third party service providers and vendors and, as requested by IEG Holdings, other activities that are designed to assist IEC in conducting business. The term of the 2018 Consulting Contract begins as of July 1, 2018 continues indefinitely unless three months’ written notice of termination is provided by either party.
 
In exchange for Mr. Mathieson’s services, IEG Holdings agreed to pay Mr. Mathieson an annual base salary of $600,000, which represents a 50% reduction in Mr. Mathieson’s annual salary, as compared to his current annual salary of $1,200,000 payable under Mr. Mathieson’s consulting contract currently in effect (the “2017 Consulting Contract”). Pursuant to the terms of the 2018 Consulting Contract, no bonus is to be paid to Mr. Mathieson by IEG Holdings. Pursuant to the terms of the 2018 Consulting Contract, fees are to be paid quarterly in advance on July 1st, October 1st, January 1st and April 1st beginning on July 1, 2018. Unlike in prior years, IEG Holdings will not pay Mr. Mathieson’s health insurance premiums or any bonuses. Mr. Mathieson will also receive reimbursement for all reasonable expenses incurred for the benefit of IEC, including but not limited to travel expenses for him and his entourage, hotel expenses, communication, security and entertainment expenses.
 
IEG Holdings expects that, beginning in the third quarter of 2018, its salary and compensation operating expense will be substantially reduced as a result of entry into the 2018 Consulting Contract.


Series H Preferred Stock Issuances & Conversions
 
On October 30, 2017, the Company completed a private placement of 934,589 shares of the Series H Preferred Stock to four non-U.S. persons. The Company received an aggregate purchase price of $934,589 for the sale of the shares of Series H Preferred Stock and intends to use the proceeds from that sale to expand its operations, including through increased advertising designed to increase the amount and number of loans entered into with customers and to fund operations of the Company. The issuance of shares of Series H Preferred Stock was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act in reliance upon Regulation S promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act.
 
On December 15, 2017, the Company completed a private placement of 305,000 shares of Series H Preferred Stock to three non-U.S. persons. The Company received an aggregate purchase price of $305,000 for the sale of the shares of Series H Preferred Stock and intends to use the proceeds from that sale to expand its operations, including through increased advertising designed to increase the amount and number of loans entered into with customers and to fund operations of the Company.

On December 28, 2017, the Company completed a private placement of 52,500 shares of Series H Preferred Stock to two non-U.S. persons. The Company received an aggregate purchase price of $52,500 for the sale of the shares of Series H Preferred Stock and intends to use the proceeds from that sale to expand its operations, including through increased advertising designed to increase the amount and number of loans entered into with customers and to fund operations of the Company. The issuance of shares of Series H Preferred Stock was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act in reliance upon Regulation S promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act.

On December 31, 2017, the holders of an aggregate of 1,292,089 shares of Series H preferred stock, representing all of the outstanding Series H Preferred Shares, pursuant to the terms of the Series H Preferred Shares, converted their shares of Series H Preferred Shares, effective December 31, 2017. In accordance with the terms of the Series H Preferred Shares, upon the conversion of such Series H Preferred Shares, the Company issued to the converting holders of Series H Preferred Shares an aggregate of 5,168,356 shares of the Company’s common stock. As a result of the conversion, no Series H Preferred Shares are outstanding. In addition, as a result of the conversion and subsequent issuance of common stock, 17,463,449 shares of the Company’s common stock are issued and outstanding. Due solely to the issuance of common stock, and not as the result of any stock disposition, Paul Mathieson, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is no longer a majority stockholder. Following the issuance of common stock, Mr. Mathieson owns approximately 39.5% of the Company’s outstanding common stock.
 
2018 Lending Club Tender Offer

On February 20, 2018, we terminated and withdrew the 2018 Lending Club Tender Offer due to a comment that we received from the SEC raising a concern that the 2018 Lending Club Tender Offer was improperly commenced. Any shares that were tendered by Lending Club stockholders were not accepted by us and were promptly returned to the relevant stockholders.
Corporate Name Change to Mr. Amazing Loans Corporation
 
On March 26, 2018, we filed articles of amendment (the “Amendment”) to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended (the “Articles”) with the Florida Secretary of State. The Amendment has the effect of changing our corporate name from IEG Holdings Corporation to Mr. Amazing Loans Corporation, in order to align our consumer brand (Mr. Amazing Loans) with our corporate name. The Amendment was approved by Mr. Mathieson, our Chief Executive Officer and sole director, and by holders of a majority of the voting power of our voting stock. In connection with the approval of the Amendment by holders of a majority of the voting power of our voting stock, we filed a preliminary information statement on Schedule 14C with the SEC on March 21, 2018. The Amendment and the corporate name change will become effective on the later of (a) the date on which the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority approves the corporate name change, and (b) April 30, 2018; provided, however, that prior to effectiveness of the corporate name change, we must first (i) file a definitive information statement on Schedule 14C with the SEC, which we expect will occur on or about April 2, 2018, (ii) mail copies of the information statement to our stockholders, and (iii) wait at least 20 days from the mailing of the information statement to our stockholders.
Control of IEG Holdings Rests with Mr. Mathieson
 
As our largest stockholder, sole officer and director, Mr. Mathieson will have the right to make all decisions with respect to our management. Mr. Mathieson can exercise sole authority over the direction of IEG Holdings, and any future reverse stock splits that could result in stockholders being involuntarily cashed out.

Investment Company Act of 1940

If we were deemed to be an investment company under the 1940 Act, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Under Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the 1940 Act, an issuer of securities will generally fit the definition of an “investment company” for purposes of the 1940 Act if (i) it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities or (ii) is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of issuing face-amount installment certificates or has any of this type of certificate outstanding. In addition, issuers who do not otherwise fit the definition of an investment company are sometimes deemed to be investment companies, under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the 1940 Act, if the value of their investment securities exceeds 40% of their total assets.
 
Although an issuer may fall within the definition of an “investment company” under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the 1940 Act, the issuer may qualify for an exemption from the definition. Rule 3a-1 under the 1940 Act provides an exemption from the definition of investment company if, on a consolidated basis with its wholly owned subsidiaries, nor more than 45% of its net income after taxes for the last four quarters is derived from securities other than government securities and securities of majority owned subsidiaries and companies primarily controlled by it. As of December 31, 2017, we calculated both our percentage of investment security assets (securities other than government securities, employee companies and certain subsidiaries and affiliates) to total assets and our total percentage of investment income (income from investment securities) as compared to total income to be below the Rule 3a-1 45% thresholds.
 
We were able to maintain our compliance with the 1940 Act because we regularly monitor our status under the 1940 Act and conduct prudential analyses in accordance with the 1940 Act and the SEC’s interpretations thereof. We conduct such analyses on a consolidated basis with our wholly owned subsidiaries to determine whether the thresholds set out in Rule 3a-1 are exceeded. As a result, we do not believe that we should be regulated as an “investment company,” as such term is defined in the 1940 Act, and we intend to conduct our operations to maintain this status. However, if we were to be deemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Market
 
We operate in the consumer finance industry serving the growing population of consumers who have limited access to credit from banks, credit card companies and other lenders. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 7.7% (1 in 13) of households in the United States were unbanked in 2013. This proportion represented nearly 9.6 million households. According to the Center for Financial Services December 2015 report, the rapid rise of short-term credit, which grew 37% from 2012 to 2014, while single payment credit grew only 0.1% over the same period, is starkly apparent. With anticipated regulatory changes likely to alter the feasibility of offering loans due in one lump sum, many companies are investing more heavily in installment-based credit products, while new players are seeking to upend the economics of small-dollar loans through online channels and alternative underwriting. The strong marketing and new account approval rates of subprime credit cards have also provided consumers with increased access to funds available on a short-term basis. Together, these shifts in the consumer lending industry suggest that total revenue for short-term credit products, estimated at $29 billion in 2014, may outpace that of single payment credit products, estimated at $38 billion for the same year. Short-term credit products generate nearly twice as much annual revenue as single payment credit products.
 
Installment lending to non-prime consumers is one of the most highly fragmented sectors of the consumer finance industry. We are a state-licensed Internet-based personal loan company serving in the consumer installment lending industry. Our online lending platform provides the distribution network to efficiently address this growing market of consumers without the significant costs and overhead associated with an extensive branch network. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the significant growth and expansion opportunity created by the continued shift of consumers to online services, such as online banking and in our case online personal loans.

Business Strategy
 
Our business strategy is to lower the cost of providing consumer loans by leveraging our online lending platform and distribution network to enable further loan book growth and portfolio diversification. Our strategy includes a number of key elements:

● | State-Licensed Model: Our state-licensed business model is a key element of our business strategy. We are currently licensed in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Online Distribution: We launched online lending in March 2013 and commenced online advertising in July 2013. Upon fulfillment of state regulatory requirements, we received approval from regulators in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin to operate solely online in these states. This allows us to fully service all 20 states from our centralized Las Vegas headquarters, which we believe is a key competitive advantage over brick and mortar lenders. 
● | Cost-Effective Customer Acquisition: Our customer acquisition costs have been reduced since we launched online lending and marketing. 
● | Continue to Grow Loan Book: Total cumulative loan originations as of December 31, 2017 have increased 192% to $16,209,023 since our January 1, 2015 total of $5,549,023. We believe this growth in lending is attributable to launching online lending and joint venturing with a number of new marketing partners, however, such past growth is not necessarily indicative or predictive of our future results of operation. 
● | Strategic Acquisitions: We have reviewed, and continue to review, opportunities to expand our business through acquisition or merger in the consumer finance sector. We are pursuing opportunities that provide synergies with our existing business and specifically target potential acquisitions that are significantly accretive to stockholder equity and/or provide significant revenue growth opportunities via a minority or majority shareholding. 

 
On December 22, 2017, we announced that we had formed a wholly owned subsidiary to explore the legalities and economic risks and benefits of entering into a joint venture with IEC to accept repayment of customer loans in the form of existing crypto/blockchain currencies, provide the crypto equivalent of $5,000 and $10,000 loans to customers, and also potentially create and issue an IEC cryptocurrency. The company did not begin operations and was in the development planning stages. On March 14, 2018, we announced that, after considering the potential risks and benefits, we will not pursue a cryptocurrency offering or any other cryptocurrency-related ventures at this time. We will continue to monitor the developing regulatory landscape surrounding this new technology and may consider cryptocurrency opportunities in the future. In addition, we will continue to explore the potential application of blockchain technology to our core consumer lending business.

Competitive Strengths
 
We believe our competitive strengths are:
 

● | Market and Scope for Growth: Large personal and payday loan market in the United States presents opportunity for growth and expansion. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Regulation: We are materially compliant with state lending licenses in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin, and are well positioned for current and future regulatory changes due to ongoing compliance and conservative business model. 
● | Customer Proposition: Our unsecured $5,000 and $10,000 installment loans are all offered over five years and feature affordable weekly repayments. Rates range from 12.0% - 29.9% APR which make us a low-cost alternative to payday loans which have an average APR of over 400%. 
● | Online Distribution: Special approval has been granted by the Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin regulators to operate our business without a physical office location in each state. As a result, we have closed offices in Arizona, Illinois and Florida and moved to full online loan distribution, enabling us to offer loans to residents in all 20 of our licensed states from our Las Vegas headquarters. 
● | Customer Acquisition: We launched online advertising in July 2013 with positive results from search engine cost per click advertising and online lead generation. In addition, we engaged a number of new marketing partners in 2014, 2015 and 2016, including online lead generators and direct mail. All of these avenues provide opportunities for strong growth at low customer acquisition costs. 
● | Barriers to Entry: We believe that state licensure acts as a barrier to entry into our segment of the consumer loan market. We are strongly positioned with approval to operate under 20 state licenses from one centralized head office. 

Products
 
We currently provide $5,000 and $10,000 online consumer loans unsecured over a five-year term with rates ranging from 12.0% to 29.9% annual percentage rate. Our current loan portfolio also includes loans remaining from our previous product offerings which were $2,000 to $10,000 loans unsecured over a three- to five-year term at 12.0% to 29.9%.
 
Our personal loan products are fully amortizing, fixed rate, unsecured installment loans and all loans are offered at prevailing statutory rates, with our standard loan product being a 29.9% interest rate and annual percentage rate, fully amortizing, five-year unsecured personal loan. The variations from this standard loan product in certain states is due to individual state requirements and to comply with our state lending licenses; for example, Florida requires a blended rate which caps the maximum rate on a $5,000 loan at 24%.

We commenced originating personal loans online in July 2013. Prior to that, we provided loans to customers via our office network, which comprised one office in each state as required by state licensing regulations. Our online loan origination platform now means that a qualifying customer can obtain a loan from us without having to come into an office location. We have maintained our full underwriting processes, identity verifications and fraud checks to ensure that online customers are verified to the same degree that customers were when they obtained a loan in an office. We expect our website and application portal, www.mramazingloans.com, to be a key driver of customer conversions and loan book growth.
 
The following graphs depict our monthly loan origination values from January 2013 through December 2017 and our yearly revenue for 2013 through 2017:

Customer Acquisition
 
Since launching online lending in July 2013, our marketing efforts have been focused on online customer acquisition. We saw increases in loan applications and inquiries as a result of search engine advertising and commenced banner advertising, remarketing and search engine optimization in 2014. We commenced online video advertising in 2015. We have also engaged numerous online lead generators who provide personal loan leads on a daily basis with a combination of cost per funded loan and cost per application expense. We are continuing to develop relationships with additional lead generation partners to drive further growth. We also supplement our online marketing efforts with traditional direct mail advertising.

New loan volume slowed in the first half of 2017 due to Company capital constraints and reduced advertising. New loan volume increased in the second half of 2017 due to increased available Company capital and increased advertising. However, the increased level of principal reductions from cash collections and once-off Virginia loan principal reductions due to legal settlements resulted in a reduction in the loans receivable balance to $6,160,881 as at December 31, 2017 compared to $7,587,349 at December 31, 2016.

In the third and fourth quarters of 2017 we focused on providing new loans to customers in the states with an average yield of 29.9% to maximize our portfolio yield. The advertising strategy resulted in an increase in the average portfolio yield in 2017 compared to 2016.

Customer Acquisition Costs
 
Since launching online lending in 2013, our marketing efforts have been focused on online customer acquisition. We experienced increases in loan applications and inquiries as a result of search engine advertising and commenced banner advertising, remarketing and search engine optimization in 2014. We commenced online video advertising in 2015. We have also engaged numerous online lead generators who provide personal loan leads on a daily basis with a combination of cost per funded loan and cost per application expense. We are continuing to develop relationships with additional lead generation partners to drive further growth. We also supplement our online marketing efforts with traditional direct mail advertising.
 
The following table shows the level of advertising cost versus the level of loan volume in 2016 and 2017 as both a dollar amount and as a percentage of loan volume for the relevant year. The advertising cost represents both general advertising/brand awareness costs as well as direct fees paid to lead generators and direct mail costs. Although it potentially overstates the direct cost of customer acquisition in a particular year it provides a guide to the general cost and trends in customer acquisition costs. In addition, the customer cost of acquisition is upfront, whereas the revenue from the customer is typically realized 5 years later and for repeat customers, even later.
 

Origination Year | Loan Volume | | Advertising Cost | | | Cost of Acquisition 
---------------------+-----------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+---+---------+-------------------------------------------------------------
2016 | $ | 3,120,000 | | $ | 373,350 | | 12.0 | %
2017 | $ | 2,105,000 | | $ | 407,760 | | 19.4 | %

 
In 2017 there was a substantial increase in advertising expenses as a percentage of new loans funded in the year as a significant direct mail campaign targeting new customers was conducted with more competition from competitors for new loans. However, enhancements have been made to the Company’s internal underwriting procedures and process in early 2018 that management believe should result in a reduction in the cost of customer acquisition in 2018 to substantially less than 2017 levels.
 
Gross Charge-off Ratio and Recovery Ratio
 
The credit quality of our loans is driven by our underwriting criteria, which takes into account income, money management, credit history, employment history and willingness and capacity to repay the proposed loan. The profitability of our loan portfolio is directly connected to net credit losses; therefore, we closely analyze credit performance. We also monitor recovery rates because of their contribution to the reduction in the severity of our charge-offs. Additionally, because delinquencies are an early indicator of future net credit losses, we analyze delinquency trends, adjusting for seasonality, to determine whether or not our loans are performing in line with our original estimates. Because loan volume and portfolio size determine the magnitude of the impact of each of the above factors on our earnings, we also closely monitor origination volume and annual percentage rate.
 
The table below sets forth information regarding the gross charge-off ratio and the recovery ratio in both dollar amounts and in terms of a ratio versus outstanding loans receivable balance. The data is presented for each quarter in 2016 and 2017, for each of the full years for 2016 and 2017.
 

Date | Loans Receivable Balance ($) | | Average Balance ($) Quarterly | | Charge-Offs ($) Quarterly | Ratio (%) Quarterly | Average Balance ($) Annual | | Charge-Offs ($) Annual | | Ratio (%) Annual | Recovery ($) Annual | Recovery (%) Annual |

We saw a slight increase in charge-off ratio in 2017 versus 2016 as we saw an increasing trend in customer hardship and more customers utilizing external debt management services. We significantly increased our level of loss recoveries in both dollar amount and percentage of loans receivable balance due to more internal resources being allocated to the task, combined with a larger pool of losses to recover funds from.

At December 31, 2017, we had 86 loans delinquent or in default (defined as 91+ days past due), representing 5.32% of the number of loans in our active portfolio. Loans become eligible for the lender to take legal action at 60 days past due. At December 31, 2017, our delinquency percentage rate for past due loans was 9.26% (31+ days) with an allowance for loan loss at 20.00%.



Delinquency Summary | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

At December 31, 2016, we had 83 loans delinquent or in default (defined as 91+ days past due), representing 4.84% of the number of loans in our active portfolio. Loans become eligible for the lender to take legal action at 60 days past due. At December 31, 2016, our delinquency percentage rate for past due loans was 10.39% (31+ days) with an allowance for loan loss at 16.00%. There was an increase in the delinquency ratio from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 due to an increasing trend in customer hardship, combined with a fall in loans receivables principal outstanding.
 
Allowance for Credit Losses Ratio
 
Management exercises its judgment, based on quantitative analyses, qualitative factors, such as recent delinquency and other credit trends, and experience in the consumer finance industry, when determining the amount of the allowance for loan receivable losses. We adjust the amounts for management’s estimate of the effects of events and conditions such as changes to underwriting criteria, portfolio seasoning, and current economic conditions, including levels of unemployment, and personal bankruptcies.
 
The allowance for credit losses ratio (reserve level) was increased from 16% for 2016 to 20% for 2017. The net loan balance decreased from $6,374,908 at December 31, 2016 to $4,928,704 at December 31, 2017. The net loan balance at the current reserve level of 20% is $4,928,704 at December 31, 2017.
 
There was no change in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses in the twelve months of 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no material changes in international, national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments in the twelve months of 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 that affected the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments other than increased customer hardship. During 2017 there was no significant change in the nature of the loan portfolio and was a decrease in the average size of the loan portfolio. There were no changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. There was a decrease in the volume and severity of past due loans and the volume of non-accrual loans due to a smaller loan portfolio for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. No changes were made to the quality of our loan review system in the twelve months ended December 2017. There was no significant effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in our loan portfolio in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.

Contractual Loan Maturity
 
The following table shows, as of December 31, 2017, the aggregate principal amount of loans by maturity date.
 

Loans Maturing | Current Principal | | Maturing
-------------------+-----------------------+-----------+---------
Within 1 year | $ | 31,482 | | 0.51 | %
Within 2 years | $ | 805,358 | | 13.07 | %
Within 3 years | $ | 1,661,511 | | 26.97 | %
Within 4 years | $ | 1,694,940 | | 27.51 | %
Within 5 years | $ | 1,967,589 | | 31.94 | %
TOTAL | $ | 6,160,881 | | | 

 
The following table shows, as of December 31, 2016, the aggregate principal amount of loans by maturity date.
 

Loans Maturing | Current Principal | | Maturing
-------------------+-----------------------+-----------+---------
Within 1 year | $ | 8,356 | | 0.11 | %
Within 2 years | $ | 101,140 | | 1.33 | %
Within 3 years | $ | 1,685,971 | | 22.22 | %
Within 4 years | $ | 3,131,799 | | 41.28 | %
Within 5 years | $ | 2,660,083 | | 35.06 | %
TOTAL | $ | 7,587,349 | | | 

 
All loans are written with a fixed 5-year term (closed end) with no exceptions, providing an affordable repayment either weekly or monthly. However, loans can be repaid early without any penalty. As the tables above show, the Company has a substantial long duration loan book with over 86% of current loans maturing in more than two years’ time and the majority mature in the 3 to 5 year range, which is expected to continue in the future.
 
Loan Underwriting
 
Applicants apply online providing income, employment and banking information in the pre-approval process. The pre-approval process utilizes a soft credit pull, electronic review of 60-90 day banking history and if the applicant successfully meets the minimum pre-approval criteria they are invited to proceed. Upon accepting the conditional pre-approval, the applicant authorizes a full credit report from Experian and verification of employment. Applicants are provided disclosures and privacy statements during this process.
 
Once the application has been transmitted, a full credit report is obtained and the automated preliminary underwriting is completed based on stated income and expense data obtained from the credit report. The automated preliminary underwriting includes, but is not limited to, credit score, number of credit inquiries, outstanding unpaid collections, length of credit history, length of employment, debt to income ratio and internet protocol, or “IP,” address to verify location of applicant.
 
The second step in the underwriting process for those applicants that are conditionally approved based on stated income, credit score, number of credit inquires, outstanding unpaid collections, length of credit history and length of employments, debt to income ratio, IP address, is to validate the actual income (current pay invoices and prior year W-2) and a review of the 60-90 day read-only statements from the applicant’s primary bank for satisfactory money management. During this process the pay invoices are reviewed for garnishments, hardship loans and other legal liens allowed on wages. Bank statements are transmitted electronically directly to underwriting to ensure the integrity of the information. This process allows the underwriter to review the money management of every applicant and to assess the ability to take on additional expense. It also provides the underwriter with additional debt not found on traditional credit reports such as payday loans, title loans and IRS payments that could affect the ability of the applicant to assume additional debt. If all conditions are met as it relates to money management, maximum debt to income, minimum length of employment, and satisfactory credit history the underwriter recommends final approval and request to draw documents.
 
The final step in the underwriting process is to present the completed file to the Chief Credit Officer for final approval and order to draw documents. The file is then reviewed for any exceptions to policy, compliance with the underwriting policies and to ensure the loan system is reflective of what has been presented by the underwriter. The applicant is then approved for a $5,000 or $10,000 loan based on income, ability to repay and credit strength. Rate and loan terms are fixed (fixed rate and fixed term can vary based on regulatory state maximums) as we do not utilize risk based variable pricing models eliminating the risk of discrimination and other compliance related issues.
 
The closing process is completed by contacting the applicant, communicating the lending decision and reviewing loan terms and conditions. Upon acceptance an identity check using Experian’s Precise Identity Screening is completed and if successful loan documents are emailed for electronic signature, and returned to us for final verifications, document review and funding.

Servicing
 
All of our loan servicing is handled in our centralized Las Vegas head office. All servicing and collection activity is conducted and documented using an industry standard loan service software system which handles and records all records and transactions of loan originations, loan servicing, collections and reporting.
 
Our primary third-party servicing arrangement is with CyberRidge, LLC, a company that licenses its consumer loan software to us. We use this software for our loan management system. We have a servicing agreement with CyberRidge, LLC which renews automatically unless either party notifies the other, at least 60 days prior to the end of the renewal term. We believe the risk of termination is low as we are a paying customer of CyberRidge, LLC and have maintained a positive working relationship since 2012. In the unlikely event that the agreement was terminated, we believe 60 days’ notice would be sufficient to find a suitable replacement with minimal disruption to our business.

Cryptocurrency/Blockchain
 
On December 22, 2017, we announced that we had formed a wholly owned subsidiary to explore the legalities and economic risks and benefits of entering into a joint venture with IEC to accept repayment of customer loans in the form of existing crypto/blockchain currencies, provide the crypto equivalent of $5,000 and $10,000 loans to customers, and also potentially create and issue an IEC cryptocurrency. The company did not begin operations and was in the development planning stages. On March 14, 2018, we announced that, after considering the potential risks and benefits, we will not pursue a cryptocurrency offering or any other cryptocurrency-related ventures at this time. We will continue to monitor the developing regulatory landscape surrounding this new technology and may consider cryptocurrency opportunities in the future. In addition, we will continue to explore the potential application of blockchain technology to our core consumer lending business.

Regulation
 
Consumer loans in the United States are regulated at both the federal and state level. National oversight is provided by the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces the following credit laws that protect consumers’ rights to get, use and maintain credit:

● | The Truth in Lending Act promotes the informed use of consumer credit, by requiring disclosures about its terms and cost to standardize the manner in which costs associated with borrowing are calculated and disclosed. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Fair Credit Reporting Act promotes the accuracy and privacy of information in the files of the nation’s credit reporting companies. If a company denies an application, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act consumers have the right to the name and address of the credit reporting company they contacted, provided the denial was based on information given by the credit reporting company. 
● | The Equal Opportunity Credit Act prohibits credit discrimination on the basis of sex, race, marital status, religion, national origin, age, or receipt of public assistance. Creditors may ask for this information (except religion) in certain situations, but they may not use it to discriminate against consumers when deciding whether to grant you credit. 
● | The Fair Credit Billing Act and Electronic Fund Transfer Act establish procedures for resolving mistakes on credit billing and electronic fund transfer account statements. 
● | The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the “FDCPA”) applies to personal, family, and household debts. The FDCPA prohibits debt collectors from engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices while collecting these debts. 

 
In addition, the CFPB, a federal oversight body organized in connection with the Dodd-Frank Act has broad authority over our business. The CFPB is a new agency which commenced operations in 2011, and there continues to be uncertainty as to how the agency’s actions or the actions of any other new agency could impact our business or that of our issuing banks. The CFPB has the authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and to enforce those laws against and examine financial institutions for compliance. The CFPB is authorized to prevent “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices” through its regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority. To assist in its enforcement, the CFPB maintains an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products, including the loan products we facilitate. This system could inform future CFPB decisions with respect to its regulatory, enforcement or examination focus.
 
We are subject to the CFPB’s jurisdiction, including its enforcement authority, as a servicer and acquirer of consumer credit. The CFPB may request reports concerning our organization, business conduct, markets and activities. The CFPB may also conduct on-site examinations of our business on a periodic basis if the CFPB were to determine, through its complaint system, that we were engaging in activities that pose risks to consumers.
 
There continues to be uncertainty as to how the CFPB’s strategies and priorities, including in both its examination and enforcement processes, will impact our businesses and our results of operations going forward. Actions by the CFPB could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected loan products and services, making them less attractive and restricting our ability to offer them.
 
Consumer loans are also regulated at the state level, and the regulatory requirements vary between states. We are licensed in the following states:

The statutes also subject us to the supervisory and examination authority of state regulators in certain cases.
 
We did not incur any costs in connection with the compliance with any federal, state, or local environmental laws.
 
Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive environment. Several personal consumer loan companies operate in the United States. Our competitors include:
 

● | large, publicly-traded, state-licensed personal loan companies, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | peer-to-peer lending companies, such as Lending Club and Prosper, 
● | online personal loan companies, such as Avant, 
● | “brick and mortar” personal loan companies, including those that have implemented websites to facilitate online lending, and 
● | payday lenders, tribal lenders and other online consumer loan companies.

We believe we compete based on affordable repayment terms, favorable interest rates and low overhead due to on-line distribution. We believe that in the future we will face increased competition from these companies as we expand our operations. Most of the entities against which we compete, or may compete, are larger and have greater financial resources than us. No assurance can be given that increased competition will not have an adverse effect on our company.
 
Office Location
 
Our executive office, which also serves as our centralized operational headquarters and Nevada branch, is located at 3960 Howard Hughes Parkway, Suite 490, Las Vegas, Nevada 89169. This facility occupies a total of approximately 1,906 square feet under a lease that expires on September 30, 2020. Our annual rental cost for this facility is approximately $69,531, plus a proportionate share of operating expenses which are expected to be minimal as the space is 1.32% of the total building rentable space. We believe this facility is adequate for our current and near term future needs due to our online strategy and our ability to operate 7 days a week with unrestricted hours of operation from this location.
Employees
 
As of March 28, 2018, we had five full-time employees. None of our employees is represented by a union. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Corporate History
 
We were organized as a Florida corporation on January 21, 1999, under the name Interact Technologies, Inc. (“Interact”). Interact was formed for the purpose of acquiring certain medical technology. On February 18, 1999, we changed our name to Fairhaven Technologies, Inc. (“Fairhaven”). Fairhaven’s business plan continued to involve the acquisition of certain medical technology. By June 1999, Fairhaven abandoned its business plan and had no operations until December 2001. On December 14, 2001, we changed our name to Ideal Accents, Inc. Ideal Accents, Inc. was engaged primarily in the business of accessorizing cars and trucks at the new vehicle dealer level. Ideal Accents, Inc. ceased operations in 2005. IEC, our wholly owned subsidiary, commenced operations in 2010 and in February 2013, we changed our name to IEG Holdings Corporation.
 
In 2005, Mr. Mathieson, our Chief Executive Officer and sole director, founded IEG in Sydney, Australia. IEG launched the Amazing Loans business in Australia in 2005 and the Mr. Amazing Loans business in the United States via IEGC in 2010. From 2005 until 2012, Mr. Mathieson operated the Amazing Loans business through IEG in Australia. In 2012 following an extensive cost/benefit analysis, IEG’s management made a strategic decision to focus on its U.S. operations and cease its Australian operations. Management concluded that it should cease Australian operations due to the following:
 

● | a lack of funding opportunities for non-U.S. loan receivables, 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the difficulties of operating in the Australian time zone compared to the Las Vegas time zone of its principal executive offices, 
● | the Australian requirement to maintain a specific Australian lending license for Australian operations or to utilize expensive outsourcing for licensing, 
● | the small size of the Australian consumer finance market as compared to the U.S. market (approximately 1/100th of the size), 
● | the lack of automation opportunities in Australia due to the absence of instant access to FICO credit score information and other significant data only available for U.S. residents, 
● | the significant extra cost and time requirements to provide audited accounts for any non-Australian operations, 
● | significantly different/expensive website and documentation requirements for Australia, and 
● | the perceived reticence of U.S. investors to invest in Australian operations (mainly due to an unwillingness to travel to Australia for due diligence purposes). 

 
Accordingly, IEG ceased doing business in Australia in 2012.
 
On January 28, 2013, IEGC entered into a stock exchange agreement (the “Stock Exchange Agreement”) among IEGC, its sole stockholder, IEG, and our company. Under the terms of the Stock Exchange Agreement, we agreed to acquire a 100% interest in IEGC for 272,447 shares of our common stock after giving effect to a 1-for-6 reverse stock split (also adjusted for the 1-for-100 reverse stock split that took effect June 17, 2015 and the net 1-for-10 reverse stock split that was effective on October 27, 2016). On February 14, 2013, we filed an amendment to our articles of incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary of State of Florida which had the effect of:

● | changing our name from Ideal Accents, Inc. to IEG Holdings Corporation, 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | increasing the number of shares of our authorized common stock to 1,000,000,000, $0.001 par value, 
● | creating 50,000,000 shares of “blank-check” preferred stock, and 
● | effecting the Reverse Stock Split pursuant to the terms of the Stock Exchange Agreement. 

 
FINRA approved the amendment to our articles of incorporation, as amended, on March 11, 2013.
 
On March 13, 2013, we completed the acquisition of IEGC under the terms of the Stock Exchange Agreement and issued to IEG 272,447 shares of our common stock after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split whereby we acquired a 100% interest in IEGC. The stock exchange agreement between IEGC, IEG and IEG Holdings resulted in a reverse acquisition with a public shell, with IEGC being the accounting acquirer. IEG Holdings issued 90 shares of its common stock to the stockholders of IEG (IEG transferred its ownership in IEGC to its stockholders, which is why the shares were issued to the ultimate stockholders of IEG rather than to IEG itself) for each share of IEGC, in exchange for 100% ownership interest in IEGC. We determined that IEGC was the accounting acquirer because of the following facts and circumstances:
 

1. | After consummation of the transaction, the ultimate stockholders of IEGC own 99.1% of the outstanding shares of IEG Holdings; 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | The board of directors of IEG Holdings immediately after the transaction is comprised exclusively of former directors of IEGC; and 
3. | The operations of IEG Holdings immediately after the transaction are those of IEGC. 

 
After completing the Stock Exchange Agreement and terminating all Australian operations via the sale of the remaining loan book, IEG entered into voluntary liquidation on June 25, 2014. In August 2015, IEGC assigned all of its tangible and intangible assets to IEG Holdings and IEGC was dissolved.
 
On May 1, 2015, we filed articles of amendment to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary of State of Florida. The amendment was approved by FINRA, and became effective, on June 17, 2015. The articles of amendment effected (i) a 1-for-100 reverse stock split, and (ii) an increase in our authorized capital stock from 2,550,000,000 shares to 3,050,000,000 shares, of which 3,000,000,000 shares are common stock and 50,000,000 are preferred stock.
 
On September 10, 2015, we filed articles of amendment to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary of State of Florida. The articles of amendment had the effect, among other things, of adjusting the conversion ratio of the Series H preferred stock, from 1,333/100,000 (0.01333) to 2,666/100,000 (0.02666) shares of common stock for each Series H preferred share, to account for the Company’s offering to existing stockholders of the Company commenced August 3, 2015.
 
On December 1, 2015, we filed articles of amendment to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary of State of Florida. The articles of amendment had the effect, among other things, of adjusting the conversion ratio of the Series H preferred stock, from 2,666/100,000 (0.02666) to 5,332/100,000 (0.05332) shares of common stock for each Series H preferred share, to account for the Company’s offering to existing stockholders of the Company commenced December 1, 2015.
 
On January 8, 2016, we filed articles of amendment to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary of State of Florida. The articles of amendment had the effect, among other things, of adjusting the conversion ratio of the Series H preferred stock, from 5,332/100,000 (0.05332) to 0.1 shares of common stock for each Series H preferred share, to account for the Company’s offering to existing stockholders of the Company commenced January 8, 2016.
 
On March 22, 2016, we filed articles of amendment to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended. The amendment had the effect, among other things, of adjusting the conversion ratio of the Series H preferred stock from 0.1 shares to 0.2 shares of common stock for each Series H preferred share, to account for our offering to existing stockholders commenced March 16, 2016.
 
Effective April 1, 2016, we amended our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, in order to effect a 1-for-100 reverse stock split. No fractional shares were issued. Rather, we paid stockholders who would have received a fractional share an amount equal to the average closing price per share of our common stock on the OTCQB, averaged over the period of 30 consecutive calendar days ending on (and including) April 1, 2016. In April 2016, we purchased 1,793 shares of the common stock of IEG Holdings in exchange for an aggregate purchase price of $130,769, equivalent to $72.93 per share. As a result, there was a reduction in the number of record holders with 676 record holders of the Company receiving cash in exchange for their shares of IEG Holdings in connection with this forward stock split and reverse stock split transaction. In addition, after the reverse stock split was effected on April 1, 2016, we amended our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, to effect (i) a 100-for-1 forward stock split, and (ii) a reduction in the number of authorized shares of common stock from 3 billion to 200 million.

Legal Proceedings
 
We are not a party to any pending or threatened litigation.
 
Emerging Growth Company Status
 
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of all of these exemptions.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first common equity offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier if our annual revenues exceed $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in any three-year period or if we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.
