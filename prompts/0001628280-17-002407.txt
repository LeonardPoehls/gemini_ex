BUSINESS
Overview
Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a pipeline of oncology products including candidates intended to treat specific genetic and epigenetic drivers of cancer in selected subsets of cancer patients with unmet needs. Additionally, we are evaluating our product candidates in combination with checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1 and PD-L1) to determine whether they will enhance the efficacy of those agents in patients with non-small cell lung cancer ("NSCLC") and other solid tumors. We believe that an increased understanding of the genomic factors that drive tumor cell growth can lead to the development of cancer drugs that target these genomic factors, resulting in increased efficacy while reducing side effects. 
Our clinical pipeline consists of three product candidates: glesatinib, sitravatinib and mocetinostat. Both glesatinib and sitravatinib are orally-bioavailable, spectrum-selective kinase inhibitors with distinct target profiles that are in development for the treatment of patients with NSCLC and other solid tumors. Glesatinib is in Phase 2 clinical development, and targets the MET and Axl receptor tyrosine kinase families ("RTKs"). Sitravatinib is in Phase 1b clinical development and targets genetic alterations in RET gene rearrangements, CHR4q12 amplifications, CBL mutations and AXL alterations. We are also evaluating sitravatinib in a multi-arm Phase 2 clinical trial to determine its ability to enhance the clinical efficacy of nivolumab, a checkpoint inhibitor approved for the treatment of patients with a variety of solid tumors including NSCLC and metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (“RCC”). Our third candidate is mocetinostat, an orally-bioavailable, Class 1 selective histone deacetylase ("HDAC") inhibitor. Mocetinostat is in Phase 1b/2 clinical development in combination with durvalumab, MedImmune Limited’s ("MedImmune") anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with NSCLC. 
Our novel kinase inhibitors, glesatinib and sitravatinib, are intended to treat specific mutations that drive the growth of cancer or are implicated in cancer drug resistance or pathogenic processes such as tumor angiogenesis. Sitravatinib is a potent inhibitor of the Tyro, Axl, Mer ("TAM") family of kinases which we believe may lead to enhanced anti-tumor immunity in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors by changing the tumor microenvironment from a tolerogenic to an immunogenic state and increasing anti-tumor immune response by reducing T-cell and macrophage suppressor effects. Our HDAC inhibitor, mocetinostat, acts through important epigenetic mechanisms, the effects of which could potentially enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors when used in combination. 
Two candidates are in pre-clinical development. The first is a highly-potent and potentially best-in-class LSD1 inhibitor with potential for rapid clinical proof-of-concept in small cell lung cancer ("SCLC") or acute myeloid leukemia ("AML"). An investigational new drug ("IND") submission is planned for this compound in late 2017. Additionally, a mutant-selective KRAS inhibitor program is advancing to candidate selection phase and prototype inhibitors have demonstrated marked tumor regression in KRAS mutant tumor models, with an IND candidate selection anticipated by the end of 2017. We plan to identify additional drug development opportunities by leveraging our deep scientific understanding of molecular drug targets and mechanisms of resistance and potentially in-licensing or internally discovering promising, early-stage novel drug candidates.

Our three clinical stage product candidates are further described below:

• | Glesatinib is an orally-bioavailable, potent, small molecule kinase inhibitor of MET and Axl RTKs. Glesatinib is in clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors, with an initial focus on NSCLC.

We presently have two ongoing clinical trials of glesatinib: a single-arm Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of NSCLC patients with genetic alterations of MET and a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with genetic alterations of MET and Axl in NSCLC and other solid tumors.
On January 5, 2017, we provided a clinical update focused on our experience with a spray dried dispersion (“SDD”) formulation of glesatinib that was implemented in the ongoing Phase 1b and Phase 2 clinical trials in May 2016. We announced that patients from both Phase 1b and Phase 2 trials were assessed as of December 2, 2016 to evaluate the impact of the SDD formulation (n=41) as compared to the prior soft gel formulation (n=50). Adverse event-related (“AE-related”) dose reductions occurred in 17% (7/41) of patients treated with the SDD formulation, versus 46% (23/50) of patients treated with the prior soft gel formulation. In patients who were transitioned to the SDD formulation during 
3

their therapy (n=12), AE-related dose reductions took place in 8% (1/12) of patients versus 33% (4/12) of patients treated with the soft gel formulation.
In an initial evaluation of 24 genetically-selected patients treated with the SDD formulation: 11 patients were in the Phase 2 MET Exon 14 deletion mutation cohort, of whom eight were evaluable; eight patients were in the Phase 2 MET amplification cohort, all of whom were evaluable; and five patients were in the Phase 1b trial with MET Exon 14 deletion mutations, who had clinical characteristics and genetic driver alterations identical to the entry criteria in the ongoing Phase 2 trial, all of whom were evaluable.

In MET Exon 14 deletion patients treated with the SDD formulation across both the Phase 1b and Phase 2 trials, glesatinib demonstrated promising activity. In the Phase 2 trial, one confirmed partial response (“PR”) and two unconfirmed PRs out of the eight evaluable patients were observed. As of December 2, 2016, one unconfirmed PR remained on study awaiting a confirmatory scan. Tumor reduction was observed in six of eight evaluable patients. In the Phase 1b trial, three confirmed PRs out of five evaluable patients were observed. Tumor reduction was observed in all five patients. Overall, data in these 13 patients reflected an objective response rate (“ORR”) of 46% across the Phase 1b and Phase 2 patient populations, including confirmed and unconfirmed responses. Tumor reduction was observed in 11 of 13 patients. As of December 2, 2016, the longest duration of a patient on study was more than 55 weeks and the patient remained on study.
In MET amplification patients treated with the SDD formulation, glesatinib also demonstrated clinical benefit. In the Phase 2 trial, two unconfirmed PRs out of eight evaluable patients were observed. Neither of the unconfirmed responses remains on study. Tumor reduction was observed in six of eight evaluable patients. As of December 2, 2016, the longest duration of a patient on study was more than 24 weeks and the patient remained on study.
The Company expects to provide an additional update on the glesatinib program in the second half of 2017. 

• | Sitravatinib is an orally-bioavailable, potent, small molecule spectrum-selective kinase inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors with an emphasis on genetic alterations involving RET gene rearrangements, CHR4q12 amplifications, CBL mutations and AXL alterations. Sitravatinib is being evaluated in a Phase 1b expansion clinical trial designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy in multiple pre-specified cohorts of cancer patients with these genetic mutations.

On January 5, 2017 we provided a clinical update of the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial. As of a data cut-off of December 9, 2016, a total of six NSCLC patients with RET gene rearrangements had been enrolled, four of whom were evaluable. Of the four evaluable patients, one patient with a KIF5B-RET gene rearrangement demonstrated a confirmed PR and one patient with a DSP RET gene rearrangement had achieved an unconfirmed PR on initial scan, representing a 50% ORR, including confirmed and unconfirmed responses. As of December 9, 2016, both patients remained on study. A third patient with RET gene rearrangements demonstrated tumor reduction of 29%, representing stable disease. Tumor reduction was observed in all four patients. As of December 9, 2016, the longest duration of a patient on study was more than 46 weeks and the patient remained on study. The Phase 1b trial is also enrolling NSCLC patients with CBL mutations, CHR4q12 amplification and AXL alterations. As of the data cut-off date, no patients with these genetic mutations were evaluable. The Company expects to provide an update on efficacy data in the third quarter of 2017.
Sitravatinib is also being evaluated in combination with nivolumab, a checkpoint inhibitor approved for the treatment of patients with a variety of solid tumors including NSCLC and metastatic RCC. Pre-clinical data indicate sitravatinib is an exceptionally potent inhibitor of the TAM and split (KDR, KIT, PDGFRA) family tyrosine kinases which regulate multiple stages in the cancer immunity cycle and are thought to enhance anti-tumor immunity by improving the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors (anti PD-1/PD-L1). Enrollment of this multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with NSCLC commenced in November 2016. The Company expects to provide initials results from this combination trial in the third quarter of 2017.

• | Mocetinostat is an orally administered spectrum-selective Class 1 HDAC inhibitor. Preclinical data suggests that mocetinostat has the potential to enhance anti-tumor efficacy when combined with immunotherapy by increasing HLA expression and tumor immunogenicity, depleting regulatory T-cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells and increasing tumor PD-L1 expression. A Phase 1b/2 clinical trial combining mocetinostat and durvalumab, MedImmune’s monoclonal antibody inhibiting PD-L1, continues to enroll patients with advanced solid tumors and NSCLC. The Company expects to provide an additional update on the mocetinostat program mid-year 2017.

Our Strategy
Our goal is to be a leading developer of cancer therapies. We are currently focused on therapies targeted for genetically selected patient populations as well as combinations of these targeted therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors. The key components of our strategy include:

• | Develop a pipeline of targeted cancer therapies. We believe that an increased understanding of the genomic factors that drive tumor cell growth will lead to the development of cancer drugs with increased efficacy while reducing side effects. We are leveraging the prior successful experience of certain members of our management team in the development and approval of multiple oncology and targeted oncology drugs (e.g. Temodar, Sutent, Inlyta, Xalkori, and Ibrance) to develop targeted cancer therapies to address unmet needs in specific cancer populations. Our clinical pipeline is comprised of two novel kinase inhibitors that target specific mutations that drive cancer cell growth and an HDAC inhibitor which is one of the most advanced epigenetic therapies in development. We plan to identify additional targets by leveraging our deep scientific understanding of molecular drug targets and mechanisms of resistance through internal drug discovery activities or potentially in-licensing promising, early-stage novel drug candidates. 


• | Employ efficient and flexible approaches to accelerate clinical development. Based on the prior extensive experience of certain members of our management team in oncology drug development, which includes the successful registration of several products, we take an adaptive approach to our clinical trials so that we use the information from the ongoing trials to increase our likelihood of success. We will pursue indications and select specific patient populations in which activity of our product candidates can be assessed in small proof of concept ("POC") clinical trials potentially leading to accelerated clinical development. When designing clinical trials, we structure our clinical development approach to test multiple clinical hypotheses in a single trial and design trials with the flexibility to adapt quickly and accelerate once a signal of clinical benefit is observed. We believe our approach may increase the likelihood of seeing results early in clinical trials with fewer patients, reducing our clinical development risk and development costs and allowing us to potentially accelerate the development of our product pipeline. 


• | Advance our two lead kinase inhibitors. We have two internally discovered novel kinase inhibitors in development: glesatinib and sitravatinib. These product candidates target pathways of high scientific interest, including MET, AXL, RET, CHR4q12 and CBL. These pathways are believed to be drivers of tumor growth and to be responsible for the development of tumor resistance to several anti-cancer treatments. Glesatinib is in Phase 2 development and sitravatinib is currently in a Phase 1b dose expansion clinical trial and a Phase 2 clinical trial in combination with nivolumab.


• | Advance mocetinostat, our HDAC inhibitor. HDAC inhibitors modulate epigenetic events by their potent inhibition of histone deacetylation. This class of agents has been shown to be effective, as single agents, in treating hematologic malignancies, as evidenced by the approvals of Istodax, Zolinza, Beleodaq and Farydak. A growing body of evidence indicates that Class I HDAC inhibitors like mocetinostat have effects directly on tumor cells as well as on immune cells (regulatory T cells ("T-regs") and Myeloid-derived Suppressor Cells ("MDSCs")) that may enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab, pemrolizumab, durvalumab and others. We have completed several clinical trials with mocetinostat in more than 400 patients which have provided valuable information on the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety profile of the drug. We are currently evaluating mocetinostat in combination with MedImmune’s immune checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab in NSCLC since we believe that is the most promising indication and will create the greatest benefit for the largest number of patients.


• | Advance our pre-clinical development programs. We maintain an active discovery research function focused on identifying molecules to target novel pathways in the treatment of cancer. We have developed two candidates internally including an LSD1 inhibitor, for which we expect to file an IND by late 2017 with an initial focus on AML and SCLC, and a mutant-selective KRAS inhibitor that is entering the preclinical candidate selection phase. 


• | Leverage partnerships to develop our product candidates and companion diagnostics. We plan to collaborate with third parties and partner certain rights to our product candidates as a means to accelerate their broader clinical development and maximize their therapeutic and market potential. We plan to retain certain key development and commercialization rights in our partnerships. We believe that retaining this strategic flexibility will enable us to maximize shareholder value. For example, we have entered into collaboration agreements, including with Foundation Medicine, Inc. and Guardant Health, Inc. to explore development of their platforms as companion diagnostics for glesatinib and to leverage their commercial testing platforms to enable enrollment in our clinical trials that are treating genetically selected patients.

Our Targeted Kinase Programs
Specific genes or pathways that are inappropriately activated in certain types of cancer cells and not in normal tissue are called driver mutations. Targeted therapies selectively inhibit these driver mutations. RTKs are a family of kinases involved in the transmission of signals that regulate intercellular processes, including those that control cell growth and cell division. RTKs may be inappropriately activated in cancerous tissues resulting in uncontrolled tumor cell growth. Aberrant kinase function, caused by genetic mutations, gene amplification, or over-expression, underlies many cancer cell processes, making the kinome an important source for therapeutic targets in oncology. Discoveries of specific drivers of disease have led to the development of targeted therapies, or the tailoring of therapies to a particular tumor or disease profile. In some cases, these therapies have proven to be more efficacious while having fewer side effects than traditional non-targeted therapies, such as chemotherapy, which kill healthy cells along with cancer cells. Examples of successful development of oral targeted kinase inhibitors include Novartis AG’s Gleevec, a BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia; and GlaxoSmithKline’s Tykerb, a HER2 kinase inhibitor for the treatment of a subset of breast cancer patients over-expressing the HER2 kinase. Further examples of oral targeted kinase inhibitors include Pfizer’s Xalkori and Bosulif and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Sprycel. We believe that therapies targeting specific genetic abnormalities in subsets of cancer patients identified through companion diagnostic tests will result in streamlined clinical trials and improved patient outcomes and will be increasingly important in the continued evolution of the treatment of cancer.
We believe that by selecting patients whose tumors have genetic mutations and alterations in the pathways that are critical for tumor growth and that may be potently inhibited by our drugs, we will increase the potential for clinical benefit. A greater clinical benefit in selected patients would increase the likelihood of demonstrating clinical benefit earlier in development, potentially in Phase 1, which may allow us to move rapidly into registration trials. As a part of our ongoing development activities, we are using commercial diagnostic assays as well as assays developed internally for early clinical trials. We are working with external diagnostic providers to develop validated companion diagnostics for later stage clinical use and for potential registration to ensure that the diagnostic is widely available for commercial use upon approval. In December of 2015 we announced collaborations with Foundation Medicine, Inc., and Guardant Health, Inc. to explore development of their platforms as companion diagnostics for glesatinib and to leverage their commercial testing platforms to enable enrollment in our clinical trials that are treating genetically selected patients.

Our kinase inhibitor programs in clinical development, glesatinib and sitravatinib, are kinase inhibitors with distinct target profiles. These new molecular entities are in development for the treatment of patients with NSCLC and other solid tumors that exhibit the genetic mutations and alterations of interest. Glesatinib and sitravatinib were developed internally and we own all global rights.
Glesatinib - A Multi Targeted Kinase Inhibitor for Solid Tumors
Glesatinib Overview
Glesatinib is an orally-bioavailable, potent, small molecule kinase inhibitor of MET and Axl. We are currently focused on our ongoing single-arm Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of NSCLC patients with genetic alterations of MET and a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with genetic alterations of MET and AXL in NSCLC and other solid tumors. Based on a meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), if we observe a response rate in the Phase 2 trial of glesatinib that is significantly better than the response rate for currently approved second line therapy, we believe the trial could potentially serve as a registration enabling trial and qualify for submission for accelerated approval under U.S. Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR Part 314, Subpart H (Accelerated Approval of New Drugs for Serious or Life-Threatening Illnesses).
Our development strategy for glesatinib is based on our understanding of the compound’s target inhibition profile and, accordingly, our focus for this program is NSCLC, although we intend to also explore other solid tumors where genetic alterations in MET or AXL are also known to be present. We intend to undertake patient selection using a targeted next generation sequencing assay to identify patients with certain genetic mutations or alterations of MET or AXL that result in oncogenic activation and are implicated as drivers of tumor progression.
Glesatinib Market Overview
The National Cancer Institute ("NCI") estimates that in 2016, approximately 224,000 patients in the United States ("U.S.") were diagnosed with lung cancer and 158,000 died due to the disease. Approximately 85% of lung cancers are NSCLCs. The potential oncogenic mutations of MET and AXL that we are targeting may exist in up to 6% of NSCLC cases. At present, the prevalence of the genetic alterations of MET and AXL is less well characterized in other solid tumors, however, they are known to occur in other solid tumors and we are exploring those additional indications. Although other tumor types may respond to treatment with glesatinib, NSCLC, HNSCC and gastroesophageal cancers are of particular relevance to demonstrate the clinical activity of glesatinib. 
Approximately 15% of NSCLC cases have activating EGFR mutations, equating to approximately 28,000 patients each year in the United States. Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target EGFR have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with EGFR mutations, tumors eventually become resistant to therapy. Resistance to EGFR therapy is mediated through mutation and/or overexpression of alternative targets and pathways, including MET and Axl in approximately 70% of resistant tumors, or approximately 20,000 patients annually in the United States.

Glesatinib Background
Glesatinib is a small molecule, spectrum-selective kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits MET and Axl. These targets have been shown to play key roles in tumor development, tumor cell survival, therapeutic resistance and blood vessel formation, or angiogenesis. Glesatinib is selective for these two targets at clinically achievable dose levels and shows minimal activity against a panel of over 300 other kinases. We believe this profile provides the following potential advantages for glesatinib:

• | therapeutic action against specific mutations and genetic alterations of MET;


• | therapeutic action against a novel target like Axl;


• | high specificity reduces the risk of side effects from off-target activity; and


• | the selection of specific patients whose tumors exhibit genetic alterations of MET or AXL that may be drivers of tumor growth provides an opportunity to demonstrate single agent clinical responses of glesatinib.

The MET receptor is a member of the RTK protein family that is found on the cell’s surface and which plays a key role in the growth, survival and metastasis of various types of cancers, when not properly regulated. The MET target has generated significant scientific and pharmaceutical interest because of its direct involvement in tumor cell survival and angiogenesis. MET expression is elevated in several major tumor types including NSCLC, gastric cancer, RCC and HCC and is associated with poor prognosis. MET activation may also be associated with resistance to EGFR inhibitors such as Tarceva, Iressa and Erbitux. In tumors with EGFR mutation or activation, the activation or genetic alteration of MET is implicated as an escape mechanism leading to EGFR-inhibitor resistance. Inhibition of MET may result in clinical benefit by blocking the MET-driven escape mechanism used by some tumor cells when treated with other targeted inhibitors of the EGFR, such as Tarceva or Iressa.
The profile of glesatinib and our clinical development strategy is clearly distinguished from MET antibody antagonists (such as MetMab) that inhibit the MET pathway signaling primarily by preventing the binding of HGF to MET. The inhibition of the catalytic activity of MET via small molecule strategies like glesatinib, as opposed to inhibition of ligand binding by MET antibody antagonists, is an important differentiated strategy in disease settings in which MET is activated by ligand-independent mechanisms including activating mutations, gene amplification, and/or extreme overexpression. Our primary focus in clinical development is on patients with NSCLC or other solid tumors exhibiting driver mutations in the MET and AXL pathways. These driver mutations result in constitutive activation of the MET or Axl receptors so they become independent of normally tightly regulated growth factor signaling. In the case of MET, genetic alterations can result in the activation of MET-dependent signaling independent of binding to HGF. Therefore, patients with these driver mutations would not be responsive to MET antibody antagonists that inhibit HGF binding, but are more likely to respond to glesatinib, which inhibits signaling irrespective of growth factor binding. Finally, in preclinical studies glesatinib has demonstrated inhibition of tumor cells which express mutant forms of MET that may be important mechanisms of resistance that appear to be greater than other known small molecule inhibitors of MET. Recent glesatinib data has indicated that glesatinib also potently inhibits certain mutant variants of MET (i.e., D1228N and Y1230C/H) that have recently been implicated in acquired resistance to other MET inhibitors including crizotinib and capmatinib. This data indicates that glesatinib may be able to be utilized as a differentiated MET inhibitor in patients exhibiting these mutations and may have utility in treating selected patients that become resistant to other classes of MET inhibitors. 
Glesatinib is distinguished from many other small molecule inhibitors of MET due in part to its potent activity against Axl, which provides an opportunity against tumors driven by Axl such as NSCLC tumors that exhibit a translocation of AXL that drives tumor growth, thereby increasing the likelihood that these tumors will respond to glesatinib. Further, MET and Axl are either overexpressed or genetically altered, or both, in tumors that are resistant to EGFR inhibitors such as Tarceva, Iressa and Erbitux. It is estimated that MET is overexpressed in approximately half of EGFR-resistant tumors, and amplified in 5-20% of EGFR-resistant tumors. It is estimated that Axl is overexpressed in approximately 20-30% of EGFR-resistant tumors. The simultaneous inhibition of both MET and Axl pathways may be required for clinical efficacy in patients developing resistance to EGFR inhibitors or for the prevention of resistance by combining glesatinib with an EGFR inhibitor as first line treatment. 
Axl is also an RTK, and its expression has been shown to correlate with clinical-stage and lymph node status in NSCLC. Axl can be dysregulated in certain cancers through increased protein expression or gene rearrangement, resulting in abnormal tumor growth and tumor cell survival. Axl has also been linked to resistance to EGFR inhibitors such as Tarceva and Erbitux. Axl is also expressed in other tumor types and may be a clinically significant driver in RCC, ovarian, pancreatic and other tumors.
Glesatinib Clinical Trials
8

Multiple Phase 1 clinical trials conducted with glesatinib show evidence of clinical activity as monotherapy and in combination trials. Glesatinib doses have resulted in exposures consistent with greater than 90% inhibition of MET mutations, MET amplifications and Axl gene rearrangements. Dosing is ongoing in the Phase 1b expansion study which is enrolling patients selected for specific genetic mutations and alterations of MET and AXL.
The original IND for glesatinib was filed in December 2007 and became effective in January 2008. To date, approximately 350 patients have been administered glesatinib in multiple clinical trials in a variety of solid tumor types. Glesatinib has been generally well tolerated at all doses and schedules tested to date, both as monotherapy and in combination with either Taxotere or Tarceva.
The most frequent treatment-related adverse events observed in prior clinical studies with glesatinib were diarrhea, fatigue and nausea. Other than as noted below, all of these trials were conducted with prior formulations of glesatinib that are no longer actively being developed. In addition, none of those prior trials were conducted in patient populations that were selected for genetic alterations or mutations in MET and AXL that we expect are the most likely to respond to treatment with glesatinib, which is our current development focus.
The historical glesatinib clinical trials are set forth in the following table.
CLINICAL TRIALS EVALUATING GLESATINIB 

Phase 1 Clinical Trial | Single Agent Dose Escalation, 21 day cycle | Completed (trial amended and continuing as described under Phase 1b dose expansion clinical trial below)
Phase 1b Clinical Trial | Single Agent Expansion Cohort in patients with genetic alterations of MET and Axl in NSCLC and other solid tumors, 21 day cycle | Ongoing 
Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial | Combination with Erlotinib or Docetaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC, 21 day cycle | Completed 
Phase 2 Clinical Trial | Single Agent Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with genetic alterations of MET in NSCLC, 21 day cycle | Ongoing 

The maximum tolerated dose (“MTD”) of glesatinib spray dried dispersion formulation was established as 750mg administered orally twice-daily on a 21 day continuous cycle. The observed dose limiting toxicities included one patient who experienced grade 3 fatigue and one patient that experienced grade 3 diarrhea. Clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data and nonclinical projections for glesatinib at the MTD indicate glesatinib plasma levels consistent with MET and Axl inhibition. 
Glesatinib Developmental Initiatives and Objectives
In December 2015, we initiated a single agent Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with genetic alterations of MET in NSCLC. Enrollment in the Phase 2 clinical trial is ongoing. Refer to the Overview section for the most recent update on the status of this clinical trial. We are also exploring other solid tumors that also have the genetic mutations and alterations of interest. 
We believe that by selecting patients whose tumors have genetic mutations and alterations that are implicated as oncogenic drivers and that are potently inhibited by glesatinib we may increase the likelihood of seeing clinical activity earlier in clinical development. We are using commercially available diagnostic assays as well as assays developed internally for early clinical use. We are developing companion diagnostics in collaboration with diagnostic platform providers including Foundation Medicine, Inc. and Guardant Health, that we plan to use in the current Phase 2 clinical trial, later stage trials and for commercialization, if approved.
Sitravatinib - A Novel Multi Targeted Kinase Inhibitor for Solid Tumors
Sitravatinib is an orally-bioavailable, potent, small molecule multi-targeted kinase inhibitor. Sitravatinib is a potent inhibitor of closely related RTKs including RET, CHR4q12, CBL and AXL. Sitravatinib has demonstrated oral bioavailability in preclinical studies, inhibited target-dependent tumor cell growth and survival, and demonstrated broad spectrum antitumor activity in preclinical cancer models including tumor regression in tumor models exhibiting genetic alteration of sitravatinib RTK targets.
We are focusing our development efforts on solid tumors in which genetic mutations and alterations of RET, CHR4q12, CBL and AXL are implicated as oncogenic drivers with an initial focus on NSCLC. We are also exploring novel patient selection strategies and are targeting patients with CHR4q12 amplicons, CBL inactivating mutations and AXL alterations that may be treatable 
9

with sitravatinib. Genetic alterations consisting of RET gene rearrangements, CHR4q12 amplifications, CBL mutations and AXL alterations account for up to 5.5% of NSCLC patient cases annually in the U.S. We also plan to evaluate other tumor types for which the RTK targets of sitravatinib may suggest activity. The MTD of sitravatinib is 150mg administered once a day, orally on a continuous schedule. Sitravatinib is being evaluated in a Phase 1b expansion clinical trial designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy in multiple pre-specified cohorts of cancer patients with genetic mutations involving sitravatinib targets, including a cohort of NSCLC patients with RET gene rearrangements. Refer to the Overview section for the most recent update on the status of this clinical trial.
Sitravatinib is a potent inhibitor of the TAM family of kinases which we believe may lead to enhanced anti-tumor immunity by changing the tumor microenvironment from a tolerogenic to an immunogenic state and increasing anti-tumor immune response by reducing T-cell and macrophage suppressor effects. Sitravatinib is also being evaluated in combination with nivolumab, a checkpoint inhibitor approved for the treatment of patients with NSCLC in a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with NSCLC. 
Mocetinostat - A Spectrum-Selective Oral HDAC Inhibitor 
Mocetinostat Overview
Mocetinostat is an orally administered, spectrum-selective Class 1 HDAC inhibitor. By virtue of its specificity for Class 1 HDACs, mocetinostat showed a favorable effect on the immune system in preclinical studies. By increasing PD-L1, costimulatory molecules, and HLA antigens on tumor cells, we believe that mocetinostat may enhance the immune response to tumors. Mocetinostat may also have a favorable effect on the immune system by decreasing T-regs and MDSCs. We believe that, overall, these effects on the immune system have the potential to enhance the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors. We are evaluating mocetinostat in combination with durvalumab, MedImmune’s monoclonal antibody inhibiting PD-L1 in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial which continues to enroll patients with advanced solid tumors and NSCLC. 
 The epigenetic mechanisms of HDAC inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in hematologic malignancies and have been approved as single agents. In addition, HDAC inhibition by agents like mocetinostat may be complementary with other epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetics is the regulation of gene expression and resulting cellular phenotypes through mechanisms other than primary DNA sequence alterations. The epigenetic regulation of gene expression involves the regulation of DNA methylation and modification of certain histones via modulation of acetylation or methylation of specific amino acid residues. Epigenetic pathways can become dysregulated during cancer progression through a variety of mechanisms, including the genetic alteration of molecules that participate in DNA methylation and histone modification.
Mocetinostat Market Overview
The potential of HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of certain cancers has been validated by the approval of Zolinza, Istodax and Beleodaq for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma and Farydak for multiple myeloma.
Our current focus for mocetinostat is on the treatment of patients with NSCLC in combination with durvalumab, MedImmune’s immune checkpoint inhibitor. We believe that the combination has the potential to address all patients with NSCLC. In the United States alone, the estimated annual incidence of NSCLC is approximately 190,000. 
Mocetinostat Background
Histones are protein components of the structural architecture of DNA known as chromatin (chromatin is the material that chromosomes are made of, and is comprised of DNA and histone proteins). Local gene expression activity can be controlled through epigenetic mechanisms by inducing changes in chromatin conformation through chemical modifications of histones. Acetylated histones are associated with a more open configuration of chromatin that is receptive to gene expression signals. In contrast, decreases in histone acetylation result in a more compact structure where gene expression is restricted or suppressed. Tumor suppressor genes serve to regulate cell growth and cell death, but during oncogenesis these tumor suppressor genes may become silenced due to HDAC-dependent decreases in histone acetylation leading to unrestricted growth of tumor cells. HDACs are a family of 11 enzymes (the individual HDAC enzymes are referred to as isoforms) that appear to act as a master regulator of the expression of genes. HDAC inhibitors modulate inappropriate deacetylation of histones to restore normal acetylation patterns as well as tumor suppressor gene expression. Inhibition of HDACs may result in multiple anti-cancer effects such as (1) the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, (2) the induction of apoptosis (cell death) of cancer cells, (3) improved cell cycle regulation,(4) the induction of tumor suppressor genes, and (5) re-establishing normal histone acetylation activity in cells where mutations or alterations may cause a loss of normal function.

We believe that a key differentiating feature of mocetinostat is its spectrum of activity, targeting HDAC isoforms 1, 2, 3 and 11 which are categorized as Class I (1,2,3) and Class IV (11) HDACs. We believe that these isoforms, and particularly isoforms 1 and 2, are the most relevant HDAC isoforms in cancer therapy and are also the isoforms most potently inhibited by mocetinostat. Compared to other HDAC inhibitors that have a broader spectrum of activity, the profile of mocetinostat may allow us to inhibit the targets relevant to cancer more potently and thereby potentially demonstrate improved clinical efficacy and reduced side effects. Furthermore, the selectivity of mocetinostat for Class I HDACs and the lack of activity against Class II HDACs may have complimentary effects on tumor cells and the immune system that would enhance the activity of checkpoint inhibitors and potentially expand the utility of checkpoint inhibition to the majority of patients with solid tumors who fail to respond to single agent checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
Mocetinostat Clinical Development
The first IND for mocetinostat was submitted in December 2003 and became effective in January 2004. Our current focus for mocetinostat is on the treatment of patients with NSCLC in combination with durvalumab and we initiated a clinical trial evaluating this combination approach in patients with NSCLC in the second quarter of 2016.
To date, we have evaluated mocetinostat as a monotherapy and in combination with other anticancer agents in more than 400 patients in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials with various malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndromes ("MDS"), hodgkin's lymphoma ("HL"), non-hodgkin's lymphoma ("NHL") including DLBCL or FL, acute myeloid leukemia ("AML"), chronic lymphocytic leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia, as well as advanced solid tumors. Through these trials, the safety and tolerability of mocetinostat as a single agent and in combination has been well characterized. The clinical trials showed activity as a single agent in HL and NHL and in combination with azacitidine in MDS and AML. 
We have completed several clinical trials with mocetinostat which enrolled more than 400 patients with a variety of advanced malignancies and we completed Phase 2 clinical trials in bladder cancer and NHL. To date we have not seen a level of activity or response to single agent mocetinostat that justifies continuing development in those indications. As a result, at the present time we do not expect to undertake further clinical trials with mocetinostat as a single agent in bladder cancer, NHL or MDS.
Intellectual Property
Patents and Proprietary Technology
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection wherever appropriate for our product candidates, formulations, processes, methods and any other proprietary technologies and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our practice is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, intellectual property protection for our current product candidates and any future product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of patents, protection of proprietary know-how and trade secrets, and contractual arrangements, both in the United States and abroad. However, patent protection may not afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. We also depend upon the skills, knowledge, experience and know-how of our management and research and development personnel as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how that is not patentable, we seek to put in place appropriate internal policies for the management of confidential information, and require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and which require disclosure and assignment or licensure to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
11

We typically file for patents in the United States with counterparts in certain countries in Europe and certain key market countries in the rest of the world, thereby covering the major pharmaceutical markets. As of December 31, 2016, we own or co-own U.S. patents and patent applications and their foreign counterparts, including 32 issued U.S. patents as reflected in the following table:
Granted and Pending U.S. Patents

Exclusivity arising from our issued patents for glesatinib extends to at least 2026, including our patents covering the specific composition of matter of glesatinib, and the generic class of compounds to which glesatinib belongs expires 2025, prior to legal or regulatory extensions, including any patent term extension, that may be available under the Hatch Waxman Act. Another four issued patents cover several distinct classes of kinase inhibitor compounds. Such coverage includes specific claims to sitravatinib, generic coverage of the class of compounds to which sitravatinib belongs, as well as patents covering methods of use of such compounds. Exclusivity arising from our patent protection for sitravatinib extends to at least 2029, prior to legal or regulatory extensions, including any patent term extension that may be available under the Hatch Waxman Act.
HDAC Program - (17 granted U.S. patents; 1 pending U.S. patent application)
Our patent estate for our HDAC program covers multiple series of HDAC inhibitors, including mocetinostat. As of December 31, 2016, this group of patents includes 15 issued patents and 1 pending patent applications in the United States protecting composition of matter and method of use. Two of the 15 issued patents cover mocetinostat generically and specifically. Exclusivity for mocetinostat extends to 2022 prior to legal or regulatory extensions, including any patent term extension that may be available under the Hatch Waxman Act.
In aggregate, these U.S. patents and patent applications cover the following inventions: novel HDAC inhibitors, including mocetinostat (eleven issued patents and one patent application), methods of inhibiting HDACs, methods for treating cell proliferative disease or cancer, specific methods for treating colon, lung and pancreatic cancers, and methods for treating polyglutamine expansion diseases such as Huntington’s disease. Two issued patents claim pharmaceutical compositions comprising a specific HDAC inhibitor and methods of use inhibiting HDACs for treating neurodegenerative disorders.
Licensing Agreements
We may enter into license or sub-license agreements when we believe such license is required to pursue a specific program.
Competition
Competitors in Oncology - Small Molecule Kinase Inhibitors
A large number of kinase inhibitors are currently in clinical trials, with many more in the early research stage. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are also developing monoclonal antibodies to kinase targets and their ligands.
Our glesatinib program is characterized by potential advantages including: a unique kinase spectrum including the emerging RTK target Axl; potent inhibition of MET driver mutations which are not inhibited by other small molecule inhibitors due to a different mode of binding to the MET molecule; a lack of activity against over 300 off-target kinases, supporting a favorable 
12

safety profile; and excellent tolerability to date in combination with other anti-cancer agents (including chemotherapy), thus optimizing the potential for combination therapy approaches.
Companies with MET inhibitors believed to be in late preclinical or clinical development include, but are not limited to: AbbVie, Inc., AstraZeneca PLC, Celldex Therapeutics Inc., Eli Lilly, Inc., Exelixis Inc., GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Ignyta, Inc., Incyte Corporation, Merck KGaA, NantPharma LLC, Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc.,Sanofi S. A., Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc., and Symphogen A/S.
Companies with Axl inhibitors in late preclinical or clinical development include, but are not limited to, Aravive Biologics, Inc., Astellas Pharma Inc., BergenBio AS, BioAtla LLC, Exelixis, Inc., Ignyta, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Les Laboratoires Servier, and Tolero, Inc.
Companies with RET inhibitors believed to be in late preclinical or clinical development include, but are not limited to, Blueprint Medicines, Inc., Ignyta, Inc., and Loxo Oncology, Inc. 
Competitors in Oncology - HDAC
We believe that a key differentiating feature of mocetinostat is its spectrum of activity covering only isoforms 1, 2, 3 and 11, which are the most relevant HDAC isoforms in human cancers. Other companies that are developing spectrum-selective HDAC inhibitors include, but are not limited to, Acetylon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Chroma Therapeutics Ltd., Huya Bioscience International, Shenzen Chipscreen Biosciences Ltd. and Syndax Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Companies with Pan-HDAC inhibitors, which are HDAC inhibitors that have an effect across a broader range of HDAC isoforms and are therefore not as selective as molecules like mocetinostat, include but are not limited to: Celgene Corporation, Curis Inc., MEI Pharma Inc., Merck & Co Inc., Novartis, Pharmacyclics Inc. and others. We expect that these and other companies may continue to pursue research and development in relation to HDAC inhibitors. We continue to monitor these and other companies in order to be aware of any third party products and/or intellectual property rights relevant to our products.
Competitors in Oncology - General 
In addition to companies that have HDAC inhibitors or kinase inhibitors addressing our targets of interest, our competition also includes hundreds of private and publicly traded companies that operate in the area of oncology but have therapeutics with different mechanisms of action. The oncology market in general is highly competitive, with over 1,000 molecules currently in clinical development. Other important competitors, in addition to those mentioned above, are small and large biotechnology companies, including, but not limited to, Amgen, Inc. and Gilead Sciences Inc., and specialty and regional pharmaceutical companies and multinational pharmaceutical companies, including but not limited to Astellas Pharma Inc., Bayer-Schering Pharmaceutical, Boehringer Ingelheim AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eisai Co. Ltd., Eli Lilly and Company, F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd., GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck KGaA, Novartis AG, Taiho and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.
Many companies have filed, and continue to file, patent applications which may or could affect our program if and when they issue, either because they protect a product that may compete with our product candidates, or because they protect intellectual property rights that are necessary for us to develop and commercialize our product candidates. These companies include, but are not limited to: Bristol-Myers Squibb, Compugen Limited, Exelixis, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Pfizer. Since this area is competitive and of strong interest to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, we expect that these and other companies will continue to publish and file patent applications in this space in the future, as well as pursuing research and development programs in this area. We continue to monitor these and other companies in order to be aware of any third party products and/or intellectual property rights relevant to our product candidates.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our product candidates, nor do we plan to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials and finished products for our preclinical and clinical trials.
Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Pharmaceutical product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved pharmaceutical products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by 
13

the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved new drug applications ("NDA"), including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented.
Government Regulation
The Regulatory Process for Drug Development
The production and manufacture of our product candidates and our research and development activities are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities around the world. In the United States, drug products are subject to regulation by the FDA. There are other comparable agencies in Europe and other parts of the world. Regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products. Applicable legislation requires licensing of manufacturing and contract research facilities, carefully controlled research and testing of products, governmental review and/or approval of results prior to marketing therapeutic products. Additionally, adherence to good laboratory practices (“GLP”) and good clinical practices (“GCP”) during nonclinical and clinical testing and cGMP during production is required. 
U.S. Pharmaceutical Product Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and implementing regulations. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States generally includes the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with GCP standards and regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.

The FDA monitors the progress of trials conducted in the U.S. under an IND and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s risk/benefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. The FDA may also place a hold on one or more clinical trials conducted under an IND for a drug if deems warranted. Furthermore, even after regulatory approval of an NDA is obtained, under certain circumstances, such as later discovery of previously unknown problems, the FDA can withdraw approval or subject the drug to additional restrictions.
Preclinical Studies:   Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to evaluate efficacy and activity, toxic effects, pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the pharmaceutical 
14

product candidate and to provide evidence of the safety, bioavailability and activity of the pharmaceutical product candidate in animals. Most of these studies must be performed according to GLP.
Clinical Trials:    Clinical trials involve the administration of the pharmaceutical product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by the sponsor. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA's GCP requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), or ethics committee at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB or ethics committee is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB or ethics committee also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
Clinical trials in the U.S. typically are conducted in sequential phases: Phases 1, 2, 3 and post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. The phases may overlap. The FDA may require that we suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds.
Phase 1 Clinical Trials:    Phase 1 clinical trials are generally conducted on a small number of healthy human subjects to evaluate the drug's activity, schedule and dose, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and other drug effects. However, in the case of life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, the initial Phase 1 testing may be done in patients with the disease. These trials typically take longer to complete and may provide insights into drug activity. Follow-on Phase 1b clinical trials may also evaluate efficacy with respect to trial participants.
Phase 2 Clinical Trials:    Phase 2 clinical trials are carried out on a relatively small number of patients (generally up to several hundred) in a specific indication. The pharmaceutical product is evaluated to preliminarily assess efficacy, to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and to determine optimal dose, regimens, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and dose response relationships. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning Phase 3 clinical trials.
Phase 3 Clinical Trials:    Phase 3 clinical trials involve tests on a much larger population of patients (several hundred to several thousand patients) suffering from the targeted condition or disease. These trials are undertaken to confirm proof of concept and further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety and are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA or foreign authorities for approval of marketing applications.
Post-Approval Clinical Trials:    Phase 4 clinical trials or other post-approval commitments may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval. Additional studies and follow-up may be conducted to document a clinical benefit where drugs are approved under accelerated approval regulations and based on surrogate endpoints. In clinical trials, surrogate endpoints are alternative measurements of the symptoms of a disease or condition that are substituted for measurements of observable clinical symptoms. Failure to timely conduct of Phase 4 clinical trials and follow-up could result in withdrawal of approval for products approved under accelerated approval regulations.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trial must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or for any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or, if used, its data safety and monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB or ethics committee can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's or ethics committee's requirements or if the pharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the pharmaceutical product, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the pharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the pharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
15

U.S. Pharmaceutical Review and Approval Process
Upon completion of pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies, the sponsor assembles all the product development, preclinical and clinical data along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the pharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, and submits it to the FDA as part of an NDA. If accepted by the FDA as substantially complete to permit substantive review, the submission or application is then reviewed for approval to market the product. This process takes eight months to one year to complete, but in some cases may take longer. At the end of the review period the FDA may issue a Complete Response Letter, refusing to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or requiring additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.
Accelerated Approval
Accelerated Approval is a program that is intended to make promising products for life threatening diseases available on the basis of evidence of effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Approvals of this kind typically include requirements for appropriate post-approval Phase 4 clinical trials to validate the surrogate endpoint or otherwise confirm the effect of the clinical endpoint. 
Post-Approval Requirements
Any pharmaceutical products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product's approved labeling (known as "off-label use"), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors and civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
As part of our clinical development plans, we are exploring the use of companion diagnostics to identify patients most likely to respond to our product candidates. Companion diagnostics are classified as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in the United States. In the United States, the FDA regulates the medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, reporting, recordkeeping, advertising and promotion, export and import, sales and distribution, and post-market surveillance of medical devices. Unless an exemption applies, companion diagnostics require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval ("PMA"). 
The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the cancer treatment to obtain a PMA simultaneously with approval of the drug. Based on the draft guidance, and the FDA's past treatment of companion diagnostics, we believe that the FDA will require a PMA for one or more companion diagnostics to identify patient populations suitable for our product candidates. The review of these companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our product candidates involves coordination of review by the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
16

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. In the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such products and services. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to their safety and efficacy and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. In particular, in the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices that are lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. As a result, coverage and adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our product candidates to enable us realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development.
The market for our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third-party payors' drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or may otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. In addition, because each third-party payor individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming and costly process. We would be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payor separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. This process could delay the market acceptance of any of our product candidates for which we may receive approval and could have a negative effect on our future revenue and operating results. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost-effective. If we are unable to obtain coverage and adequate payment levels for our product candidates from third-party payors, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them. This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.
Foreign Regulation 
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Several other types of state and federal laws restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws, which generally will not be applicable to us or our product candidates unless and until we obtain FDA marketing approval for any of our product candidates, include state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, physician payment, sunshine, patient protection and affordable care, privacy and security laws and regulations regarding providing drug samples. 
We may in the future be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1997 (“FCPA”). The FCPA and other similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties, or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. A determination that our operations or activities are not, 
17

or were not, in compliance with United States or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits and other legal or equitable sanctions. 
Other Laws 
In addition to the above, we are subject to a variety of financial disclosure and securities trading regulations as a public company in the U.S., including laws relating to the oversight activities of the SEC and the regulations of The NASDAQ Stock Exchange, on which our shares are traded. We are also subject to various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 52 employees located in our offices in San Diego. We also utilize the services of consultants on a regular basis. 32 employees are engaged in research and development activities and 20 are in general and administrative functions.
