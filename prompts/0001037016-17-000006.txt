Item 1. | Business

Corporate History
Overview. We were originally organized in 1995 as a holding company for the operations of Nextel Communications, Inc. in selected international markets. The corporation that is currently known as NII Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 2000 as Nextel International, Inc. In December 2001, we changed our name from Nextel International, Inc. to NII Holdings, Inc. Our principal executive office is located at 1875 Explorer Street, Suite 800, Reston, Virginia 20190. Our telephone number at that location is (703) 390-5100. Unless the context requires otherwise, “NII Holdings, Inc.,” “NII Holdings,” “we,” “our,” “us” and “the Company” refer to the combined businesses of NII Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. We refer to our wholly-owned Brazilian operating company, Nextel Telecomunicações Ltda., as Nextel Brazil. Nextel Brazil's operations are headquartered in São Paulo, with branch offices in Rio de Janeiro and various other cities in Brazil. 
Except as otherwise indicated, all amounts are expressed in United States, or U.S., dollars and references to “dollars” and “$” are to U.S. dollars. All historical financial statements contained in this report are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
Emergence from Chapter 11 Proceedings. On September 15, 2014, we and eight of our U.S. and Luxembourg-domiciled subsidiaries, including NII Capital Corp. and NII International Telecom, S.C.A., or NIIT, filed voluntary petitions seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, which we refer to as Chapter 11, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, which we refer to as the Bankruptcy Court. In addition, subsequent to September 15, 2014, five additional subsidiaries of NII Holdings filed voluntary petitions seeking relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. We refer to the companies that filed voluntary petitions seeking relief under Chapter 11 collectively as the Debtors. Nextel Brazil and our previous other operating subsidiaries in Latin America were not Debtors in these Chapter 11 cases. 
As described in more detail in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, on June 19, 2015, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving and confirming the Plan of Reorganization. On June 26, 2015, the conditions of the Bankruptcy Court's order and the Plan of Reorganization were satisfied, the Plan of Reorganization became effective, and we and the other Debtors emerged from the Chapter 11 proceedings. 
In accordance with the requirements of reorganization accounting, NII Holdings adopted the provisions of fresh start accounting as of June 30, 2015 and became a new entity for financial reporting purposes. References to the "Successor Company" relate to NII Holdings on or subsequent to June 30, 2015. References to the "Predecessor Company" relate to NII Holdings prior to June 30, 2015. For purposes of comparison to the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2014, we combined the results of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2015 with the results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2015. However, as a result of the application of fresh start accounting and other events related to our reorganization under Chapter 11, the Successor Company's financial results for the six months ended December 31, 2015 are prepared under a new basis of accounting and are not directly comparable to the Predecessor Company's financial results for the six months ended June 30, 2015. For the same reasons, our results of operations for the combined twelve-month period ended December 31, 2015 are not fully comparable to our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2014.
Divestitures. On January 27, 2016, two of our indirect subsidiaries completed the sale of our Argentine operations to Grupo Clarin. The transaction was structured as a sale of all of the outstanding equity interests of Nextel Communications Argentina, S.R.L., or Nextel Argentina, for an aggregate purchase price of $178.0 million. 
On April 30, 2015, we, together with one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, completed the sale of our Mexican operations to New Cingular Wireless, an indirect subsidiary of AT&T. The transaction was structured as a sale of all the outstanding stock of the parent company of Comunicaciones Nextel de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., or Nextel Mexico, for a purchase price of $1.875 billion, including $187.5 million deposited in escrow to satisfy potential indemnification claims. The net proceeds of the sale were $1.448 billion after deducting Nextel Mexico's outstanding indebtedness and applying other specified price adjustments. 
In August 2014, three of our wholly-owned subsidiaries completed the sale of all of the outstanding equity interests in our wholly-owned subsidiary Nextel Chile, S.A., or Nextel Chile, to Fucata, S.A., a venture comprised of Grupo Veintitres and Optimum Advisors for a de minimus amount.
In August 2013, two of our wholly-owned subsidiaries completed the sale of all of the outstanding equity interests in our wholly-owned subsidiary Nextel del Peru, S.A., or Nextel Peru, to Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones S.A. and one of its subsidiaries, Entel Inversiones, S.A., which we refer to collectively as Entel.

As a result of the sales of Nextel Argentina, Nextel Mexico, Nextel Chile and Nextel Peru, we are allocating almost all of our financial and other resources to our operations in Brazil. 
Nextel Brazil Business Overview
We provide wireless communication services under the NextelTM brand in Brazil with our principal operations located in major urban and suburban centers with high population densities and related transportation corridors of that country where we believe there is a concentration of Brazil’s business users and economic activity, including primarily Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.
In the second half of 2013, Nextel Brazil commercially launched services on its wideband code division multiple access, or WCDMA, network in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and surrounding areas and extended those services to other areas in Brazil by expanding the coverage of its network and utilizing roaming services and network sharing arrangements pursuant to agreements that it reached with another network operator in Brazil. Our WCDMA network enables us to offer a wide range of products and services supported by that technology, including data services provided at substantially higher speeds than can be delivered on our legacy integrated digital enhanced network, or iDEN.
Prior to the deployment of our WCDMA network, our services were primarily targeted to meet the needs of business subscribers. With the deployment of our WCDMA network in Brazil, our target market has shifted to individual consumers who use our services to meet both professional and personal needs. Our target subscribers generally exhibit above average usage, revenue and loyalty characteristics. We believe our target market is attracted to the services and pricing plans we offer, as well as the quality of and data speeds provided by our WCDMA network. 
We also offer long-term evolution, or LTE, services in Rio de Janeiro, and starting in December 2016, in São Paulo, and we continue to provide services on our legacy iDEN network throughout various regions in Brazil. Our transition to standards-based technologies such as WCDMA also gives us more flexibility to offer subscribers the option of purchasing services by acquiring the subscriber identity module, or SIM, cards from us separately, and by providing the customer with the option to use the SIM cards in one or more devices that they acquire from us or from other sources. 
The services we currently offer include:

• | mobile telephone voice service;


• | wireless data services, including mobile internet services, text messaging services and email services;


• | push-to-talk services, including Direct Connect®, Prip and International Direct Connect® services, which allow subscribers to talk to each other instantly; 


• | other value-added services, including location-based services, which include the use of Global Positioning System, or GPS, technologies; digital media services; and a wide ranging set of applications available via our content management system, as well as the AndroidTM open application market;


• | business solutions, such as security, work force management, logistics support and other applications that help our business subscribers improve their productivity; and


• | voice and data roaming services outside of our coverage areas.

As of December 31, 2016, Nextel Brazil had about 3.638 million total subscriber units in commercial service, which we estimate to be about 5% of total postpaid mobile handsets and other devices in commercial service in Brazil. We refer to these subscriber units in commercial service collectively as our subscriber base.
Operating Strategy 
Our goal is to grow our WCDMA-based subscriber base and revenues and manage the decline of our iDEN-based subscriber base and revenues by providing differentiated wireless communications services that are valued by our existing and potential subscribers. We are also striving to manage our capital and operating expenditures in the near term and improve our profitability and cash flow over the long term. Our strategy for achieving these goals is based on several core principles, including:

• | aligning our costs with our current business through continuous evaluation and streamlining of all capital and operating expenditures;


• | focusing on higher value customer segments that generate higher average revenue per user, or ARPU, and lower subscriber turnover;


• | utilizing the most profitable sales channels;

4



• | offering a unique and superior customer experience, including a reliable and high quality wireless network and online self-care and rate plan flexibility; and


• | building on the strength of the unique positioning of the Nextel brand.

To support our business plan, we have made significant capital and other investments as we deployed our WCDMA network and LTE upgrade. These investments have increased our costs and negatively impacted our profitability and are expected to continue to have that impact as we incur the fixed costs associated with our network while building the subscriber base it serves. However, we believe that our investments have enhanced, and will continue to enhance, the competitiveness of our service offerings while continuing to support the differentiated services and superior customer service that have historically been significant factors supporting our business. 
Our results are being pressured by subscriber losses on our legacy iDEN network, which does not support the high speed data applications sought by many of our current and potential subscribers. Our consolidated operating revenues declined by 19% from the combined period ended December 31, 2015 to 2016 due to a 15% decrease in our consolidated subscriber base during 2016, almost all of which was driven by the 47% decrease in our iDEN subscriber base, and a 5% decline in the value of the Brazilian real compared to the U.S. dollar over the same period. While we were able to reduce our operating expenses by 30% in 2016, we generated an operating loss for the period, primarily as a result of a $1.34 billion non-cash asset impairment charge we recorded in 2016 to reduce the carrying values of Nextel Brazil's long-lived assets to their respective fair values. We expect continued subscriber losses on our iDEN network and the current economic conditions in Brazil to continue to impact our results of operations for the foreseeable future. 
As a result of the weak economy and challenging competitive environment in Brazil, we implemented and will continue to implement changes in our business to better align our organization and costs with our operational and financial results. These have included changes to our leadership team in Brazil in 2015, lower investments in costs to support subscriber growth, significant reductions in our headquarters staff through the reorganization of the roles and responsibilities of both our Brazil and corporate teams, and headcount reductions in Brazil, all of which are designed to reduce costs while maintaining the support necessary to meet our subscribers' needs. While some of these initiatives have led to better operating results, the challenges we face in Brazil, together with our debt service requirements, are placing significant pressure on our ability to fund our business beyond the first quarter of 2018. As a result, in February 2017, we and the lenders of our local bank loans in Brazil entered into amendments to these loan agreements under which principal payments will be suspended for four months while we seek to obtain long-term modifications of the financing arrangements, including potential further extensions of the existing amortization relief. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — D. Future Capital Needs and Resources — Covenants Under Financing Arrangements" for more information. In addition, last year, we hired a third party investment adviser to actively explore strategic options to provide sources of funding that will allow us to meet our future obligations or find a buyer for our company. While we continue to be focused on effectively managing our business in Brazil, the long-term viability of our business is dependent on the successful outcome of one or more of the external processes described above. 
Economic Environment
Brazil continues to experience one of the worst economic recessions in its history. During 2016, the Brazilian economy contracted as domestic demand decreased due to a combination of relatively high inflation, high interest rates, growing unemployment, tighter credit conditions, a decline in business investments and political issues. According to reports issued by the International Monetary Fund, or the IMF, it is estimated that Brazil's gross domestic product, or GDP, fell about 3% in 2016 compared to 2015, and most economic forecasts currently project GDP growth of no more than 1% in 2017. In addition, the unemployment rate in Brazil was about 11% at the end of 2016. Real wages in Brazil have been falling since March 2015 and are expected to continue to fall. The foreign currency exchange rate in Brazil declined in value by almost 5% relative to the U.S. dollar from 2015 to 2016. These economic conditions are affecting the wireless telecommunications industry in Brazil, leading to lower customer credit and pressure on customer demand, pricing and customer turnover. Consumer confidence improved in late 2016 but remains at lower levels than those experienced in recent prior years.
Competitive Environment
We believe that the wireless communications industry in Brazil has been and will continue to be characterized by intense competition on the basis of price, the types of services offered, speed of data access and quality of service. In recent years, the prices we have been able to charge for services in Brazil have declined as a result of intensified price competition, including the introduction by our competitors of aggressive pricing promotions, such as plans that allow shared minutes between groups of callers. Beginning in the second half of 2015 and continuing in 2016, our competitors in Brazil began introducing even more aggressive pricing plans that provided more services and in some cases, unlimited calling, for lower rates than some of the plans we offer. This increased competition may continue to affect our ability to attract and retain subscribers in the future.

We compete with large, well-capitalized competitors in Brazil that have substantial financial and other resources. Nextel Brazil's largest competitors are Vivo, which is owned by Spain's Telefonica and has the largest market share in the São Paulo metropolitan area and Rio de Janeiro; Claro, which is controlled by Mexico's America Movil; Telecom Italia Mobile, or TIM, a subsidiary of Italy's Telecom Italia; and TNL PCS S.A., a subsidiary of Telemar Norte Leste, Brazil's largest wireline incumbent, that offers its services under the brand name "Oi." 
Many of our competitors have a larger spectrum position than ours, including more spectrum that can be used to support a wide range of wireless technologies, and have greater coverage areas and/or name recognition than we do, making it easier for them to expand into new markets and offer new products and services. Our competitors typically have more extensive distribution channels than ours or are able to use their scale advantages to acquire subscribers at a lower cost than we can, and most of them have implemented network technology upgrades, including both WCDMA and LTE, that support high speed data services. Some of these competitors also have the ability to offer bundled telecommunications services that include local, long distance, subscription television and data services, and can offer a larger variety of handsets and other devices with a wide range of prices, brands and features. In addition, the financial strength and operating scale of some of these competitors allows them to offer aggressive pricing plans, including those targeted at attracting our existing subscribers.
In recent years, our largest competitors have increasingly focused their marketing efforts on attracting postpaid subscribers within our target segments by, among other things, enhancing their network quality and their customer care functions, which may minimize the value of our network quality and speed (for our WCDMA network) and the quality of our customer service as points of differentiation. In addition, as we have pursued our plans to extend our target market to include more high-value consumers, we are increasingly competing more directly for subscribers that are also targeted by our largest competitors.
We compete with other communications service providers based primarily on our simple and attractive pricing plans, high quality customer experience and differentiated wireless service offerings. We are continuing to pursue our target market with an expanded message that focuses on our transition to a full service wireless operator capable of providing high quality and high speed data services supported by our WCDMA network. Since our legacy iDEN network does not support high speed data applications, we are experiencing higher levels of migrations to lower price rate plans both within our iDEN network and from our iDEN network to our WCDMA network.
We believe that the users who primarily make up our targeted subscriber base are likely to base their purchase decisions on network quality and quality of customer support, as well as on the availability of differentiated features and services that make it easier for them to communicate quickly, efficiently and economically. However, because pricing is one of a number of important factors in potential customers' purchasing decisions, and in light of the economic conditions discussed above, increased price competition in the customer segments we target could require us to decrease prices or increase service and product offerings, which would lower our revenues, increase our costs or both.
In response to recent trends in Brazil's competitive environment, as well as the current economic climate, we have been taking the following actions:

• | increasing our focus on high value customer segments in order to generate higher levels of ARPU;


• | launching a new fully digital distribution channel that enables subscribers to purchase, activate and customize their plans through an online application;


• | furthering cost reduction strategies in order to continue to lower cash costs per user and improve overall profitability;


• | continuing to streamline distribution channels, including closing unprofitable retail stores;


• | continuing to migrate subscribers from our legacy iDEN network to our WCDMA network;


• | reviewing commission and subsidy strategies;


• | eliminating non-critical capital expenditures;


• | further utilizing sales strategies that incentivize subscribers to use their existing handsets when purchasing our services to keep subscriber acquisition costs at manageable levels;


• | harvesting the profitability of our legacy iDEN network;


• | streamlining our headquarters operations; and


• | continuing to pursue initiatives to maintain and enhance our existing liquidity.

Our Networks and Wireless Technologies
We currently offer services supported by a network that utilizes WCDMA technology. WCDMA is a standards-based technology being deployed by wireless carriers throughout the world that provides service capabilities such as high speed internet access, increased network capacity and reduced costs for voice and data services when compared to previous technologies. 
In late 2010, Nextel Brazil participated in a series of spectrum auctions and was the successful bidder for 20 megahertz, or MHz, of spectrum in the 1.9/2.1 gigahertz, or GHz, spectrum bands in 11 of the 13 auction lots covering approximately 98% of the Brazlian population for $714.4 million based on foreign currency exchange rates at the time. Nextel Brazil also successfully bid on 20 MHz of spectrum in the 1.8 GHz band in Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and some states in the north and northeast regions of Brazil for a total bid price of approximately $121.7 million. Nextel Brazil is utilizing this 1.9/2.1 GHz spectrum to support its WCDMA network and is utilizing the 1.8 GHz spectrum to support the deployment of the LTE-based network in Rio de Janeiro. The licenses relating to the spectrum won by Nextel Brazil in the auction were granted in June 2011 and have a term of 15 years. These licenses are renewable once for an additional 15-year period and require Nextel Brazil to meet specified network coverage construction requirements within specified timeframes. In December 2015, Nextel Brazil participated in a spectrum auction and was the successful bidder for 30 MHz of spectrum in the 1.8 GHz band for 455.0 million Brazilian reais, or approximately $116.7 million based on foreign currency exchange rates at the time. Nextel Brazil currently offers LTE services in Rio de Janeiro, and starting in December 2016, in São Paulo. These services are automatically available to subscribers with an existing mobile plan and compatible smartphone.
As we continue to transition from our legacy iDEN network to our WCDMA network, we will evaluate ways in which we can use our 800 MHz spectrum to support existing or new services. Our current 800 MHz spectrum holdings are largely contiguous, making it possible to use that spectrum to support future technologies, including LTE-based technologies, if certain technical, operational and regulatory requirements are met, including, for example, the availability of compatible network and subscriber equipment. The availability of that equipment will likely depend upon a number of factors, including the technology decisions made by other wireless carriers and the willingness of infrastructure and device manufacturers to produce the required equipment. 
We also continue to offer services supported by our network that utilizes the legacy iDEN technology developed and designed by Motorola. The iDEN technology is a digital technology that is able to operate on non-contiguous spectrum frequencies, was previously usable only for two-way radio calls and is a proprietary technology that relies solely on the efforts of Motorola and any future licensees of this technology for product development and innovation. The iDEN technology is also based on an earlier technology platform that is not capable of transmitting the volume of data at speeds that are supported by current technologies like WCDMA. In addition, the more limited worldwide deployment of the iDEN technology makes services offered on the iDEN network less attractive to subscribers who travel internationally because most of the iDEN handsets that we offer are currently designed to roam only on iDEN wireless networks.
Sales and Distribution 
Our target customers include consumer market segments that value our attractive pricing plans, high quality network and our superior level of customer service, as well as the small, medium and large business markets that value our differentiated wireless communications, including our push-to-talk services. We use a variety of distribution channels to reach our target customers, including direct sales representatives, indirect sales agents, retail stores and kiosks, and other subscriber-convenient sales channels such as online purchasing. Nextel Brazil is continuously optimizing the mix of sales channels to take into consideration the methods that best meet local subscriber preferences, most cost effectively sell and provide support to our different segments and facilitate our overall strategy of attracting and retaining subscribers in our targeted segments.
We employ sales representatives who market our services directly to potential and existing customers. The focus of our direct sales force is primarily on customers that value our industry expertise and differentiated services, as well as our ability to develop tailored custom communications capabilities that meet the specific needs of these customers. We also utilize indirect sales agents, which mainly consist of local and national non-affiliated dealers that solicit customers for our service and are generally paid through commissions. These dealers participate with Nextel Brazil's direct sales force in varying degrees in pursuing each of our targeted customer groups.
Our sales channels also include distribution through subscriber-convenient channels, including telesales and sales through our Nextel retail stores, shopping center kiosks and other locations. With the expansion of services on our WCDMA network, we have realigned these sales channels and locations and have also expanded our marketing through regional and national retailers with store kiosks and handset and prepaid card distribution offers. We also utilize our website as a marketing tool that allows subscribers to compare our various rate plans and research our suite of products and services, including handsets, accessories and special promotions. We use online purchases as an additional sales channel to allow subscribers to purchase our services directly. In December 2016, Nextel Brazil launched Happy, a digital platform that allows customers to customize each aspect of their plan. Happy provides for the sale of both broadband and voice mobile telecommunications services through one application without

any interaction with a Nextel representative. Subscribers can purchase a subscriber identity module, or SIM, card at an accredited point of sale, install the SIM card on an Android or iOS smartphone, download the application, and activate and change rate plans.
Marketing
We are a full service provider of wireless services, offering our customers packages of services and features that combine multiple communications services in one handset, including voice and data services and our differentiated push-to-talk services. Since 2002, we have offered services under the Nextel brand under a trademark license agreement with Nextel Communications, Inc. In 2011, we launched a new brand identity, which we believe enhanced the recognition of our brand and unified our brand identity. As a result of our efforts, the Nextel brand is recognized in Brazil as standing for both quality of service and the differentiated services and customer support we provide. With the launch of services supported by our WCDMA and LTE network, our marketing strategy has focused on the availability of the broader range of services and features that appeal to a wider range of consumers. This positioning of our brand continues to focus on customers who are attracted to our differentiated services and our reputation for providing a high quality customer experience. 
Regulation of SMR and PCS Operations
In Brazil, the wireless communications regulations are based on a concept called calling party pays, which requires the mobile carrier of the subscriber initiating a call to pay the mobile carrier of the party receiving the call when mobile calls occur between subscribers of different carriers. These calling party pays charges are based on rates that we refer to as mobile termination rates. In 2012, ANATEL, Brazil's telecommunications regulatory agency, approved regulations to implement a transition to a cost-based model for determining mobile termination rates. Under the current regulations, the mobile termination rates are being gradually reduced over a transition period ending in 2019, when cost-based rates will take effect. The transition rules also provide for a partial "bill and keep" settlement process that applies to the settlement of mobile termination charges between smaller operators like Nextel Brazil and its larger competitors (who are considered to hold significant market power under the Brazilian regulations), which further reduces mobile termination charges for smaller operators. The lower costs resulting from this partial bill and keep settlement process, which is similar to the settlement process that has historically applied to termination charges relating to Nextel Brazil’s iDEN services, decline as mobile termination rates are reduced during the transition period, with the bill and keep settlement process terminating when cost-based rates are implemented.
Under the rules adopted by ANATEL relating to interconnection charges, Nextel Brazil has negotiated agreements with all significant fixed line and wireless operators in Brazil to reflect the payments between carriers as a result of the calling party pays charges. Because Nextel Brazil's subscriber base is smaller than those of its competitors and its subscribers tend to make a higher number of calls terminating on other carriers' networks, these higher mobile termination rates result in substantial charges relating to the "off-net" termination of calls by our subscribers. To partially address this issue, ANATEL implemented the partial bill and keep settlement process described above. Since the adoption of this process, Nextel Brazil has recognized significant cost savings when terminating calls originated on its networks. In the past, these cost savings enabled Nextel Brazil to develop and offer attractive pricing plans that reduced or eliminated the significant differentiation in the cost of on-net and off-net calls that are common in Brazil due to the historically high mobile termination rates there, providing opportunities for Nextel Brazil to offer unique service plans. In connection with ANATEL’s transition plan, Nextel Brazil’s benefits under these partial bill and keep rules has declined, and recently, some of Nextel Brazil’s competitors have launched pricing plans with the same rates for on-net and off-net calls. In addition, in December 2015, two of Nextel Brazil’s competitors filed a lawsuit against ANATEL challenging the bill and keep rules. These competitors received an initial preliminary injunction, which was suspended after Anatel filed an appeal. A decision has not yet been made regarding the preliminary injunction or the lawsuit.

Foreign Currency Controls, Dividends and Tax Regulation
The purchase and sale of foreign currency in Brazil continues to be subject to regulation by the Central Bank of Brazil despite regulatory changes enacted in 2005 that were designed to reduce the level of government regulation of foreign currency transactions. Exchange rates are freely negotiated by the parties, but purchase of currency for repatriation of capital invested in Brazil and for payment of dividends to foreign stockholders of Brazilian companies may only be made if the original investment of foreign capital and capital increases were registered with the Brazilian Central Bank. There are no significant restrictions on the repatriation of registered share capital and remittance of dividends. Nextel Brazil has registered substantially all of its investments with the Brazilian Central Bank.
Brazilian law provides that the Brazilian government may, for a limited period of time, impose restrictions on the remittance by Brazilian companies to foreign investors of the proceeds of investments in Brazil. These restrictions may be imposed whenever there is a material imbalance or a serious risk of a material imbalance in Brazil’s balance of payments. The Brazilian government may also impose restrictions on the conversion of Brazilian currency into foreign currency. These restrictions may hinder or prevent us from purchasing equipment required to be paid for in any currency other than Brazilian reais. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 2,645 employees, of which 2,618 were employees of Nextel Brazil. Nextel Brazil is a party to a legally mandated collective bargaining agreement that covers most of its employees and expires on August 31, 2017. NII Holdings is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement. We believe that the relationship between us and our employees, and between Nextel Brazil and its employees, is good.
