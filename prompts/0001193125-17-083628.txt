 Our consultants are expected to travel and to be onsite with the customer to provide the highest level of service and support in all of these endeavors. We provide varying degrees of customer project assistance and will incorporate customer resources for technology transfer or cost optimization purposes. Independent teams and proper project process and delineation provide conflict-free transition points among all key service offerings as well as independent entry points. Leads for all offerings are internally driven with assistance from the respective vendors for software product solutions. 
 Customers 
 Our strategic acquisitions have helped enhance our service and product offerings, increase and diversify our customer base and reduce our reliance on individually significant customers. Service revenue from our five largest customers, as a percentage of total service revenue, was 15.2%, 11.8% and 17.8% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. No single customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014. See Item 1A.  Risk Factors  Our results can be subject to variability as work is completed for a limited number of significant customers, and our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected by the loss of a major customer or significant 
 
- 6 - 
 
 project or the failure to collect a large account receivable. During 2016, we recorded service revenue from 670 customers, of which 140 were new customers, as compared to recording service revenue from 667 customers in 2015, of which 139 were new customers. We recorded service revenue from 403 customers in 2014, of which 83 were new customers. Total customers served and new customers added during 2015 benefited from the acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of Zero2Ten, Inc. (Zero2Ten), Branchbird LLC (Branchbird) and M2 Dynamics Inc. (M2 Dynamics). Specifically, the higher volume and lower cost revenue model of Zero2Ten was a driving force behind the yearly increase in these metrics. 
 Industry Dynamics and Opportunity 
 Industry Dynamics.    In todays rapidly shifting macro business environment, businesses are demanding that financial and operational strategies be implemented in the most efficient and complete manner possible. The classic providers, such as the large management consulting firms, large accounting firms and multinational integrators, tend to provide solution services exclusively on large complex platforms, encompassing many players of mixed experience levels and in a myriad of locations. Edgewaters services are focused and quickly deployed onsite in a specialized solution package, more appropriate to todays need for faster innovation rollout, pushed deeper into subsidiaries of multinational corporations as well as middle market growth companies. 
 Expenditures in the information technology market have become a critical success factor in every companys successful growth. As such, IT expenditures are receiving the scrutiny of the C-level officers, when specifically focused on transformational change. Our C-level buyers are looking to purchase rapidly deployable, risk-managed, product-based technology solutions. These solutions maintain the ability for a company to differentiate itself from its competitors with proprietary business process, combined with the leverage of product customization. Edgewater assists clients with these solutions primarily in the Oracle Corporation (Oracle) and Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) product channels, while providing the opportunity for a customer to customize its solutions through the utilization of its custom technology consulting services. 
 In addition, there are three drivers of incremental change for early adopters: big data and analytics, digital transformation, and large scale cloud adoption. The first driver provides deeper data sources, as well as external reference data to expand and improve enterprise analytics. Digital transformation offers platform agnostic near real-time input for transactions and corporate command and control, breaking the paper-based paradigm which has driven automation to date. The third driver, large scale cloud adoption, increases the penetration of the cloud-based delivery model into larger companies and typically on premise classical systems. These incremental change drivers are catalysts for opportunity in our product channels as well as for our classical consulting resources. Edgewater plans to aggressively exploit these opportunities via organic initiatives as well as strategic alternatives. 
 Companies typically turn to consulting firms, like Edgewater, to fill these internal project gaps for a number of reasons: 
 

◾ | For deep industry, product, data and technical expertise;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


◾ | To obtain strategic consulting services in an accelerated timeframe;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | To mitigate their business risk with focused onsite project teams;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | To receive an outside objective perspective;
--+---------------------------------------------


◾ | To obtain EPM- and EIM-related services;
--+-----------------------------------------


◾ | To obtain product, services and IP related to ERP and CRM;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


◾ | To provide cloud architecture and on-ramping services; and/or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | To serve as an agent to plan, manage and implement change.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

 Industry Opportunity.    Technology has become such an integral part of business that it requires skilled strategic management in its own right. Technology has become a key enabler to business change when the appropriate strategic steps, a meld of business process change and technology, are well laid out and thoughtfully 
 
- 7 - 
 
 executed. Strategic consulting firms deliver innovative thinking and in-depth vertical industry expertise, along with the ability to implement business process transformation through the judicious use of appropriate technologies. We have steadily enhanced our offerings to address the evolving need for strategic advisory and product-based consulting services and plan to continue to grow our competencies in these areas. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive continuum of focused business services, encompassing all facets of business, through the enablement of technology. 
 Competitive Strengths

----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business Strategy 
 Our business strategy is to position our Company as one of the leading providers of transformational classic and product-based consulting services. We believe we can attain this strategic objective by delivering a range of blended solutions through a combination of industry specific classic consulting, advanced productbased software consulting and custom technology consulting services. Clients desire the personal attention provided by onsite industry, financial and strategic expertise buttressed with the ability to speed idea implementation with cost-effective advanced software package solutions. Our ability to begin our services dialogue at the strategy level in business vernacular all the way through specific software product request for proposal response provides a spectrum of sales opportunities with varying degrees of channel control and cost. This spectrum of engagement entry opportunities allows us to serve the upper middle market through the Global 2000 with an appropriate set of services. 
 The spectrum begins with pure consulting and ends with pure information technology. Smaller organizations such as middle-market companies, subsidiaries of Global 2000, private equity firms and venture capital firms will tend to start at the advisory and classic consulting level, while the Global 2000 tend to initially engage with product-based consulting services. 
 Additionally, we are able to strengthen our service offerings by focusing upon the development of intellectual property, not only in the area of trademarks, as described below under  Intellectual Property, but with respect to the internal development of software. We are able to quickly execute on the internal development of intellectual property given the significant knowledge and expertise we maintain in our product-based consulting channels. We can leverage this intellectual property as a means to accelerate delivery of a solution and as a means to solidify and/or expand our presence in a vertical market. 
 Marketing, Sales and Strategic Alliances 
 Marketing.    The primary goal of our marketing efforts is to generate sales opportunities by increasing our brand awareness, value proposition and overall domain expertise. Our marketing efforts continue to be closely aligned with our go-to-market strategy, while introducing specific offerings that address business and IT problems faced by our clients. We leverage the core competencies we have developed in delivering our services in key industries and horizontal offerings to increase the efficiency of our marketing efforts. Our marketing function utilizes comprehensive internet marketing strategies that involve integrated activities including, but not limited to: webinars, highly-targeted email campaigns distributed to prospect and client lists developed with specific demographics and attributes and social media outlets to promote our capabilities and services (e.g., both company-driven and domain-specific blogs, social networking and video sharing websites). By leveraging closely coupled internet marketing strategies to promote our services, we are able to reach a wider audience and communicate in a medium that has become more widely accepted and brings in quicker results from a sales and marketing perspective. We also gather key statistics from our websites, blogs, email campaigns and other social media outlets to test, measure and trace our marketing initiatives. This enables us to ensure we are reaching the right target audience with concise and compelling offerings to promote our capabilities. We also author white papers and contribute to articles in trade publications, attend events and participate in targeted industry conferences and tradeshows. 
 Our marketing department has embarked on an enterprise-wide initiative to bring recent acquisitions under a single master brand concept. Since some of our new offerings are not purely technology oriented, we are in the process of establishing our master brand as Edgewater, thus dropping the word Technology from our corporate identity. 
 Sales.    Our sales approach is to combine traditional sales with our strength in industries and technology. Our traditional sales function is composed of direct sales professionals and inside sales professionals. Both work closely with our practice directors to identify potential opportunities within each account. Using a consultative selling methodology, we identify target prospects and develop a pursuit plan for each key account. When contact 
 
- 9 - 
 
 with a target is established, we utilize a blended sales model to demonstrate our expertise, combining consultative selling with traditional sales methods. Once the customer has engaged us, our sales professionals maintain their relationships with the customer by working collaboratively with the consulting professionals who are assigned to the customer. 
 Strategic Alliances.    As part of our sales and marketing effort, we have established working relationships with a number of companies, including: Informatica Corporation, Keyteach, Microsoft, Oracle, FAST, Cloudera, Hortonworks, SiteCore, Accelatis, Amazon, and Webtrends. These alliances generally entail sharing sales leads, joint marketing efforts, making joint customer presentations, negotiating discounts on license fees or other charges and conducting similar activities. Our arrangements with many of these companies are informal and are not subject to definitive written agreements. For those companies with whom we do have definitive written agreements, those agreements are either terminable at will by either party or are for terms of one year or less. We believe we have been successful in establishing alliances with a strong group of companies who are either industry leaders or well-regarded new entrants. 
Professional Recruitment, Retention and Development 
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to recruit and retain business and technology professionals with the high level of skills and experience needed to provide our specialty services. We believe that the combination of professional support, intellectual challenge, corporate culture and compensation we offer will continue to be attractive to these highly-skilled professionals. Our working environment also fosters collaboration, creativity and innovation. We believe that our employees are one of our most valuable assets. 
 Employees.    As of December 31, 2016, Edgewater had 465 employees (excluding contractors). Of these employees, 359 were billable consultants and 106 were management and administrative personnel (composed of sales, marketing, human resources, finance, accounting, internal information systems and administrative support) and product development personnel. The average tenure of our employees is approximately 6 years and the average years of experience is approximately 23 years. Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our employee relations are strong. 
 Culture.    We believe that our business culture is critically important in hiring and retaining qualified professionals. Our ability to provide effective multidisciplinary teams is dependent upon our ability to develop and sustain a business culture that is common across all disciplines and vertical practices throughout our Company. Our employees are talented and energetic professionals who come from a multitude of professional backgrounds. We believe that this creates an exciting, diverse and creative work environment for our employees. 
 Compensation.    We have competitive compensation programs that have been structured to attract and retain highly-skilled professionals. Edgewaters compensation programs include competitive base salaries, coupled with cash bonus and equity-based incentive opportunities. Compensation plans may be tied to the achievement of the Companys financial performance or tied to individual and team performance goals. 
 Recruiting.    We believe that our long-term success will depend upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly-skilled employees. Our recruitment department has traditionally conducted its own direct recruiting efforts and coordinated informal and search firm referrals. We believe that our business model, which results in an intellectually stimulating work environment, provides increased opportunities for professional development and a dynamic corporate culture, which enhances our ability to attract and retain top professionals. 
 Professional Development.    We believe that providing our professionals with a wide variety of challenging projects, the opportunity to demonstrate ability and achieve professional advancement are keys to their retention. We work with our professionals to assist them with their professional development by offering internal and external learning opportunities. We encourage them to attain industry certifications which strengthen their expertise in both business and technology. We also believe that the working relationships they form on various project teams foster valuable formal and informal mentoring and knowledge sharing.

Competition 
 We operate in a competitive and rapidly changing market. We also compete with a variety of organizations that offer services similar to those we provide. Our clients often retain us on a non-exclusive, project-by-project basis. We compete with a number of different types of businesses, including: 
 Traditional management and strategy consulting firms that focus on advising C-level executives on organization and corporate strategy. Many of the traditional strategic consulting firms have added services in information technology. 
 Systems integration and IT consulting firms that design and implement technology solutions, including software installation, for departments and enterprises. These firms have grown in size and scope of services, including the provision of offshore software development services. 
 Information technology product and service vendors that offer technical consulting to support their own products. Many of these firms have also developed various alliances with systems integration and IT consulting firms to augment their own capabilities. 
 There is significant competition in the management and IT consulting services space. Mergers or consolidations in our market may create new, larger or better-capitalized competitors with enhanced abilities to attract and retain professionals. The following is a representative list of competitors in the IT and management consulting services space: 
 

◾ | Technical Consulting/Systems integrators: Accenture, Ciber, Inc., IBM Global Services, Business and Decision Group, Caritor, Inc., CGI, and Perficient;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Offshore software development firms: Aztec Software, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Infosys, Ventyx, Tech Mahindra, Tata and Wipro;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Management/Business Consulting firms: Bain & Company, Booz-Allen & Hamilton, Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey & Company;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Enterprise Resource Planning firms: SAP, Oracle, Hitachi, Tribridge and Avanade;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Enterprise Performance Management / Business Activity Monitoring / Business Intelligence providers: Deloitte & Touche, Huron, The Hackett Group, Hitachi Consulting Corporation, KPI Partners, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst & Young; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Computer hardware, software and service vendors: Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Oracle, Microsoft and SAP.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that the principal criteria considered by prospective clients when selecting a consulting firm include skills and capabilities of consultants, scope of services, project methodology and approach, technical and industry expertise, reputation and quality of past work, perceived value and a commitment to delivering a solution that works as intended. Due to our ongoing dedication and attention to all of the above characteristics, we believe that we are well positioned against our competitors in our marketplace. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We consider our intellectual property to be a valuable asset in a highly competitive industry. We also consider our intellectual property to be an important factor in building brand recognition for quality service and performance. Therefore, we have secured certain service marks for Edgewater, Edgewater Consulting, Edgewater Technology, Edgewater Strategy Services, Edgewater Technology-Ranzal, Edgewater Ranzal and Edgewater Fullscope, among others. We believe we have secured all rights to trademarks and trade names related to our business. 
 
- 11 - 
 
We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights. In particular, we require each of our employees to sign an invention and non-disclosure agreement, which provides that they must maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property and that any intellectual property that they develop while employed by us is the property of Edgewater. We have developed detailed tools, processes and methodologies which are used in developing software code, scripts, libraries, data models, applications, business processes, frameworks and other technology used within our Company and in customer engagements. See also Item 1A.  Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Potential Future Strategies, Transactions and Changes 
 Critical to our ability to create long-term stockholder value, the Company will continue to pursue internal growth initiatives and appropriate business combination transaction alternatives to achieve growth in revenues and profitability. From time to time, we have engaged and we may continue to engage in discussions with various persons regarding potential business combination transactions. 
 We believe that our current cash balances and our anticipated cash flow from our operations taken together will be adequate for our working capital needs for at least the next twelve months. However, our actual experience may differ significantly from our expectation, particularly if we pursue growth through business combination transactions. In addition, other future events may adversely or materially affect our business, expenses or prospects and could affect our available cash or the availability or cost of external financial resources. 
 We may, in the future, purchase common stock in the open market, in private transactions or otherwise, pursuant to board approved repurchase programs. See Item 5.  Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Any future purchases by us will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the market price of our common stock, our business strategy, our business and financial position and general economic and market conditions.
