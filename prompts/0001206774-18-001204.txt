General Information
 Midwest Holding Inc. (“Midwest,” the “Company,” “Registrant,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was formed in Nebraska in 2003 to become a financial services holding company. The Company’s sole operating subsidiary, American Life & Security Corp. (“American Life”), was formed in 2009 as a Nebraska-domiciled life insurance company.
 The principal executive offices for Midwest and American Life are at 2900 South 70th Street, Suite 400, Lincoln, Nebraska 68506, phone number is (402) 489-8266.
 Development of Our Business
 We raised capital to build Midwest through various exempt intra-state offerings between 2003 and 2009. Since that time, Midwest has acquired eight other small holding company/life insurance companies and consolidated them with Midwest and American Life such that commencing December 31, 2016, Midwest operated its life insurance business exclusively through American Life.
 In 2009, American Life began conducting life insurance business in Nebraska. As of December 31, 2017, statutory capital and surplus of American Life was approximately $3.0 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, American Life generated approximately $5.2 million and $5.9 million, respectively, in premium revenue on a statutory accounting basis.
 Acquisitions and Divestitures Since 2014
 On July 21, 2014, we consummated an exchange agreement with Great Plains Financial Corporation, a South Dakota corporation (“Great Plains”) and Security Capital Corporation, an Arkansas corporation (“Security Capital”), acquiring the outstanding shares of each company held by their shareholders (other than those shares already held by us). Shortly thereafter, Great Plains and Security Capital were merged into us. We issued a total of 4,120,000 voting common shares pursuant to these transactions. On December 1, 2016, the former principal subsidiary of Great Plains, Great Plains Life Assurance Company (“Great Plains Life”), a life insurance company, was merged into American life.
 On October 27, 2015, we acquired the shares of First Wyoming Capital Corporation, a Wyoming corporation (“First Wyoming”), not already owned by us by issuing approximately 4,767,000 shares to the former shareholders of First Wyoming. Subsequent to the closing, First Wyoming merged into us. On September 1, 2016, the former principal subsidiary of First Wyoming, First Wyoming Life Insurance Company (“First Wyoming Life”), was merged into American Life.
 On March 15, 2016, we acquired the outstanding shares of Northstar Financial Corp., a Minnesota corporation (“Northstar”). We issued approximately 4,553,000 shares in the transaction. Northstar’s primary asset at the time we acquired it was cash of approximately $2.4 million.

On August 29, 2016, we sold Capital Reserve to an unaffiliated party for $50,000 plus statutory capital and surplus.
 Effective September 30, 2017, American Life entered into an indemnity coinsurance transaction with US Alliance and Security Company (“US Alliance”) to transfer 100% of the risk related to the Great Plains Life and First Wyoming Life blocks of business. The purpose of this transaction was to provide statutory capital and surplus for American Life and had minimal effect on accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financials. We paid no commissions or brokerage fees for this transaction and the proceeds of the transaction were based upon valuations prepared by our third party actuary. Under the indemnity coinsurance, US Alliance assumed certain liabilities and obligations. As we are not relieved of our legal liability to the policyholders; the liabilities and obligations associated with the reinsured blocks of business remain on our Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding reinsurance receivable from US Alliance, which totaled $8,928,223 as of September 30, 2017. We transferred $9,629,623 of GAAP net adjusted reserves to US Alliance for cash of $7,078,223 which was net of a ceding allowance of $1,850,000 was treated as an increase to surplus on a statutory basis. As a result of the transaction, in addition to the reserves, American Life ceded approximately $883,000 of annual GAAP revenues and $1,758,250 of statutory revenues. US Alliance assumed all responsibilities for incurred claims, surrenders and commission from the effective date. See Note 6. 
 Life Insurance
 General
 American Life, as it exists today, is the product of a merger in 2010 of Old Reliance and American Life with Old Reliance surviving and being renamed American Life, the contribution of Great Plains Life to American Life in 2014 (which was merged into American Life on December 1, 2016), and the merger with First Wyoming Life into American Life on September 1, 2016. American Life is authorized to underwrite and market life insurance products within the State of Nebraska, and in 13 other states.
Insurance Policies
 American Life initially offered two insurance products, the “American Accumulator”, which is a multi-benefit life insurance policy that combines cash value ordinary life insurance with a tax deferred annuity and the “Protect America’s Future”, a single premium convertible term life product offered for children aged three months to 15 years. The Protect America’s Future is available in annual premium amounts of $125 or $250 and carries an initial face amount of $5,000 or $10,000. The American Accumulator is sold in annual premium units of $2,000. The average annual premium is approximately $2,000 with an average face amount of $62,000. Premiums may be higher based upon the age and health of the insured.
 Three new products were introduced in 2014: (i) the “Accelerator”, which is a participating whole life insurance policy with guaranteed level death benefits and premiums; (ii) the “American Protector”, a 7-year pay non-participating whole life insurance policy with an embedded flexible annuity and modified death and premiums; and (iii) the “Accumulator X”, a 10-year pay non-participating whole life insurance policy with an embedded flexible annuity and modified death benefit and premiums. The Accelerator premiums vary according to issue age, gender, and smoking classification with a minimum face amount of $25,000. Its premiums are substantially higher than the other products in the portfolio. The American Protector premiums are payable for seven years, during which time the face amount remains level. After the seven years the policy face amount gradually decreases to the ultimate amount which is equal to 50% of the issued policy face amount. Annual premiums per unit are $1,000 with a minimum of ½ a unit and maximum of ten units. After the first year, 30% of the annual premiums are allocated to the flexible annuity. The Accumulator X premiums are payable for ten years, during which time the policy face amount remains level. After ten years, the policy face amount gradually decreases to the ultimate amount which is equal to 50% of the issued policy face amount. Annual premiums per unit are $1,000 with a minimum of ½ a unit and maximum of ten units. After the first year, 40% of the annual premiums are allocated to the flexible premium annuity.

Product Pricing
 Our products have been approved by the appropriate insurance regulatory authorities and incorporate the following features:
 
● | Provide a competitively priced product to the insurance consumer; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Provide sufficient gross margins to us based upon achieving projected levels of volume to allow the insurance subsidiary to achieve operating profits comparable to the life insurance industry as a whole; and
● | Provide sufficient first year and renewal commission structures necessary to attract and retain career-oriented insurance agents. 

 All of our products were developed using the services of an independent qualified consulting actuary, Miller and Newberg, Inc., of Kansas City, Missouri. In addition to product development, Miller and Newberg, Inc., serves as valuation actuary to American Life. The Company utilizes a third party firm, First Consulting Inc. of Kansas City, Missouri, for product compliance and filings with various regulatory authorities.
 Underwriting Standards
 Underwriting guidelines have a direct impact on the operating results of American Life. If the underwriting standards that are established are not adequate, desired operating results will not be realized. Generally, when underwriting standards are less restrictive, more mortality claims and lower persistency will result. Underwriting standards have a direct impact on the pricing structure of a product. The less restrictive the underwriting standards, the higher the product needs to be priced in order to allow for higher incidence of mortality. This higher incidence of mortality is also reflected in greater policy reserves being established.
 American Life utilizes information from applications and, in some cases, telephone interviews with applicants, inspection reports, doctors’ statements and/or medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with an application, with a different rating, with a rider, with reduced coverage or rejected. In addition to an applicant’s medical history, American Life also considers other factors such as financial profile, foreign travel, vocations and alcohol, drug and tobacco use. Requests for coverage are reviewed on their merits and a policy is not issued unless the particular risk has been examined and approved by our underwriters. Miller and Newberg, Inc., and reinsurers assist American Life in establishing its underwriting standards. The Company’s Chief Underwriter has more than 20 years’ experience in such business.
 Marketing
 The insurance products of American Life are marketed using a personal, face-to-face marketing concept. The insurance agents use the shareholder base and the current policyholders of ours and their referrals as potential clients for life insurance products. For most of 2017, we were unable to generate a significant amount of new life insurance sales due to the lack of excess capital and surplus of American Life.
 Candidate agents that lack insurance experience must complete a multiple interview process. These individuals are secured through a recruiting agency, referrals from shareholders, newspaper advertisements, and solicitation through the use of on-line job sites. If hired to sell insurance, the candidate must complete a 40-hour training course conducted by a third party as well as pass the applicable state examination. Once licensed, each agent must complete a week long product and sales training class. Following course completion, each agent has a training week where his or her manager will work side by side with the agent by conducting sales meetings.

Operating Results
 There are certain factors unique to the life insurance business in which we operate which have an adverse effect on our operating results. One factor is that the cost of putting a new policy in force is usually greater than the first year’s policy premium and, accordingly, in the early years of a new life insurance company, these initial costs and the required provisions for reserves have an adverse effect on operating results. American Life, as is common among relatively young life insurance companies, may be expected to sustain losses for several years until such time as the block of business matures and the profit stream offsets the cost of new business. The aggregate cost of writing new life insurance includes such significant, nonrecurring items such as first year commissions, medical and investigation expenses, and other expenses incidental to the issuance of new policies, together with the initial reserves required to be established. For our ordinary life products, the costs to cover expenses and the policyholder liability that must be set up at policy issuance exceed the first year premium by approximately 35%. Additionally, there is no excess of costs to cover expenses and the policyholder liability for the Protect America’s Future product. However, in accordance with GAAP, incremental direct costs that result directly from and are essential to a life insurance company acquisition transaction and would not have been incurred by us had the transaction not occurred, are capitalized and amortized over the life of the premiums produced.
 Our operating results are reported in accordance with GAAP for stock life companies; although American Life also prepares financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by its state of domicile (statutory basis of accounting) for the purpose of reporting to insurance regulatory authorities. The statutory basis of accounting has many significant differences to GAAP. For example, the incremental direct costs for acquiring new business, which are capitalized under GAAP, as discussed in the preceding paragraph, are expensed immediately under the statutory basis of accounting. In addition, under GAAP, assumptions used in calculating reserves are less conservative than those used under the statutory basis, thereby further reducing adverse effects on operating results.
 Administration
 We commenced our third party administrative (“TPA”) services in 2012 as an additional revenue source. These services were offered to American Life through February 28, 2017, and to non-consolidated entities. These agreements, for various levels of administrative services on behalf of each company, generate fee income for us. Services provided to each company vary based on their needs and can include some or all aspects of back-office accounting and policy administration. We have been able to perform our TPA services using our existing in-house resources. Management does not expect such service to be a significant source of future revenue.
Investments
 The type and amount of investments which can be made by a life insurance company are specifically controlled by applicable state statutes and rules and regulations of the respective state departments of insurance. American Life has adopted investment policies in compliance with the insurance laws of the State of Nebraska.
 As an unseasoned company ages, investment income will increase as a percent of total income due to investment of policy reserves; therefore, it is critical that an insurer invests its assets conservatively to ensure that investment income can become a significant component of total revenue. Accordingly, American Life has developed a conservative investment policy in an effort to minimize investment risk. Our investments are managed by our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), who has over 30 years of portfolio management experience. He consults with a number of investment bankers and traders in the management of our portfolio. Trades are cleared through a common broker after competitive bids are solicited.
 Reinsurance
 American Life reinsures with other companies (reinsurers) portions of the life insurance risks it underwrites. The primary purpose of reinsurance is to allow a company to reduce the amount of its risk on any particular policy by transferring a portion of the risk to the reinsurers. However, American Life remains contingently liable for the risk in the event any reinsurer is not able to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreements. Further, when life insurance risks are ceded to another insurer, the ceding company must pay a reinsurance premium to the reinsurance company as consideration for the risk being transferred. The payment of this reinsurance premium to the reinsurer represents a reduction of the premium revenue received by American Life. This reduction in premium income has a direct impact on the profitability of the ceding company. The types of reinsurance treaties utilized are yearly renewable term based and indemnity coinsurance. For the yearly renewable term, we pay the assuming carrier an annual premium based upon “term life” rates which are typically lower than those we charge. The indemnity coinsurance reinsurer receives 100% of the premiums and benefits.

The average face amount of all of our life insurance policies in force is approximately $34,000, with the American Accumulator averaging $62,000, Protect America’s Future Plan averaging $9,000, the Accelerator averaging $81,000, the American Protector averaging $10,000, the Accumulator X averaging $77,000, and death benefit policies acquired averaging $9,000. With respect to the new policies written, American Life retains $40,000 of risk on any one life. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 36% of our gross outstanding life insurance policies in force are reinsured with third parties. Overall, ceded premium represents approximately $14.00 of premium per year for each $1,000 of gross life insurance in force. All accidental death benefits are reinsured.
 Reserves
 American Life establishes as liabilities actuarially computed reserves to meet the obligations on the policies it writes, in accordance with the insurance laws and the regulations of Nebraska, for statutory accounting and GAAP. Reserves, whether calculated under statutory accounting practices prescribed by various state insurance regulators or GAAP, do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates based on the relevant basis of accounting, generally involving actuarial projections, of what we expect claims will be based on mortality assumptions. The various actuarial factors are determined from mortality tables and interest rates in effect when the policies are issued and are applied against policy in force amounts. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has adopted reserve rules to be used for Statutory Accounting. As of January 31, 2017, 46 states adopted the revised model laws. The new method, referred to as Principle-Based Reserving (“PBR”) replaces the current formula approach on determining policy reserves to an approach that reflects the risk of highly complex products. American Life did not report life insurance reserves on a PBR basis at December 31, 2017 and is deferring to implement under the transitional rules stated in Section II of the Valuation Manual until January 1, 2020 for new policies written. We have not performed an analysis to determine the effect these new rules may have on us.
Competition
 The life insurance industry is fiercely competitive. Many of the life insurance companies authorized to do business in states that we conduct business in are well-established companies with good reputations, offer a broader line of insurance products, have larger selling organizations, and possessing significantly greater financial resources than Midwest and American Life. American Life is not rated by industry analysts and likely will not be rated for the foreseeable future. This has a negative impact on the ability of American Life to compete with rated insurance companies.
 There is also considerable competition among insurance companies in obtaining qualified sales agents, which might require American Life to pay higher commissions to attract such agents. We feel that we are uniquely positioned to serve our client base – primarily rural areas of the Midwest where competition from large companies is less intense due to geographic and economic constraints.

Certain Relationships and Affiliations
 The Company and certain of our directors and officers have current or past relationships and affiliations with businesses that operate, once operated, or plan to operate in the life insurance industry and that have conducted stock offerings in connection with their operations. Additional information on these relationships and affiliations, organized by company, is as follows: 
 Pacific Northwest: Pacific Northwest was incorporated in Idaho in October 2010 with the purpose of organizing a life insurance subsidiary in that state. Pacific Northwest is a dormant company with an insignificant amount of assets. There is no plan at this time to raise more capital or pursue forming a life insurance subsidiary. We own approximately 24.7%, or 850,000 shares, of Pacific Northwest common stock. Mark A. Oliver, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Midwest, is Treasurer and a member of the Board of Directors of Pacific Northwest and owns 100,000 shares of capital stock of Pacific Northwest. Todd C. Boeve, an officer of Midwest, is Secretary and a member of the Board of Directors of Pacific Northwest and owns 25,000 shares of capital stock of Pacific Northwest.
 New Mexico Capital: New Mexico Capital was incorporated in New Mexico in November 2010 with the purpose of organizing a life insurance subsidiary in that state. New Mexico Capital is a dormant company with an insignificant amount of assets. There is no plan at this time to raise more capital or pursue forming a life insurance subsidiary. Midwest owns 500,000 shares or approximately 11.5% of New Mexico Capital. Mark A. Oliver, the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Midwest, is Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of New Mexico Capital and owns 186,667 shares of its common stock or 4.3% of the outstanding common shares. Other of Midwest’s present and former officers and directors also own 381,667 shares of common stock of New Mexico Capital, or 9.0% of the outstanding shares.
Regulation
 American Life is subject to the regulation and supervision of the insurance regulatory authorities of Nebraska, and other state insurance regulators where it is licensed to do business. Such regulation is primarily for the benefit of policyholders rather than shareholders. These regulators possess broad administrative powers, including the power to grant and revoke licenses to transact business, to approve the form of insurance contracts, to regulate capital requirements, to regulate the character of permitted investments, and to require deposits for the protection of investments. These insurance laws require the filing of a detailed annual report with the department of insurance in each state, as do other states’ laws. The business and financial accounts of American Life are subject to examination by the Nebraska Department of Insurance, as well as insurance departments of any other states in which we may do business.
 As the holder of a controlling interest in American Life, we are also subject to regulation as an insurance holding company system under the insurance laws of the state of Nebraska. The provisions of these laws generally provide for restrictions on a change in control of the insurance holding company, requires the filing of certain reports with the relevant department of insurance, and limits the amount of dividends which may be received by the holding company.

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) became law. The Dodd-Frank Act reshapes financial regulations in the United States by creating new regulators, regulating new markets and firms, and providing new enforcement powers to regulators. Virtually all major areas of the Dodd-Frank Act will be subject to regulatory interpretation and implementation rules requiring rulemaking that may take several years to complete. Although the ultimate outcome of the regulatory rulemaking proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act or the regulations promulgated thereunder will have a material impact on our consolidated financial results or financial condition.
 Employees and Agents
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 20 full-time employees as well as approximately 79 insurance agents who operate as independent contractors.
