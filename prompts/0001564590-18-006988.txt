ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview 
 GI Dynamics® is a clinical stage medical device company focused on the development and commercialization of EndoBarrier, a medical device intended for treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity. 
 Diabetes mellitus type 2 (also known as type 2 diabetes) is a long-term progressive metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar, insulin resistance, and reduced insulin production. People with type 2 diabetes represent 90% of the worldwide diabetes population, whereas 10% of this population is diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (a form of diabetes mellitus in which not enough insulin is produced). 
 Being overweight is a condition where the patient’s body mass index (BMI) is greater than 25 (kg/m2); obesity is a condition where the patient’s BMI is greater than 30. Obesity and its comorbidities contribute to the progression of type 2 diabetes. Many experts believe obesity contributes to higher levels of insulin resistance, which creates a feedback loop that increases the severity of type 2 diabetes. 
 When considering treatment for type 2 diabetes, it is optimal to address obesity concurrently with diabetes. 
 EndoBarrier® is intended for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity in a minimally invasive and reversible manner. 
 The current treatment paradigm for type 2 diabetes is lifestyle therapy combined with pharmacological treatment, whereby treating clinicians prescribe a treatment regimen of one to four concurrent medications that could include insulin for patients with higher levels of blood sugar. Insulin carries a significant risk of increased mortality and may contribute to weight gain, which in turn may lead to higher levels of insulin resistance and increased levels of blood sugar. Fewer than 50% of patients treated pharmacologically for type 2 diabetes are adequately managed, meaning that medication does not lower blood sugar adequately and does not halt the progressive nature of diabetes of these patients. 
 The current pharmacological treatment algorithms for type 2 diabetes fall short of ideal, creating a large and unfilled treatment gap. 
 Our vision is to make EndoBarrier the essential nonpharmacological and non-anatomy-altering treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity. We intend to achieve this vision by providing a safe and effective device, focusing on optimal patient care, supporting treating clinicians, adding to the extensive body of clinical evidence around EndoBarrier, gaining appropriate regulatory approvals, continuing to improve our products and systems, operating the company in a lean fashion, and maximizing shareholder value. 
 EndoBarrier® is intended for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity in a minimally invasive and reversible manner and is designed to mimic the mechanism of action of duodenal-jejunal exclusion created by gastric bypass surgery.

The EndoBarrier system consists of three primary components: 
 
 
• | EndoBarrier — The EndoBarrier gastrointestinal liner is a 60-cm-long implant consisting of a thin, flexible, impermeable fluoropolymer sleeve coupled to a proprietary nitinol anchor assembly. A gastroenterologist (GI clinician) or bariatric or metabolic surgeon implants EndoBarrier into the patient’s duodenum in a minimally invasive manner using the EndoBarrier Delivery System. EndoBarrier is placed via endoscopy (through the mouth and esophagus and into the stomach without cutting tissue) during a procedure that typically takes less than twenty minutes. Once properly positioned in the patient’s upper intestine just below the stomach, the EndoBarrier Delivery System is removed and EndoBarrier remains, held in place by a proprietary anchoring mechanism. EndoBarrier remains in the body for a maximum intended duration of twelve months until removal, again via a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure using the EndoBarrier Removal System. The effect of EndoBarrier begins promptly after device placement.

• | EndoBarrier Delivery System — EndoBarrier is delivered using our proprietary single-use delivery system. This includes a sterile custom-made catheter 300 cm in length that is sufficiently flexible to be passed through the patient’s mouth, through the stomach, and into the intestine. EndoBarrier is provided prepacked in the EndoBarrier Delivery System inside a capsule at the distal end of the delivery catheter. EndoBarrier is deployed by the clinician using the delivery system controls at the proximal end of the system. The delivery procedure is brief, typically taking less than twenty minutes, during which the patient is either anaesthetized or semi-sedated.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | EndoBarrier Removal System — EndoBarrier is removed at the end of the treatment period via a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure using our proprietary grasper which passes through a standard gastroscope. The grasper is used to pull one of two drawstrings that connect to the EndoBarrier anchor assembly to collapse the anchor inward. As the drawstring is pulled, EndoBarrier collapses inward and the anchor system disengages from the wall of the duodenum. The retrieval hood, placed on the end of a gastroscope, allows the EndoBarrier anchor assembly to be pulled and collapsed into the hood and positioned to cover the anchor. The implant is then safely removed through the patient’s stomach, esophagus, and mouth. The EndoBarrier device is usually retrieved in a brief procedure typically taking less than twenty minutes, during which the patient is either anaesthetized or semi-sedated.

 EndoBarrier has been shown in multiple company-sponsored and independent clinical studies to lower blood sugar levels (hemoglobin A1c or HbA1c), reduce excess body weight, and positively affect other health metrics and comorbidities. 
 EndoBarrier is not currently approved or commercially available in any jurisdiction. In the United States, we must seek agreement from the FDA to conduct a clinical study under an investigational device exemption (IDE). To gain regulatory approval to commercialize EndoBarrier in the United States, we must submit a pre-market authorization (PMA) application for review and approval by the FDA.

Operations 
 We began selling EndoBarrier in Europe and South America in 2010 and in Australia in 2011. To date, we have distributed over 3,500 units of EndoBarrier and generated a total of $7.8 million in revenue. We have incurred net losses in each year since our inception. 
 We were incorporated in Delaware in 2003. We have raised net proceeds of approximately $234.4 million through sales of our equity of which $1.6 million was raised through our 2018 private placement offering. We generated $75.7 million in proceeds, net of expenses, through the sale of convertible preferred stock to a number of US venture capital firms, two global medical device manufacturers, and individuals prior to going public. In June 2011, we issued convertible term promissory notes to several of our shareholders totaling $6.0 million, which were repaid concurrently with the closing of our IPO in September 2011 with the associated gross proceeds. In September 2011, we raised approximately $72.5 million, net of expenses, and repaid $6.0 million of convertible term promissory notes in our IPO in Australia and simultaneous private placement of Chess Depository Interests (CDIs) to accredited investors in the United States. In connection with the IPO, all our existing shares of preferred stock were converted into common stock. 
 In July and August 2013, we raised approximately $52.5 million, net of expenses, in an offering of our CDIs to sophisticated, professional, and accredited investors in Australia, the United States, and certain other jurisdictions. In May 2014, we raised approximately $30.8 million, net of expenses, in an offering of our CDIs to sophisticated, professional, and accredited investors in Australia, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, and certain other jurisdictions. 
 In December 2016, we raised approximately $1.0 million, net of expenses, in an offering of our CDIs to sophisticated and professional investors in Australia and certain other jurisdictions. 
 In January 2017, we raised approximately $0.2 million, net of expenses, in an offering of our CDIs to eligible shareholders under a Security Purchase Plan (SPP) available to security holders with registered addresses in Australia or New Zealand. 
 In June 2017, we completed a Convertible Term Promissory Note (the “Note”) financing for a gross amount of $5.0 million that accrues interest at 5% per annum compounded annually. The Note is due by December 31, 2018 and contains provisions for conversion during the term of the Note.
 In February and March 2018, we raised approximately $1.6 million in an offering of our CDIs to sophisticated and professional investors, including certain existing investors, in Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom.    
 We will continue to seek additional capital to fund the company’s operations as the situation dictates. Future financing may take the form of a number of different options as the management team seeks the best solutions for our corporate needs, clinical support of EndoBarrier, and our shareholders. 
 We are headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, where the majority of the company’s employees work. We have employees and subsidiaries in the Netherlands, Germany, and Australia. 
 We signed an agreement with our manufacturing partner Proven Process Medical Devices (“PPMD”, “the Manufacturer”) as announced on July 26, 2017.  
 The rights of our shareholders are governed by Delaware general corporation law. We have five subsidiaries: GI Dynamics Securities Corporation, a Massachusetts-incorporated nontrading entity; GID Europe Holding B.V., a Netherlands-incorporated nontrading holding company; GID Europe B.V., a Netherlands-incorporated company that conducts certain of our European business operations; GID Germany GmbH, a German-incorporated company that conducts certain of our European business operations; and GI Dynamics Australia Pty Ltd, an Australia-incorporated company that conducts our Australian business operations.

We will need to raise additional capital in 2018. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had revenue of approximately $53 thousand, and our net loss was approximately $10.9 million. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2017, was approximately $259 million. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $3.03 million of cash and cash equivalents. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information regarding our funding requirements. 
 The company is operating at a loss and has no current revenue.  The company will need to raise capital in April 2018 in order to continue to operate as a going concern.
 
Market Opportunity 
 Unmet Clinical Needs in the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes and Obesity 
 The International Diabetes Federation (2015) estimates there are 415 million adults with diabetes worldwide, with ~90% diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, blindness, and lower-limb amputation in almost all countries. 
 Three years after initial diagnosis, over half of patients with type 2 diabetes require multiple drug therapies; studies show that less than 50% of the type 2 diabetes population is adequately managed pharmacologically. At ten years postdiagnosis, most patients, despite insulin use in many, struggle to reach their hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) treatment goals. HbA1c is a glycosylated hemoglobin molecule found in the bloodstream that is formed when red blood cells are exposed to blood glucose. HbA1c has become the generally accepted gold standard biomarker for measuring levels of diabetes control in clinical practice and in human trials. 
 Many patients and health care systems struggle to meet the financial burden imposed by the numerous concurrent medications required to attempt to control the progressive nature of type 2 diabetes. 
 According to the World Health Organization (2014), more than 1.9 billion adults 18 and older were overweight. Of these, 600 million people worldwide have obesity (BMI ³ 30 kg/m 2), a condition often leading to serious health consequences such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders, and some cancers. 
 Those suffering from both type 2 diabetes and obesity total more than 169 million worldwide, representing one of the largest health care market issues and opportunities in the world. We believe that the unchecked worldwide rate of growth of the type 2 diabetes and obesity patient population presents one of the greatest unmanaged health risks in all of health care. 
 We believe EndoBarrier can treat patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity in a safe, effective, nonpharmacological, and nonpermanent procedural manner. 
 The Treatment Gap 
 Our intent in developing, seeking regulatory approval, and marketing EndoBarrier is to help clinicians deliver a unique treatment option in a disease state that sorely lacks innovative new treatment options: the type 2 diabetes and obesity clinical space.

We and our scientific advisors feel there must be a change in how the medical establishment currently treats patients suffering from type 2 diabetes and obesity. We believe current treatment options fall short of treating the disease. The number of patients progressing to later stages of type 2 diabetes and obesity continues to grow at an alarming rate. Yet less than half of all type 2 diabetes patients are adequately managed by pharmacotherapy, and insulin carries serious risks and contributes to further progression of obesity. At the extreme end of the treatment spectrum, the treatment options are limited to different types of bariatric or metabolic surgery, which are highly invasive procedures. Less than 2% of patients who are eligible for bariatric or metabolic surgery opt to undergo the procedure. 
 

The graphic above illustrates the multiple treatment options along the course of progression of type 2 diabetes: 
  
• | Risk associated with treatment increases from left to right.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Progression of diabetes and obesity increases from left to right.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lifestyle, diet, and exercise are the first line of defense against the progression of type 2 diabetes and obesity.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pharmacotherapy
--+----------------


o | Oral monotherapy follows lifestyle intervention, often with metformin as the first line of treatment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Multiple combinations may then be administered, as recommended by the American Diabetes Association.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Ultimately, as disease progression continues, injected insulin may be prescribed.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Bariatric or metabolic gastric bypass surgery represents the final option.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A significant and rapidly growing patient population falls into the treatment gap, where the patient is inadequately managed by medication yet unwilling to undergo gastric bypass. This is where EndoBarrier fits within the treatment gap.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The type 2 diabetes and obesity treatment gap is widening at an alarming rate. 
 We believe that neither pharmacotherapy nor gastric bypass surgery adequately treat the disease for many patients. 
 More alarming is that for many patients who elect to undergo bariatric or metabolic surgery, the clinical gains are not permanent, but the exposure to risk associated with the procedure is. The fastest growing area of bariatric and metabolic surgery is revisional bariatric/metabolic intervention (RBMI) surgery, which carries an even higher rate of complications and risk. 
 We believe a solution is desperately needed to fill this treatment gap. 
 EndoBarrier Value Proposition 
 Our intent in developing EndoBarrier is to offer an adjunct to pharmacotherapy, a chance to significantly reduce or eliminate insulin for many patients and alternative to bariatric or metabolic surgery. 
 Obesity exacerbates insulin resistance and contributes to the progression of type 2 diabetes. In situations where lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy have failed and surgery is not an option or is considered a therapy of last resort, EndoBarrier is a proven solution intended to break the pathogenic relationship between type 2 diabetes and obesity. In clinical trials in both the United States and outside of the United States (OUS), EndoBarrier has been shown to: 
  
• | Significantly improve glucose levels
--+-------------------------------------


• | Significantly lower body weight
--+--------------------------------


• | Lower cardiovascular-related risks
--+-----------------------------------

 EndoBarrier accomplishes this by affecting key hormones involved in insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, satiety, and food intake. (See section “The EndoBarrier Mechanism of Action.”) 
 
11


Our intent in positioning EndoBarrier to fill the treatment gap is to help patients and clinicians avoid the initiation of insulin therapy by helping patients maintain lower HbA1c levels and slowing the progression of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, for those patients whose type 2 diabetes has progressed to the point where insulin therapy is necessary, we hope EndoBarrier will reduce HbA1c levels to the point where insulin is no longer needed. Finally, if the progression of type 2 diabetes is severe enough to warrant gastric bypass surgery, we hope that EndoBarrier may serve as an opportunity to control type 2 diabetes so that surgery may not be needed, or at least better prepare the patient for bariatric surgery by lowering weight and helping control other comorbidities prior to surgery. 
 
 
Our goal:

EndoBarrier Value Proposition: 
  
• | One solution — With EndoBarrier, patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity may control their glucose levels and weight with one procedure.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Incision-free procedure, does not alter anatomy — Brief, minimally invasive implantation and removal procedures that do not involve cutting of any tissue or permanent anatomical alterations that are far less invasive than bariatric or metabolic procedures and therefore may be more acceptable to patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduces and helps control HbA1c — Multiple studies have shown that EndoBarrier reduces HbA1c in a clinically meaningful manner.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduces and helps control body weight — Multiple studies have shown that EndoBarrier reduces weight in a clinically meaningful manner.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simple procedure — The procedure is minimally invasive and fully reversible, usually takes less than twenty minutes, and may be conducted under general anesthesia or conscious sedation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We and our Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) are dedicated to furthering the scientific and clinical understanding of EndoBarrier, associated mechanisms of action, and the target disease states. 
 How EndoBarrier Works: EndoBarrier Mechanism of Action 
 The EndoBarrier mechanism of action is widely accepted based on its functional similarities to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB). Clinical data suggest that once the EndoBarrier is implanted into the duodenum and proximal jejunum, ingested food passing through the EndoBarrier during the normal digestive process is prevented from interacting with the epithelium, microbiota, mucosal layer, or biliopancreatic secretions within the duodenum and proximal jejunum. The EndoBarrier acts as a physical barrier that prevents the interaction of food with pancreatic enzymes and bile. Pancreatic enzymes and bile pass outside EndoBarrier and mix with the food at the distal end of the liner, where absorption ultimately takes place in the intestine. Thus, EndoBarrier creates a functional but reversible bypass of the upper intestine. Unlike Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, EndoBarrier does not require an invasive and permanent surgical procedure or permanent physical modification of the stomach and exclusion of the distal stomach from the alimentary flow. 
 Our scientific team and advisors have postulated the following EndoBarrier mechanisms of action: 
  
• | Decreased caloric intake — Studies have demonstrated that patients with EndoBarrier, aided by increased satiety from GLP-1, eat less and feel full longer, leading to a decrease in caloric intake.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exclusion of the duodenum — This may offset an abnormality of gastrointestinal physiology responsible for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 12


 
• | Increased nutrient delivery to the distal small bowel — Additional findings suggest that the exclusion of the proximal intestine (foregut theory) and increase in nutrient delivery to the distal small bowel (hindgut theory) created by EndoBarrier likely induce neuro-hormonal changes and nutrient sensing that affect energy balance and glucose homeostasis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Secretion of GLP-1 — Partially digested nutrients reach the distal ileum, which stimulates the secretion of GLP-1 by L-cells located in this area. GLP-1 is known to regulate insulin secretion and action.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase in gut hormones — This contributes to the restoration of energy and glucose homeostasis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Elevated GLP-1 and PYY levels — Both levels are elevated as quickly as one week post-implantation. Both hormones may play a role in satiety and body weight control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased levels of bile acids — This stimulates thermogenesis and gut hormone secretions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improved islet function — Data suggest that pancreatic islet function is improved, affecting both insulin and glucagon secretion, positively affecting blood glucose levels. This shift to more favorable pancreatic islet function may be explained in part by the increase in the incretin hormone GLP-1 (as noted above) because this beneficial effect is well documented (i.e., a fundamental mechanism of both DPP4 inhibitor and GLP-1 receptor agonist pharmacologies).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Intestinal flora — EndoBarrier may positively alter intestinal flora.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 There is no known evidence of significant malabsorption of ingested calories with the EndoBarrier device. EndoBarrier covers only 60 cm of duodenal and proximal jejunal mucosa, which represents less than 15% of the length of the small intestine and leaves almost the entire jejunum and ileum for digestion and absorption. 
 2017 in Review 
 For us, 2017 was a year focused on stabilizing the Company and continuing to address operational issues, continuing to reduce cash burn, working with OUS regulatory bodies and working with the FDA with the intent of gaining approval for a new EndoBarrier pivotal clinical trial in the United States. 
 The company executed a contract with premier manufacturer, PPMD, of Mansfield, MA.
 The company continued to develop its intellectual property position.
 The company completed the development of a world-class Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) comprised of many of the world’s leaders in metabolic and bariatric interventions. 
 In November 2017, we received notification from SGS United Kingdom Limited (“SGS”), the Company’s notified body in Europe, that SGS was withdrawing the Certificate of Conformity for EndoBarrier.  The Certificate of Conformity is required for the sale of any product under CE marking. As a result, we are not permitted to supply the EndoBarrier device and retrieval device in Europe. 
 Independent investigator-initiated trials and two ongoing Registries continued to announce clinically significant data throughout the year.
 We believe EndoBarrier to be a safe and effective device that fills a growing treatment gap in a unique manner. 
 Strategic Focus in 2018: The Path Forward 
 Our current primary focus is on continued support for patients in Europe and the Middle East who have EndoBarrier devices currently implanted as of 2017 and before, and working with the FDA to secure approval for a pivotal clinical trial in the United States. We continue to work constructively with the FDA with the goal of obtaining agreement for a new study design for EndoBarrier. We continue to believe that there is a path forward that can be achieved for a new EndoBarrier study in the United States.  Further, we are firmly committed to continuing to develop EndoBarrier for the millions of patients suffering from type 2 diabetes and obesity and their clinicians. At least 30 presentations and 
 13


publications have released new EndoBarrier clinical data since the beginning of 2016.  The ABCD Worldwide EndoBarrier Registry now has close to 500 patients’ data entered.
 We are focused primarily on the following initiatives in 2018. 
  
• | Working with the FDA to secure agreement for a new pivotal clinical study design in the United States under IDE.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supporting clinicians and patients who have EndoBarrier currently implanted as of 2017 and before in Europe and the Middle East.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supporting ongoing independent investigator-initiated clinical trials and Registries.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Working with a new notified body in Europe with the goal of securing a new CE Mark.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continuing to reduce cost and operate in lean fashion.
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximizing shareholder value.
--+------------------------------

 
We will need to secure financing no later than April 2018 to continue operations. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of patents, together with nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect the proprietary rights to our technologies. Seedling Enterprises, LLC, initially conceived and developed our technology. In 2003, Seedling Enterprises, LLC, incorporated as GI Dynamics, Inc., and transferred all of its intellectual property relating to EndoBarrier to us with no further claims or royalties in exchange for shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, or common stock. 
 On December 31, 2017, our current patent portfolio was composed of 155 issued and pending US and non-US patents. We have been issued 43 US patents and maintain 17 pending US patent applications. We have also sought intellectual property protection outside the US and have been issued 72 patents across Australia, Canada, China, the European Patent Convention region (including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom), Hong Kong, and Japan, and we have 2 pending PCT applications and 21 pending foreign patent applications. We believe our patents and patent applications cover, but are not limited to, the following areas: 
  
• | The gastrointestinal liner and anchor;
--+---------------------------------------


• | Delivery and removal systems;
--+------------------------------


• | Placement of the device; and
--+-----------------------------


• | Treatment alternatives.
--+------------------------

 Our current issued patents expire between 2023 and 2031. We also actively monitor our intellectual property by regularly reviewing new developments to identify extensions to our patent portfolio. 
 We entered into a patent license agreement with Crabb Co., LLC, or Crabb, in 2003, which was amended in 2005, for the in-license of certain intellectual property related to the anchoring of an intestinal liner, which is anchored in the pylorus. This license was obtained early in our history, and though we are not currently using this intellectual property, it may be useful in future implant designs. The royalty obligation begins with US commercial sales of products covered by the Crabb intellectual property. The royalty percentage may vary on products covered by the license, but, in any case, the royalties are not considered significant. Our royalty obligations ceased upon the expiration of the license in 2017. 
 We employ external patent attorneys to assist us in managing our intellectual property portfolio. 
 In 2013, we settled litigation with the supplier of the liner material used to manufacture EndoBarrier, W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc., or Gore. Under the settlement, we retain exclusive ownership and control of our patent portfolio, and we and Gore have dismissed all claims against each other. We also granted Gore a nonexclusive, royalty-free license to use our patents, restricted to the vascular system. Gore is not licensed to use our patents for any applications in the gastrointestinal tract. Neither we nor Gore are required to make any cash payments to the other, nor will any royalties be due.
