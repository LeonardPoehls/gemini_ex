GREAT PLAINS ENERGY INCORPORATED
Great Plains Energy, a Missouri corporation incorporated in 2001 and headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, is a public utility holding company and does not own or operate any significant assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries and cash and cash equivalents and a time deposit to be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the anticipated acquisition of Westar Energy, Inc. (Westar). Great Plains Energy's wholly owned direct subsidiaries with significant operations are as follows:

• | KCP&L is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers primarily in the states of Missouri and Kansas. KCP&L has one active wholly owned subsidiary, Kansas City Power & Light Receivables Company (KCP&L Receivables Company). 


• | GMO is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the state of Missouri. GMO also provides regulated steam service to certain customers in the St. Joseph, Missouri area. GMO has two active wholly owned subsidiaries, GMO Receivables Company and MPS Merchant Services, Inc. (MPS Merchant). MPS Merchant has certain long-term natural gas contracts remaining from its former non-regulated trading operations. 

Great Plains Energy also wholly owns GPE Transmission Holding Company, LLC (GPETHC). GPETHC owns 13.5% of Transource Energy, LLC (Transource) with the remaining 86.5% owned by AEP Transmission Holding Company, LLC (AEPTHC), a subsidiary of American Electric Power Company, Inc. GPETHC accounts for its investment in Transource under the equity method. Transource is focused on the development of competitive electric transmission projects.
On May 29, 2016, Great Plains Energy entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) by and among Great Plains Energy, Westar, and, from and after its accession to the Merger Agreement, GP Star, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy in the State of Kansas (Merger Sub). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into Westar, with Westar continuing as the surviving corporation. Upon closing, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Great Plains Energy will acquire Westar for (i) $51.00 in cash and (ii) a number, rounded to the nearest 1/10,000 of a share, of shares of Great Plains Energy common stock, equal to an exchange ratio that may vary between 0.2709 and 0.3148, based upon the volume-weighted average price per share of Great Plains Energy common stock during a 20 consecutive full trading day period ending on (and including) the third trading day immediately prior to the closing date of the merger, for each share of Westar common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, with Westar becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the anticipated acquisition of Westar.
Great Plains Energy's sole reportable business segment is electric utility. For information regarding the revenues, income and assets attributable to the electric utility business segment, see Note 23 to the consolidated financial 
7


statements. Comparative financial information and discussion regarding the electric utility business segment can be found in Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A).
The electric utility segment consists of KCP&L, a regulated utility, GMO's regulated utility operations and GMO Receivables Company. Electric utility serves approximately 855,700 customers located in western Missouri and eastern Kansas. Customers include approximately 753,500 residences, 99,700 commercial firms and 2,500 industrials, municipalities and other electric utilities. Electric utility's retail revenues averaged approximately 91% of its total operating revenues over the last three years. Wholesale firm power, bulk power sales and miscellaneous electric revenues accounted for the remainder of electric utility's revenues. Electric utility is significantly impacted by seasonality with approximately one-third of its retail revenues recorded in the third quarter. Electric utility's total electric revenues were 100% of Great Plains Energy's revenues over the last three years. Electric utility's net income accounted for approximately 101%, 105% and 100% of Great Plains Energy's net income in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Regulation
KCP&L and GMO are regulated by the Public Service Commission of the State of Missouri (MPSC) and KCP&L is also regulated by The State Corporation Commission of the State of Kansas (KCC) with respect to retail rates, certain accounting matters, standards of service and, in certain cases, the issuance of securities, certification of facilities and service territories. KCP&L and GMO are also subject to regulation by The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) with respect to transmission, wholesale sales and rates, and other matters. KCP&L has a 47% ownership interest in Wolf Creek Generating Station (Wolf Creek), which is subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) with respect to licensing, operations and safety-related requirements. 
The table below summarizes the rate orders in effect for KCP&L's and GMO's retail rate jurisdictions.

 | Regulator | Allowed Return on Equity | Rate-Making Equity Ratio | Rate Base (in billions) | Effective Date
KCP&L Missouri | MPSC | 9.5% | 50.09% | $2.6 | September 2015
KCP&L Kansas | KCC | 9.3% | 50.48% | $2.1 | October 2015 
GMO | MPSC | 9.5% - 9.75%(a) | (a) | (a) | February 2017 

(a) GMO's current rate order reflects a global settlement with an implied return on equity range of 9.5% - 9.75% and does not contain an agreed upon rate-making equity ratio or rate base.
Missouri and Kansas jurisdictional retail revenues averaged approximately 70% and 30%, respectively, of electric utility's total retail revenues over the last three years.
See Item 7 MD&A, Critical Accounting Policies section, and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning regulatory matters.
Competition 
Missouri and Kansas continue on the fully integrated retail utility model. As a result, electric utility does not compete with others to supply and deliver electricity in its franchised service territory, although other sources of energy can provide alternatives to retail electric utility customers. If Missouri or Kansas were to pass and implement legislation authorizing or mandating retail choice, electric utility may no longer be able to apply regulated utility accounting principles to deregulated portions of its operations and may be required to write off certain regulatory assets and liabilities. 
Electric utility competes in the wholesale market to sell power in circumstances when the power it generates is not required for customers in its service territory. This competition primarily occurs within the SPP Integrated Marketplace, in which KCP&L and GMO are participants. Similar to other Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) or Independent System Operator (ISO) markets currently operating, this marketplace determines which generating units among market participants should run, within the operating constraints of a unit, at any given time for maximum cost-effectiveness. 
8


In this regard, electric utility competes with owners of other generating stations and other power suppliers, principally other utilities within the Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (SPP) Integrated Marketplace, on the basis of availability and price. Electric utility's wholesale revenues averaged approximately 7% of its total revenues over the last three years.
Power Supply
Electric utility has approximately 6,500 MWs of owned generating capacity and also purchases power to meet its customers' needs, to satisfy firm power commitments or to meet renewable energy standards. Electric utility's purchased power from others, as a percentage of MWh requirements, averaged approximately 24% over the last three years. Management believes electric utility will be able to obtain enough power to meet its future demands due to the coordination of planning and operations in the SPP region and existing power purchase agreements; however, price and availability of power purchases may be impacted during periods of high demand. 
Electric utility's total capacity by fuel type, including both owned generating capacity and power purchase agreements, is detailed in the table below.

Fuel Type | Estimated 2017 MW Capacity | Percent of Total Capacity
Coal | 3,474 | | 46 | %
Nuclear | 549 | | 7 | 
Natural gas and oil | 2,352 | | 31 | 
Wind (a) | 1,089 | | 15 | 
Solar and hydroelectric (b) | 65 | | 1 | 
Total capacity | 7,529 | | 100 | %

(a) MWs are based on nameplate capacity of the wind facility. Includes owned generating capacity of 149 MWs and long-term power purchase agreements of approximately 940 MWs of wind generation which expire in 2032 through 2037. Power purchase agreements for approximately 300 MWs of wind generation to begin in late 2017 and expire in 2037 are not included in the table above.
(b) Includes a long-term power purchase agreement for approximately 60 MWs of hydroelectric generation which expires in 2023.
Electric utility's projected peak summer demand for 2017 is approximately 5,800 MWs. Electric utility expects to meet its projected capacity requirements for the foreseeable future with its generation assets and power and capacity purchases. 
KCP&L and GMO are members of the SPP. The SPP is an RTO mandated by FERC to ensure reliable supply of power, adequate transmission infrastructure and competitive wholesale prices of electricity. As members of the SPP, KCP&L and GMO are required to maintain a capacity margin of at least 12%. This net positive supply of capacity and energy is maintained through their generation assets, capacity agreements, power purchase agreements and peak demand reduction programs. The capacity margin is designed to ensure the reliability of electric energy in the SPP region in the event of operational failure of power generating units utilized by the members of the SPP.

Fuel
The principal fuel sources for electric utility's owned generation are coal and nuclear fuel. It is expected, with normal weather, that approximately 97% of 2017 owned generation will come from these sources with the remainder provided by wind, natural gas and oil. The actual 2016 and estimated 2017 fuel mix and delivered cost in cents per net kilowatt hour (kWh) generated are outlined in the following table. 

 | | | | | Fuel cost in cents per
 | Fuel Mix (a) | net kWh generated
 | Estimated | Actual | Estimated | Actual
Fuel | 2017 | 2016 | | 2017 | | 2016
Coal | 76 | % | 79 | % | | | 1.79 | 1.84 
Nuclear | 21 | | 17 | | | | 0.64 | 0.69 
Natural gas and oil | <1 | | 2 | | | | 7.30 | 13.65
Wind | 3 | | 2 | | | | — | — 
Total owned generation | 100 | % | 100 | % | | | 1.45 | 1.46 
(a) Fuel mix based on percent of net MWhs generated.

Coal
During 2017, electric utility's generating units, including jointly owned units, are projected to burn approximately 12 million tons of coal. KCP&L and GMO have entered into coal-purchase contracts with various suppliers in Wyoming's Powder River Basin (PRB), the nation's principal supply region of low-sulfur coal, and with local suppliers. The coal to be provided under these contracts is expected to satisfy approximately 100% of the projected coal requirements for 2017 and approximately 48% for 2018. The remainder of the coal requirements is expected to be fulfilled through additional contracts or spot market purchases. KCP&L and GMO have entered into coal contracts over time at higher average prices affecting coal costs for 2017 and beyond.
KCP&L and GMO have also entered into rail transportation contracts with various railroads to transport coal from the PRB to their generating units. The transportation services to be provided under these contracts are expected to satisfy almost all of the projected transportation requirements for 2017 and approximately 39% for 2018. The contract rates adjust for changes in railroad costs. 
Nuclear Fuel
KCP&L owns 47% of Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation (WCNOC), the operating company for Wolf Creek, which is electric utility's only nuclear generating unit. Wolf Creek purchases uranium and has it processed for use as fuel in its reactor. This process involves conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride, enrichment of uranium hexafluoride and fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies. The owners of Wolf Creek have on hand or under contract all of the uranium and conversion services needed to operate Wolf Creek through March 2027. The owners also have under contract 97% of the uranium enrichment and all of the fabrication required to operate Wolf Creek through March 2027 and September 2025, respectively. 
See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding nuclear plant.
