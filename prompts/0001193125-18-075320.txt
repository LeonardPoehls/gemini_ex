Tucatinib 
 Our lead development candidate, tucatinib, is an investigational orally bioavailable, potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that is highly selective for HER2, also known as ErbB2, a growth factor receptor that is over-expressed in approximately 20% of breast cancers. In addition to breast cancer, HER2 is over-expressed in other malignancies, including subsets of bladder, cervical, colorectal, esophageal, gastric, lung and ovarian cancers. We are currently developing tucatinib for the treatment of HER2-positive (HER2+) metastatic breast cancer. Over-expression of HER2 in breast cancer has been associated historically with increased mortality in early stage disease, decreased time to relapse and increased incidence of metastases. Similarly, the overexpression of HER2 is thought to play an important role in the development and progression of other cancers. 
 The introduction of HER2-targeted therapies, including antibody-based therapies and small molecule TKIs, has led to improvement in the outcomes of patients with HER2+ cancer. Unlike pan-HER TKIs, tucatinib selectively inhibits HER2 and is at least 1,000-fold more selective for HER2 than the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This selectivity may improve drug tolerability by reducing the risk of severe diarrhea and skin rash commonly seen with pan-HER TKIs. 
 We are currently conducting a randomized (2:1), double-blind, controlled pivotal clinical trial, known as HER2CLIMB, comparing tucatinib versus placebo, each in combination with capecitabine (Xeloda®) and trastuzumab (Herceptin®), and without loperamide or budesonide prophylaxis, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer who have had prior treatment with a taxane, trastuzumab, pertuzumab (Perjeta®) and ado-trastuzumab emtansine or T-DM1 (Kadcyla®) and who may or may not have brain metastases. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) based upon independent radiologic review. Patients will also be followed for overall survival, which is a secondary endpoint. Key objectives related to assessing activity in brain metastases include a secondary endpoint of PFS in a subset of patients with brain metastases. HER2CLIMB is currently enrolling patients in the United States, Canada, Western Europe and Australia and is expected to expand into Israel early in 2018. The HER2CLIMB clinical trial is intended to support a potential new drug application (NDA) submission to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a potential Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). 
 In addition, our two Phase 1b trials of tucatinib, one in combination with T-DM1 and another in combination with capecitabine and/or trastuzumab, are fully enrolled and active patients remain on treatment. Results to date from the Phase 1b trials indicate these drug combinations are well tolerated and may provide clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer, with and without brain metastases. 
 Updated results from the Phase 1b triplet combination study (tucatinib with capecitabine and trastuzumab) showed that the combination continued to be well tolerated. Compared to previously reported interim results, the updated PFS increased to 7.8 months and the overall response rate (ORR) increased to 61%. The median duration of response was 10 months. Patients in the Phase 1b triplet combination trial previously received a median of three HER2-targeted agents such as trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib or T-DM1. These updated results were presented at the 2016 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS). 
 In September 2017, results from the pooled analysis of Phase 1b combination studies showed further support for the potential utility of tucatinib for patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer with brain metastases, including untreated or progressive brain metastases after radiation therapy. In addition, data from nonclinical models were presented that support the evaluation of tucatinib in HER2+ gastrointestinal cancers. These results were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2017 Congress. 
 In December 2017, we reported results from a subgroup analysis from its two ongoing combination studies of tucatinib, which demonstrated prolonged progression-free survival benefit regardless of presence of brain metastases or patient characteristics. These results were presented at the 2017 SABCS. 
 In July 2017, we announced that the EMA confirmed that positive results from HER2CLIMB could serve as a single registrational trial for submission of a MAA to the EMA for potential marketing approval. We had received similar confirmation from the FDA in 2016. 
 In September 2017, we announced tucatinib was granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of HER2+ colorectal cancer and, in June 2017, we announced that tucatinib was granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of breast cancer patients with brain metastases.

In June 2016, tucatinib was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic HER2+ breast cancer. The FDAs Fast Track process is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. 
 Tucatinib is also being evaluated in investigator-initiated studies in combination with approved agents. In June 2017, a Phase 2 study called MOUNTAINEER was initiated to evaluate tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab for patients with HER2 amplified metastatic colorectal cancer and recently began enrolling participants in the U.S. 
 In December 2017, the first patient was enrolled in the investigator-initiated Phase 1b/2 trial that is evaluating tucatinib in combination with an aromatase inhibitor and CDK4/6 agent for patients with hormone receptor-positive and HER2-positive (HR+/HER2+) metastatic breast cancer. 
 We have an exclusive license agreement with Array BioPharma Inc. for the worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize tucatinib. 
 Other Pipeline Candidates 
 Although our efforts are focused primarily on developing and commercializing tucatinib, we have two preclinical programs. Our earlier stage product candidates are CASC-578, a Chk1 cell cycle inhibitor that is an orally available, small molecule kinase inhibitor, and CASC-674, an antibody against an immuno-oncology target known as TIGIT. 
 Chk1 is a protein kinase that regulates the cell division cycle and is activated in response to DNA damage and DNA replication stress. Cancer cells often have mutations that alter DNA damage response signaling pathways that function in parallel with Chk1 to regulate the cell cycle. These mutations may make tumor cells more reliant on the activity of Chk1 to provide cell cycle checkpoint control, which represents a potential weak point that can be exploited by drugs that target Chk1. 
 TIGIT (T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITM domains) is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T-cells and NK cells that may negatively regulate immune response to cancers. Antibodies that inhibit TIGIT function may potentially activate anti-tumor immune responses. 
 The continued research and development of our product candidates will require significant additional expenditures, including preclinical studies, clinical trials, manufacturing costs and the expenses of seeking regulatory approval. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our strategy is focused on the development of therapeutic products for the treatment of cancer. The key elements of our strategy are to: 
 

 | Develop tucatinib in HER2+ metastatic breast cancer. We intend to develop and commercialize tucatinib for adult patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer, including patients with or without brain metastases.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expand tucatinib development in other tumor types. We believe tucatinib has potential in other tumor types and intend to continue to evaluate tucatinib in other solid tumors, including HER2+ colorectal cancer, through ongoing and planned investigator-initiated studies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Support our internal activities with strategic collaborations and out-licensing. We may enter into collaborations, acquisitions or license arrangements to advance the development or potential commercialization of programs in our pipeline. Such relationships can supplement our own internal expertise in areas such as clinical trials, and manufacturing, as well as provide us with access to licensees marketing, sales and distribution capabilities.

Oncology Market Overview and Opportunity 
 Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women worldwide, and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women in North America. The American Cancer Society estimated that in 2017 more than 250,000 women in the U.S. would develop breast cancer and more than 40,000 would die from the disease. Approximately 15-20% of breast cancers overexpress HER2. 
 The treatment of breast cancer differs by stage and includes surgery and radiation for most patients with early-stage disease. The addition of HER2 targeted agents, including antibody-based therapies and a small molecule, has led to significant improvements in progression-free survival and overall survival, both in the adjuvant setting and for patients with metastatic HER2+ disease. There are currently four approved agents for the treatment of HER2+ metastatic breast cancer, trastuzumab, pertuzumab, TDM1 and lapatinib. 
 The prevention and treatment of metastatic disease in the central nervous system (CNS), including brain metastases, remains a significant unmet medical need for patients with HER2+ breast cancer. The incidence of first relapse occurring in the brain is increasing in patients who have progressed following trastuzumab-containing adjuvant regimens, and approximately 30-50% of patients with HER2+ metastatic disease will develop brain metastases over the course of their disease. 
 Development Candidates 
 Tucatinib 
 Our lead development candidate, tucatinib, is an orally bioavailable, potent TKI that is highly selective for HER2, also known as ErbB2, a growth factor receptor that is over-expressed in approximately 20% of breast cancers. In addition to breast cancer, HER2 is overexpressed in other malignancies, including subsets of bladder, cervical, colorectal, esophageal, gastric, lung and ovarian cancers. We are currently developing tucatinib for the treatment of HER2+ metastatic breast cancer. Over-expression of HER2 in breast cancer has been associated historically with increased mortality in early stage disease, decreased time to relapse and increased incidence of metastases. The introduction of HER2-targeted therapies, including antibody-based therapies and the small molecule TKI, lapatinib, has led to improvement in the outcomes of patients with HER2+ cancer. Unlike lapatinib, tucatinib selectively inhibits HER2 and is at least 1,000-fold more selective for HER2 than EGFR. This selectivity may improve drug tolerability by reducing Grade 3 (severe) diarrhea and skin rash. We acquired tucatinib in December 2014 pursuant to an agreement under which we have certain royalty and milestone payment obligations. See Part I, Item 1, BusinessLicense Agreements for additional information. 
 Tucatinib has been studied as a single agent in a Phase 1 clinical trial, with both dose-escalation and cohort expansion components, which enrolled 50 patients, 43 of whom had HER2+ metastatic breast cancer. All HER2+ breast cancer patients had progressed on a trastuzumab-containing regimen that may have also included other chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, over 80% had been treated with lapatinib, with many patients having progressed on this therapy. In this study, tucatinib demonstrated an acceptable safety profile; treatment-related adverse events were primarily Grade 1. Because tucatinib is selective for HER2 and does not inhibit the EGFR, there was a low incidence and severity of treatment-related diarrhea, rash and fatigue which may be associated with tucatinibs high selectively for HER2 over EGFR. Additionally, there were no treatment-related cardiac events or Grade 4 treatment-related adverse events reported. Twenty-two HER2+ breast cancer patients with measurable disease were treated with tucatinib at doses greater than or equal to 600 mg BID. In this heavily pretreated patient population, there was a clinical benefit rate of 27% (partial response [n = 3] plus stable disease for at least 6 months [n = 3]). 
 In February 2014, we initiated two Phase 1b trials of tucatinib. The trials are closed to enrollment although patients remain on treatment. The following is a summary of these studies: 
 Phase 1b Clinical Trial of tucatinib in combination with TDM-1:
This Phase 1b clinical trial studied tucatinib in combination with T-DM1 in patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer who had progressed following prior treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane. This trial was a dose-escalation study of tucatinib in combination with the approved dose of T-DM1, with expansion cohorts in patients with and without brain metastases. The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose/[define RP2D] (MTD/RP2D) of tucatinib in combination with the approved dose of T-DM1. Secondary objectives included an evaluation of the safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of the combination.

As reported at the 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting, patients treated at the MTD of tucatinib with T-DM1 had previously been treated with trastuzumab, and, in addition, 46% had been treated with prior pertuzumab, and 20% with prior lapatinib. Overall,60% of patients had a history of brain metastases and 42% had brain metastases that were either untreated or had progressed after prior local treatment. In this high-risk population, durable (> 6 months) systemic and CNS responses as well as disease stabilization were seen. The ORR was 41% (14/34) in patients with measurable disease and at least one follow-up scan, and the CNS response rate was 33% (4/12). 
 The combination of tucatinib and T-DM1 was clinically well tolerated. In 50 patients treated at the MTD of tucatinib, the majority of adverse events were low grade in severity, Grade 1 or 2, and included nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, thrombocytopenia and asymptomatic elevated liver enzymes. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in only two patients (4%), with no mandatory use of anti-diarrheal medications. While asymptomatic elevations in ALT/AST were seen in most patients, the majority were Grade 1 or 2 in severity requiring no change in dosing. Asymptomatic Grade 3 elevations were reported in 18% of patients (9/50) and Grade 4 elevation in 2% (1/50). Except in the setting of progressive liver metastases, all Grade 3 or greater elevations of ALT/AST were reversible with dose interruption and dose reduction of tucatinib and T-DM1. Two of 50 patients (4%), experienced asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction, reported as Grade 1 heart failure. Both of these patients had a prior history of treatment with trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Treatment with both tucatinib and T-DM1 was discontinued in one of these patients, and treatment with T-DM1 alone was discontinued in a second patient who went on to recover normal cardiac function. 
 Phase 1b Clinical Trial of tucatinib in combination with capecitabine and/or trastuzumab: 
 In December 2015, updated results from the Phase 1b clinical trial of tucatinib evaluating tucatinib in combination with capecitabine and/or trastuzumab in patients previously treated with trastuzumab and TDM-1 for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer were presented at the 2015 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Some patients had also been previously treated with pertuzumab or lapatinib. The primary objective of this study was to determine the maximum-tolerated and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of tucatinib in combination with the approved dose of either capecitabine or trastuzumab, or both. Secondary objectives included an evaluation of the safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of the combinations. The trial included expansion cohorts at the MTD/RP2D of tucatinib in combination with both capecitabine and trastuzumab and with trastuzumab or capecitabine alone in patients with and without brain metastases. 
 In a heavily pretreated population, durable (> 6 months) systemic and CNS responses as well as disease stabilization were seen across all three treatment combinations, including patients previously treated with pertuzumab and/or lapatinib as well as trastuzumab and T-DM1. As reported at SABCS in 2015, in seven patients treated with tucatinib and capecitabine, the ORR was 83%, with a CNS response in the one patient with assessable brain metastases and at least one follow-up scan. In 16 patients treated with tucatinib and trastuzumab, the ORR was 29%, with a CNS response in one of seven patients with assessable brain metastases and at least one follow-up scan. In 18 patients treated with tucatinib and capecitabine and trastuzumab, the ORR was 39%, with CNS response in two of four patients with assessable brain metastases and at least one follow-up scan. 
 In June 2016, updated data from our Phase 1b clinical trial combining tucatinib with trastuzumab and capecitabine were presented at our R&D Day held in New York. In this combination trial, the majority of adverse events were Grade 1, with most patients being able to continue on the full dose of tucatinib. Grade 3 diarrhea was infrequent without a requirement for prophylactic anti-diarrheal medicine. The ORR was 58% and the interim PFS was 6.3 months, with many patients still active on study at the time of the data analysis. Outcomes in patients with brain metastases were similar to patients without brain metastases. In October 2016, data from our on-going combination trial of tucatinib with trastuzumab and capecitabine demonstrating clinical activity in HER2+ metastatic lesions to the skin was presented at the 2016 European Society of Clinical Oncology meeting. 
 In December 2016, updated data from the Phase 1b trial showed encouraging safety and anti-tumor activity in patients with and without brain metastases, with an updated median PFS of 7.8 months (a 24% improvement over prior median PFS), ORR of 61% and a median duration of response of 10 months. Patients with and without brain metastases had similar response rates. The combination of tucatinib with trastuzumab and capecitabine was well-tolerated. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were Grade 1, with few tucatinib dose reductions and no required prophylactic use of antidiarrheal agents. These updated data were presented at the 2016 SABCS meeting.

In December 2016, we reported that following a meeting with the FDA and discussions with our external Steering Committee, we had amended the ongoing HER2CLIMB Phase 2 clinical trial of tucatinib by increasing the sample size so that, if successful, the trial could serve as a single pivotal study to support registration. HER2CLIMB is a randomized (2:1), double-blind, controlled pivotal clinical trial comparing tucatinib vs. placebo in combination with capecitabine and trastuzumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have had prior treatment with a taxane, trastuzumab, pertuzumab and T-DM1.The primary endpoint remains PFS based upon independent radiologic review, and the sample size has increased to approximately 480 patients, including patients already enrolled in the trial. Key objectives related to assessing activity in brain metastases include a key secondary endpoint of PFS in a subset of patients with brain metastases. All patients will be followed for overall survival. 
 Preclinical Programs 
 Checkpoint kinase 1 inhibitor 
 Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) is a protein kinase that is activated in response to DNA damage and DNA replication stress. Together with other cellular factors, Chk1 provides a coordinated checkpoint to arrest the cell division cycle in response to damaged DNA. The induction of this cell cycle checkpoint enables cells to repair DNA lesions and ensures the fidelity of the cell division process. Cancer cells commonly have mutations that reduce or eliminate the activity of DNA damage response factors that function in parallel with Chk1. These mutations make tumor cells more reliant on the activity of Chk1 to provide cell cycle checkpoint control, which may make them more sensitive to Chk1 inhibitors and produce a synergistic tumor killing effect when combined with DNA targeted chemotherapy drugs. 
 We have identified a lead development candidate, CASC-578, which is an orally available, highly potent and selective Chk1 inhibitor. CASC-578 was developed in collaboration with Sentinel Oncology Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom. See Part I, Item 1, BusinessCollaborations for additional information. 
 Immuno-oncology 
 We have identified novel antibodies to TIGIT, an immune receptor that may block the induction of adaptive and innate immune response to cancers. The TIGIT antibody program is in preclinical development and is part of the collaborative effort with Adimab for the discovery of novel antibodies against immunotherapy targets. See Part I, Item 1, BusinessCollaborations for additional information. 
License and Collaboration Agreements 
 Array BioPharma Inc. In December 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Array. Pursuant to the license agreement, Array has granted us an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize tucatinib. The license agreement replaced a development and commercialization agreement under which we and Array were previously jointly developing tucatinib. As part of the agreement, we paid Array $20 million as an upfront fee. In addition, we will pay Array a portion of any payments received from sublicensing tucatinib rights. Array is also entitled to receive up to a low double-digit royalty based on net sales of tucatinib by us and a single-digit royalty based on net sales of tucatinib by our sublicensees. The term of the license agreement expires on a country-by-country basis upon the later of the expiration of the last valid claim covering tucatinib within that country or 10 years after the first commercial sale of tucatinib within that country. 
 Sentinel Oncology Ltd. In 2014, we entered into a research collaboration agreement with Sentinel for the discovery of novel Chk1 inhibitors. Under the agreement, we made payments to Sentinel to support their chemistry research. We are responsible for preclinical and clinical development, manufacture and commercialization of any resulting compounds. Sentinel is eligible to receive success-based development and commercial milestone payments up to approximately $90 million based on development and commercialization events, including the initiation of toxicology studies under the FDAs good laboratory practices (GLP) regulations, the initiation of certain clinical trials, regulatory approval and first commercial sale. Sentinel is also entitled to a single-digit royalty based on net sales. 
 Adimab LLC. In 2014, we initiated a collaboration with Adimab for the discovery of novel antibodies against immunotherapy targets in oncology. We have sole responsibility for the manufacture, development and commercialization of any antibody product candidates that result from the collaboration. The collaboration is currently at an early preclinical development stage. Adimab is entitled to certain research funding, success-based development milestone payments of up to $17 million and a low single-digit royalty based on net sales.

Patents and Proprietary Information 
 Our objective is to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property protection for our pipeline candidates and other proprietary technologies; to preserve our trade secrets; and to operate without infringing on the valid proprietary rights of other parties. We believe the protection of patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights that we own or license is critical to our success and competitive position. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, confidentiality agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights. 
 With respect to our development candidates, as of December 31, 2017, we owned three U.S. patent and 20 patent applications in other jurisdictions. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we had licensed approximately 182 issued patents and 81 patent applications from third parties, mostly on an exclusive basis. The patent portfolios for our leading product candidates as of December 31, 2017 are summarized below. 
 Tucatinib. In the United States, the composition of matter for tucatinib is covered by U.S. Patent No. 8,648,087, entitled N4-phenyl-quinazoline-4-amine derivatives and related compounds as ErbB type I receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases, which will provide patent coverage for tucatinib until 2031. We have also licensed U.S. Patent No. 9,693,989, with the same title. Patent applications corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 8,648,087 have issued in Australia, Canada, China, Columbia, Europe, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Ukraine and South Africa. Corresponding patent applications are pending in Brazil, Egypt, India, Israel, Norway and Russia. These foreign patents and patent applications, if issued, are not due to expire until at least 2026. The Array patent portfolio also includes other issued patents and pending patent applications drawn to tucatinib formulations, polymorphs and methods of use in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. 
 The patents and patent applications covered by the Array License Agreement are prosecuted by Array and reviewed and monitored by outside legal counsel on behalf of the Company. 
 CASC-578. CASC-578, a Chk1 kinase inhibitor, is licensed from Sentinel. The Sentinel Chk1 kinase inhibitor patent portfolio includes two issued U.S. patents, U.S. Patent No. 8,716,287, entitled Pharmaceutical compounds, and U.S. Patent No. 9,630,931, entitled Pharmaceutically active pyrazine derivatives, and a U.S. patent application, all of which are drawn to compounds and compositions that inhibit Chk-1 kinase activity. A foreign patent application also drawn to compounds and compositions that inhibit Chk-1 kinase activity has issued in Europe. The current U.S. issued patents and patent application, if issued, are not due to expire until at least 2031. The European patent is not due to expire until at least 2032. 
 The CASC-578 patent portfolio includes a pending U.S. patent application covering substituted pyrazoles, many of which have Chk1 inhibitor activity. Related foreign patent applications are pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Ukraine and South Africa. The currently pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, if issued, are not due to expire until at least 2035. Certain jurisdictions may provide mechanisms for restoring a period of patent term consumed by regulatory review. We will take advantage of all opportunities to extend the patent term in each jurisdiction where we are able to do so. 
 CASC-674. CASC-674, an antibody program against an immuno-oncology target known as TIGIT, was obtained from Adimab LLC. We are collaborating with Adimab for the discovery of novel antibodies against TIGIT. As of December 31, 2017, we have one patent application directed to TIGIT. 
 Certain jurisdictions, including the U.S., Japan and Europe, provide mechanisms for restoring a period of patent term consumed by regulatory review. We plan to take advantage of all opportunities to extend the patent term in each jurisdiction where we are able to do so. 
 Manufacturing 
 We use third party contractors to procure the necessary materials and manufacture, as applicable, starting materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug product, as well as for labeling, packaging, storage and distribution of our compounds. This arrangement allows us to use contract manufacturers that have extensive Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, manufacturing experience. We have a staff with experience in the management of contract manufacturing and in the development of efficient commercial manufacturing processes for our products candidates. We currently intend to outsource the manufacture of all our commercial products. 
 We believe that our existing supplies of tucatinib, along with our contract manufacturing relationships with our existing contract manufacturers, will be sufficient to supply tucatinib for HER2CLIMB and other clinical trials of tucatinib and to supply initial commercial quantities of tucatinib for commercial sale. As our business expands, we expect that our manufacturing, distribution and related operational requirements will increase correspondingly, and we may need to retain additional contractors to ensure adequate supplies of our products. Each third-party contractor undergoes a formal qualification process by our subject matter experts before services by that contractor commence, and each contractor is audited periodically thereafter as required by cGMP.

Competition 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive, and any product candidate developed by us will compete with existing drugs and therapies. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies and research organizations that compete with us in developing various approaches to cancer therapy. Many of these organizations have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have. Several of them have developed or are developing therapies that could be used for treatment of the same diseases that we are targeting. In addition, many of these competitors have significant commercial infrastructures that we do not currently have. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to: 

 | design and develop products that are superior to other products in the market and under development;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | attract and retain qualified scientific, product development, manufacturing and commercial personnel;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | obtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for our product candidates and technologies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | obtain required regulatory approvals;
--+--------------------------------------


 | successfully collaborate with pharmaceutical companies in the design, development and commercialization of new products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | compete on, among other things, product efficacy and safety profile, time to market, price, and the types of and convenience of treatment procedures; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | identify, secure the rights to and develop products and exploit these products commercially before others are able to develop competitive products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our ability to compete may be affected by government policies relating to the pricing and reimbursement of proprietary drug products and the policies of insurers and other third-party payors encouraging the use of generic products, all of which may make branded products less attractive to buyers from a cost perspective. 
 Tucatinib. Tucatinib is an inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinase HER2, also known as ErbB2. Multiple marketed products target HER2, including the antibodies trastuzumab (Herceptin®) and pertuzumab (Perjeta®) and the antibody toxin conjugate ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla®), all from Roche/Genentech. In addition, GlaxoSmithKline markets the dual HER1/HER2 oral kinase inhibitor lapatinib (Tykerb®) for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, Puma Biotechnology is developing the HER1/HER2/HER4 inhibitor neratinib in Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and government authorities in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of biopharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. In many other countries, governmental authorities also regulate reimbursement for products such as those we are developing. 
U.S. Government Regulation 
 In the United States, the information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain approval to market a new drug varies depending on whether the drug is a new product whose safety and effectiveness has not previously been demonstrated in humans or a drug whose active ingredient(s) and certain other properties are the same as those of a previously approved drug. A new drug will follow the New Drug Application (NDA) route for approval, a new biologic will follow the biologics license application (BLA) route for approval, and a drug that claims to be the same as an already approved drug may be able to follow the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) route for approval. Our tucatinib product candidate will follow the NDA route for approval. 
 NDA and BLA Approval Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologics under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and, in the case of biologics, also under the Public Health Service Act, and implementing regulations. If we fail to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDAs refusal to approve

 pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 The steps required before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States include: 
 

 | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies under the FDAs GLP regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;
--+----------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
--+-------------------------------------------

 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. Submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each clinical protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Each trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board for each site where the trial will be conducted before it can begin at that site. Phase 1 clinical trials usually involve the initial introduction of the investigational drug into humans to evaluate the product candidates safety, dosage tolerance, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve controlled trials in a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific indications. Phase 3 clinical trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded patient population. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or we may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and of the clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the chemistry, manufacture and control criteria of the product candidate, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, pure and potent and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the products continued safety, purity and potency. 
 Before approving an NDA or BLA application, the FDA may inspect the facility or the facilities at which the product candidate will be manufactured for commercial sale. The FDA will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA will also inspect a certain number of clinical sites that participated in clinical studies of the product candidate that is the subject of the application, as well as inspect the sponsor of the clinical trial to ensure processes and procedures used during the conduct of the trial were appropriate and comply with federal regulations. Any deficiencies at these clinical sites or by the sponsor could jeopardize approval of the NDA or BLA. If the FDA determines the application, results of inspections, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.

The testing and approval process for each NDA or BLA application requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure FDA approval, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our product candidates. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of our product candidates. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 Fast Track Designation / Priority Review 
 A Fast Track product is defined as a new drug or biologic intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition that demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request that the FDA designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the development of the product prior to marketing. 
 The FDA can base approval of an NDA or BLA application for a Fast Track product on the effect of the product candidate on a surrogate endpoint or on another endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may condition approval of an application for a Fast Track product candidate on a commitment to do post-approval clinical trials to validate the surrogate endpoint or confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint and may require prior review of all promotional materials. In addition, the FDA may withdraw approval of a Fast Track product in an expedited manner on a number of grounds, including the sponsors failure to conduct any required post-approval clinical trial in a timely manner. 
 The FDA also has established priority and standard review classifications for original NDAs and efficacy supplements. Priority review applies to the time frame for FDA review of completed NDA applications and is separate from and independent of the Fast Track and accelerated approval mechanisms. The classification system, which does not preclude the FDA from doing work on other projects, provides a way of prioritizing NDAs upon receipt and throughout the application review process. 
 Priority designation applies to new drugs that have the potential for providing significant improvement compared to marketed products in the treatment or prevention of a disease. Hence, even if an NDA is initially classified as a priority application, this status can change during the FDA review process; for example, if another product is approved for the same disease for which there was no previously available therapy. In addition, priority review does not guarantee that a product candidate will receive regulatory approval or that the FDA will adhere to the shortened review time frame described in the priority review guidance. 
 Also, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. 
 In June 2016, tucatinib was granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of advanced HER2+ metastatic breast cancer. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 After regulatory approval of a product candidate is obtained, we are required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. Holders of an approved NDA or BLA are required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes certain procedural, substantive and recordkeeping requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort on production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 We use, and anticipate that we will continue to use, third party manufacturers to produce our product candidates in clinical and commercial quantities. Future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. 
 
10 
 
In addition, as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the products safety or efficacy. Also, we may be required to comply with new government requirements in the future. 
 Canadian and Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates outside the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must comply with the requirements of the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the products in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the approval process may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. 
 Under the Canadian regulatory system, Health Canada is the regulatory body that governs the clinical trials of investigational products and the approval of drugs for commercial sale. Accordingly, any company that wishes to conduct a clinical trial in Canada must submit a clinical trial application to Health Canada. Health Canada reviews the application and notifies the company within 30 days if the application is found to be deficient. If the application is deemed acceptable, Health Canada will issue a letter to the company within the 30-day review period which means the company may proceed with its clinical trial(s). 
 Under European Union regulatory systems, we must also meet applicable regulatory requirements before commencing a clinical trial in any country in the European Union. To obtain approval for commercial sale, we may submit marketing authorizations either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization from one member state may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the application and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. There are also separate regulatory requirements that a sponsor must meet to obtain reimbursement for an approved drug under the national health systems in each country in the European Union before it may be lawfully marketed. 
 Reimbursement 
 Sales of biopharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of reimbursement from health insurers, health maintenance organizations and other private third-party payers, and from government programs including Medicare. Each private and governmental third-party payer may have its own policy regarding what products it will cover, the conditions under which it will cover such products, and how much it will pay for such products. Once a product is approved for commercial sale, third party payers will determine, based upon their policies, whether to reimburse for the product and how much of the price will be reimbursed to patients. Generally, drug sponsors will work with private third-party payers in this process and it can be time consuming and expensive. Reimbursement from private third-party payers may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. Generally, once a drug is approved by the FDA, it is covered by Medicare and other federal government programs. However, the amount of reimbursement to a patient for the drug may be determined by the manner in which the drug is dispensed and administered (e.g. by a pharmacy or by a physician practice or hospital). Because of the perception that the costs of new drugs are excessive, there is increasing pressure to implement price controls for drugs reimbursed by federal government programs in order to contain costs. 
 We anticipate that the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These cost containment measures may include: 
 

 | restrictions on government funded reimbursement for drugs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | restrictions on healthcare providers;
--+--------------------------------------


 | challenges to the pricing of drugs or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | reform of drug importation laws; and
--+-------------------------------------


 | expansion of use of managed care systems in which healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
11 
 
We are unable to predict what legislation, regulations or policies, if any, relating to the healthcare industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what the magnitude of the effect such legislation, regulations or policies would have on our business. Any cost containment measures, including those listed above, or other healthcare system reforms that are adopted could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and profitability. 
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. 
 Research and Development 
 We devote a substantial portion of our resources to developing new product candidates. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we expended approximately $44.0 million, $27.5 million and $23.5 million, respectively, on research and development activities. Higher research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to greater activity related to the development of our product candidates. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 71 employees. A number of our management and professional employees have had prior experience with other pharmaceutical or medical products companies. 
 Our ability to develop marketable products and to establish and maintain our competitive position in light of technological developments will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense. We have also chosen to outsource activities where skills are in short supply or where it is economically prudent to do so. 
 None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
