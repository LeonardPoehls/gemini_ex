Overview of key events of the year ended 2016
 
During 2016, the Company continued to pursue its goal of obtaining FDA approval for it’s product NovaDerm®. If approved, NovaDerm will be the first and only autologous, cultured skin substitute product allowed for medical use on burns requiring grafting. We started the year with a comprehensive set of objectives to achieve this goal. The following is a review of the major milestones achieved during the year:
 
1. Our contract laboratory completed the laboratory portion of their analytical research services and we received their final report. This was a lengthy process in which we identified certain potential product improvements that we continue to evaluate internally. The final research report was a crucial part of our FDA submissions for an Orphan Designation and Pre-IND (Investigational New Drug).
 
2. We finalized and executed two key contracts. The first contract was for the fabrication of a collagen scaffold with Bovine Collagen Products LLC (BCP). A collagen scaffold is a platform on which skin cells are grown. BCPs novel approach in the production of the scaffolds led to some potential product improvements. The second contract was for our needed supply of Closed Herd collagen with Pure Med Farma LLC, a related company. Collagen is a bovine derived product which is an essential part of the scaffold, and in order to be compliant with current FDA guidance documents on the use of animal source materials in humans, we are required to use such Closed Herd collagen in our Novaderm product. As far as we are aware, Pure Med Farma is the only company to file a Closed Herd Quality System as a Master File with the FDA, and thus is the only supplier of such Closed Herd bovine collagen. Our regulatory consultants worked closely with Pure Med Farma to ensure the acceptance of their products for inclusion in the manufacturing process of NovaDerm. Under the terms of our arrangement with Pure Med Farma, the expenses we incurred for such consultants related to the filing of the Pure Med Farma Master File were added into a secured convertible promissory note issued to us by Pure Med Farma (PMF Note). In addition to other rights and remedies, the PMF Note grants Regenicin the right to convert part of the principal balance into equity in Pure Med Farma. As previously reported, two officers of the Company are principals in Pure Med Farma.
 
3. We received notice from the Patent and Trademark Office that we are now the owner of the registered trademark NovaDerm®.
 
4. We applied for and in August secured an Orphan Designation, as a biologic, from the Office of Orphan Products Development of the FDA for the treatment of burns requiring skin grafting with NovaDerm®. The Orphan Designation granted was thus broader than the proposed indication of “treatment of patients with deep-partial or full-thickness thermal burns greater than or equal to 30% total body surface area”. The FDA's Orphan designation is granted to promote the development of unmet clinical needs with new therapies for rare diseases and disorders. Orphan Product terminology is applied to Orphan designated products proven safe and effective, and the approved Orphan Product entitles the product, up to seven years of US market exclusivity. In addition, there are other financial benefits along with the FDA’s support during the approval process.
 
5. We submitted a pre-IND meeting request in September of 2016, and then our representatives met telephonically with FDA officials at the end of October 2016. The Agency addressed our questions and provided guidance on our planned NovaDerm® development pathway going forward. It was agreed that Pure Med Farma would perform American Society of Testing and Materials  testing to fulfill current ASTM requirements. We are working closely with Pure Med Farma to ensure this testing can be completely promptly. 
 
6. We selected a well-known and respected global Clinical Research Organization (CRO) that will assist us with our final Investigational New Drug (IND) application submission and the clinical trial process, including site selection, documentation, physician training, patient recruitment and a final clinical report on the results of the trials. An IND application is the document filed with the FDA to request permission to proceed with clinical trials. This application includes the candidate product's research, chemistry, manufacturing controls and processes, pre-clinical safety, clinical trial protocols, and more.

Our Business Moving Forward In 2017
 
First and foremost, we must raise additional funds to finalize the IND application, and begin the clinical trials. It is estimated that the cost to finalize the IND will be approximately 1.5 million dollars, and the cost to complete Phase1 of the clinical trial will be approximately 2 million dollars. Our major focus in obtaining this funding has been to minimize shareholders' dilution as much as possible, and consequently we are primarily pursuing financing through the issuance of a debt instrument, as well as international licensing agreements.
 
We have begun the preliminary planning for the clinical trials to the extent we are able, based on funding constraints. As mentioned above, we have chosen a CRO to assist in our IND submission and conducting the trials. Clinical site selection and patient recruitment should be somewhat simpler than other clinical trials, as we are limited in site selection to the 150 burn centers qualified to treat catastrophic burns. In addition, the surgical protocol will be similar to the grafting procedures currently in use at those facilities. NovaDerm® should thus require minimal physician training.
 
The initial trials are planned to begin with ten subjects with an Initial Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) review of safety on the first three subjects once they have reached 6 months follow-up. We do not intend to interrupt our trial waiting for the DSMB report.
 
Our management is considering various possibilities and approaches to obtaining clinical trial materials and manufcturing. While no final decision has been made, management’s approach is to set up the trials so as to allow for a seamless transition into commercial production upon approval. 
 
In summary, as we move forward in 2017 we hope to accomplish the following milestones:
 

• | Secure interim financing to finalize product development needed to support the IND; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Complete a second round of financing in order to conduct 10 patient clinical trials with NovaDerm® and finalize required manufacturing engineering runs and validations; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Work with Pure Med Farma to finalize Collagen Scaffold Testing Specifications for NovaDerm®; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Proposed New Product:
 
We expect our first cultured skin substitute product, NovaDerm™, to be a multi-layered tissue-engineered skin prepared by utilizing autologous (patient’s own) skin cells. It is expected to be a graftable collagen based cultured epithelium implant that produces a skin substitute containing both epidermal and dermal components with a collagen base. Clinically, we expect our Cultured Skin substitute self-to-self skin graft product will behave the same as split thickness allograft skin. Our Autologous cultured skin substitute should not be rejected by the immune system of the patient, unlike with porcine or cadaver celluar grafts. Immune system rejection is a serious concern in Xeno-transplant procedures which may have a cellular component. The use of our cultured skin substitute should not require any specialized physician training because it is applied the same as in a standard allograft procedure.
 
Clinically speaking, a product designed to treat a life threatening condition must be available for the patient when needed. Our Culture skin substitute is being developed to be ready to apply to the patient when the patient is ready for grafting, within the first month of the patient being admitted to the hospital. Patients with serious burn injuries may not be in a condition to be grafted on a predefined schedule made more than a month in advance. Therefore, in order to accommodate the patient’s needs, we are striving to ensure that our cultured skin substitute will be designed with an adequate shelf life and manufacturing schedule to ensure it is available whether the patient needs it the first month, or any day after, until the patient’s wound is completely covered and closed.

Our second product is anticipated to be TempaDerm®. TempaDerm® uses cells obtained from human donors to develop banks of cryo-preserved (frozen) cells and cultured skin substitute to provide a continuous supply of non-allogenic skin substitutes to treat much smaller wound areas on patients, such as ulcers. This product is expected to have applications in the treatment of chronic skin wounds such as diabetic ulcers, decubitus ulcers and venous stasis ulcers. This product is also expected to be similar to our burn indication product, except for the indications, and it will not depend totally on autologous cells. In fact, it may be possible to use the excess cultured skin that was originally produced for use on the patient that donated the cells used to grow the skin. Hopefully, TempaDerm® will be able to take this original cultured skin and use it on someone other than the original donor. As currently planned, TempaDerm® has the possibility of using banked cells, or even frozen cultured skin substitutes, to carry inventory to satisfy unknown needs or large volumes to meet the demands created in large scale disasters. Because of our focus to date on NovaDerm®, we have taken only limited steps toward the development of TempaDerm®.
    We believe this technology has many different uses beyond the burn indication. The other uses may include chronic wounds, reconstructive surgery, other complex organs and tissues. Some of the individual components of our planned cultured skin substitute technology is expected to be developed for devices, such as tendon wraps made of collagen or collagen temporary coverings of large area wounds to protect the patients from infections while waiting for the permanent skin substitute. The collagen technology used for cultured skin substitutes, as designed, is expected to be used for many different applications in wound healing and stem cell technology and even drug delivery systems.
 
We could pursue any or all of the indications simultaneously if financing permitted, but for now we will seek approval for burns first as an Orphan Biologic Product to establish significant safety data and then Biological License Approval.
 
Competition

Several companies have developed or are developing products that propose to approach the markets described above. These companies include:
 
Amarantus Biosciences, Inc.
 
Smith & Nephew Wound Management 
-----------------------------------


Genzyme Biosurgery
------------------


Integra Life Sciences Corporation 
-------------------------------------


LifeCell Corporation/Kinetic Concepts 
-----------------------------------------


Organogenesis Inc
-----------------


Intercytex
----------


Genzyme
-------


Advanced Biohealing/ Shire 
------------------------------


Cy Ttera/ NovoCell/ViaCyte
--------------------------


Biomimetic Therapeutics Inc. 
--------------------------------


RTI Biologics 
---------------------

 
Each of these companies has a proprietary approach to these markets, but none has yet penetrated the cell therapy markets fully. Four companies (Smith and Nephew, Genzyme. Organogenesis, Integra and Advanced Biohealing) have products that are FDA approved for use in burn patients.
 
We believe our products are believed to be superior in design and function and, thus, provide significant advantages over the competitors listed above. The advantages of our cultured skin substitute include simultaneous delivery of Autologus epidermal keratinocytes and fibroblasts organized with a unique collagen base.
 Clinical skin replacements and grafts are in high demand for the treatment of skin injuries: they represent approximately 50% of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine market revenues. In 2009, the potential United States market for tissue-engineered skin replacements and substitutes totaled approximately $18.9 billion, based on a target patient population of approximately 5.0 million. By the year 2019, the total potential target population for the use of tissue-engineered skin replacements and substitutes is expected to increase to 6.4 million, resulting in a potential US market of approximately $24.3 billion.

Government Regulation
 
The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-85) provides that Orphan Product applications for pediatric use only, or for use in both pediatric and adult patients, that are approved on or after September 27, 2007, are assigned an annual distribution number (ADN) and may be sold for profit (subject to the upper limit of the ADN). In addition, once a product receives an Orphan BLA, the developer of the product receives up to seven years market exclusivity for a specific indication following the product’s approval by the FDA.
 
Unrestricted sales of our cultured skin substitute will require full approval after data for safety and efficacy are collected from a multi-center study. Once an IND is submitted, we expect enrollment and treatment are expected to require a one year evaluation on each patient. The final 9 months of the evaluation is expected to be only a monitoring period. After collection of data from the clinical trial and submission to FDA, six months is typically planned for FDA’s review and decision. Having an Orphan designation of which the indication is life threatening and there is an unmet need for catastrophic burns, the review time may be reduced significantly.
 
Intellectual Property
 
In August 2010, we paid $7,500 and obtained the rights to the trademarks PermaDerm® and TempaDerm® from KJR-10 Corp. In November of 2014, we sold the PermaDerm® trademark to Amarantus Biosciences as part of an Asset Purchase Agreement whereby they purchase all our rights to the Lonza lawsuit. In 2016, we received a registered trademark for NovaDerm®.
Employees
 
As of September 30, 2016, we had 3 employees. 
 
Subsidiaries
 
On September 11, 2013 we completed formation documents with respect to the formation of a wholly-owned subsidiary created with the sole purpose of conducting research in the State of Georgia.
 
The subsidiary was given the name, Regenicin Research of Georgia, LLC, and was accepted by the Georgia Secretary of State on September 25, 2013, with an official certificate of formation being issued on September 26, 2013.
