ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
Mikros Systems Corporation (the “Company”, “we” or “us”) designs and manufactures software, hardware and electronic systems used to maintain complex distributed systems. Examples of such systems include defense equipment such as radars and combat systems, and commercial and industrial applications such as printing presses, power distribution, and utility systems, and Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) systems. 
 
Over the past decade, our principal customer has been the U.S. Department of Defense, primarily the U.S. Navy. We provide the following two key systems to the Navy for maintenance of radars and combat systems:
 

● | ADEPT®, the Adaptive Diagnostic Electronic Portable Testset, is a PC-based maintenance automation workstation used to maintain the Navy’s premier AN/SPY-1 phased array radar on Cruisers (CG) and Destroyers (DDG).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ADSSS®, the ADEPT Distance Support Sensor Suite, is a Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) system used to monitor Combat System Elements (CSEs) onboard the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
More recently, we have developed and marketed software products to analyze maintenance data collected from target systems, optimize maintenance procedures, and predict failures. Our Prognostics Framework® (PF) and Diagnostic Profiler® (DP) products provide software capabilities which complement our maintenance hardware products (ADEPT and ADSSS) and allow us to provide complete hardware/software solutions for advanced maintenance, particularly of complex distributed systems. Now that we have a complete hardware/software solution for advanced maintenance, we are expanding into commercial and industrial markets.
 
Our Products
 
Adaptive Diagnostic Electronic Portable Testset (ADEPT). ADEPT, also known as the AN/PSM-132, is an automated maintenance workstation designed to significantly reduce the time required to align all variants of the AN/SPY1 Radar System aboard U.S. Navy AEGIS cruisers and destroyers while optimizing system performance and readiness. ADEPT systems are currently deploying on all AEGIS CG and DDG platforms to support the AN/SPY1 radar system. Since the system uses commercial instrument case and modules, ADEPT units can be modified to support both preventative maintenance and condition-based maintenance of other radars and complex electronic systems in military or commercial applications such as the AN/SPQ-9B. ADEPT represents an innovative approach to Navy shipboard maintenance, integrating modular instrumentation cards in a rugged enclosure with an onboard computer, input and output devices, networking hardware, removable hard drives, and a touch-screen display. A custom software application provides the user interface and integrates the hardware with a database that stores user information, instrument readings, maintenance requirements, and training aids. ADEPT is designed to be adapted to other complex shipboard systems, and provide integrated distance support capabilities for remote diagnostics and troubleshooting by shore-based Navy experts.
 
Key benefits of ADEPT include:
 
• | Distance support capability enabling remote (shore based) system support by subject matter experts and fleet-wide system analysis;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduction in the amount of electronic test equipment required for organizational level support;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Modularity and programmability to overcome obsolescence issues encountered with current test equipment and support capability enhancements in future systems; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Elimination of the need for traditional manuals, paper documentation and discreet test equipment thereby easing the maintenance burden by integrating the required test equipment functionality and automated testing process and storing all necessary documentation within the ADEPT system.

As of December 31, 2017, we have delivered a total of 200 ADEPT units to our Navy customers. 
 
A further goal for ADEPT has been to expand the capabilities to other radar systems. In January 2014, we were awarded a $0.5 million service contract by the U.S. Navy to extend ADEPT to a second U.S. Navy radar system, the AN/SPS-49. These services are expected to assist in optimizing performance for the Ballistic Missile Defense Mission.
 
ADEPT Distance Support Sensor Suite (ADSSS). In 2013, we started development of the ADEPT Distance Support Sensor Suite, or ADSSS, for the Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). Our system has now matured and has earned Nomenclature AN/SYM-3 from the Navy. The LCS is the U.S. Navy’s latest combat warship. ADSSS is a network-enabled system that can be configured to monitor multiple shipboard systems and report maintenance data onshore for further analysis to detect trends and predict failures. AN/SYM-3 provides an open architecture approach with industry-standard hardware, and cybersecurity compliant software to acquire and process system operational and maintenance data. The AN/SYM-3 system fully automates the capture of system operation, environment and maintenance data to provide unattended operation. The system monitors key parameters and sends alert notifications when parameters move out of tolerance.
 
The first full AN/SYM-3 system was successfully completed on the ship and shore installation and on the Littoral Combat Ship USS Independence. We are currently working to have 4 more full systems installed by the end of 2018 and will be on both variants of the LCS, currently planned to be at least 32 ships. AN/SYM-3 with its remote monitoring and prognostics capabilities have also generated interest in other systems within LCS and in other ship classes, including AEGIS, and we are currently pursuing several related opportunities.
 
Diagnostic Profiler. The Diagnostic Profiler is an integrated development environment for developing diagnostic capabilities used in maintenance, embedded diagnostics, and troubleshooting applications. The software provides diagnostic services to its host application, including fault call-outs, suggested “next best” test to further isolate faults, and direct maintenance actions. When additional faults are identified, the software prioritizes the fault call-outs by probability. The use of the diagnostic profiler eliminates the need for the development and maintenance of diagnostic flow charts and hard-coded text sequences. This reduces the effort required to correct bugs and design changes and over the life of the system, could result in significant cost savings. This system is used by clients and has also generated yearly support contracts for service.
 
Prognostics Framework. Prognostics Framework is an analysis software for framework that implements real-time prognostics, diagnostics, and status monitoring to support embedded prognostic applications, health management systems and condition-based maintenance applications. The Prognostics Framework software institutes an information framework that organizes relevant data related to: (i) the condition of the system; (ii) the system’s ability to perform required functions over specific time intervals; and (iii) the need for maintenance actions and repair parts. The Prognostics Framework has been used to implement a complete health management system on one of the first radar systems to require prognostics as a key element of its overall solutions. Other potential applications include complex computer networks, power generators, power supply, cooling and environmental systems.
 
Government Contracts
 
In March 2016, we received a contract award valued at approximately $0.15 million to provide Initial System Familiarization Training of the ADEPT system on all CG-47 and DDG-51 Class ships. The first event in Norfolk has already occurred, and a second event in San Diego is currently scheduled for May.

In April 2017, we received contract awards totaling $2.0 million from the U.S. Navy to extend the capabilities of the ADSSS Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) system to support a fourth Navy radar system, the MK 99. The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) office in Dahlgren, VA provided $0.5 million of the total funding to support this effort. 
In July 2017 and November 2017, we received modifications which added funding to our ADEPT IDIQ Contract, for engineering services in the amounts of $0.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively. These awards will allow us to continue to support the ADEPT product line in the fleet, implement necessary software enhancements, and provide general support of the program.
In August 2017, we received a modification to our ADEPT sustainment delivery order, adding $0.5 million to allow our M&D Center in Largo, Florida to continue to provide bi-annual sustainment services for units cycling through the M & D center from the fleet. The sustainment efforts include implementing modifications of existing units (54 in total) awaiting fielding.
In September 2017, we received a delivery order in the amount of $2.4 million for the production and delivery of additional ADEPT units. These new units will continue our fleet support on Aegis cruisers and destroyers in the U.S. Navy. In 2018, we received additional modifications to our ADEPT IDIQ Contract and incremental awards for continued engineering services in the aggregate amount of $0.42 million. This funding will support necessary software enhancements to sustainment services for the ADEPT product out of our M&D Center in Largo, Florida.
Manufacturing and Depot Center
 
We operate a Manufacturing and Depot center in Largo, Florida which has been manufacturing our ADEPT systems for our DoD customers since 2010. Our center is American National Standards Institute (ANSI) ISO 9001:2008 certified for assembly and test of electronic assemblies of military and commercial applications. We have also established a quality management system which complies with Naval Sea Systems Command Standard Item 009-04. In addition to facility certifications, we have personnel trained and certified in numerous IPC – Association Connecting Electronics Industries, Lean Six Sigma (LSS), and Manufacturing Skill Standards Council (MSSC) specialties. We are offering integration, kitting, build-to-print, and box-build with testing services to commercial customers and DoD contractors. In September 2017, we received our first commercial full-rate order for integration services in which we delivered 2,650 units. Expanding the Largo facility’s light manufacturing and integration services for commercial customers and other DoD contractors is a key component of our long-term growth strategy.
Corporate Growth & Strategy
 
Our strategy for continued growth is based on continuing expansion of our defense business and executing new initiatives to apply our advanced maintenance technology in commercial markets. With regard to the defense industry, we expect to continue expanding our technology base, backlog and revenue by continuing our active participation in the DoD SBIR program and bidding on projects that fall within our areas of expertise. These areas include electronic systems engineering and integration, radar systems engineering, combat/C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers & Intelligence) systems engineering, and communications engineering. We believe that we can utilize the intellectual property developed under our various SBIR awards to develop proprietary products, such as ADEPT and ADSSS, with broad appeal in both the government and commercial marketplace. Our state-of-the-art test equipment can be used by many commercial and governmental customers such as the FAA, radio and television stations, cell phone stations, and airlines. Second, we will continue to pursue SBIR projects with the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Navy, and other government agencies. Third, we believe that through our marketing of products, such as ADEPT, we will develop key relationships with prime defense contractors. Our strategy is to develop these relationships into long-term, key subcontractor roles on future major defense programs awarded to these prime contractors. 
 
With regard to commercial markets, our Diagnostics Profiler and Prognostics Framework software offerings complement our hardware products and allow us to provide complete hardware/software solutions for advanced maintenance applications. Current customers for these systems include major multinational corporations such as HP, which recently extended our Diagnostic Profiler software support with for a fifth year. We continue to receive repeat orders from these customers to support their applications. We plan to provide “condition-based maintenance” systems for applications such as FAA radar surveillance and support systems, power distribution and utilities infrastructure, commercial shipping, cooling and environmental systems, and other “complex distributed systems” to commercial customers. In that regard, we are currently developing a condition-based maintenance solution for heating ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration (HVAC) equipment based on our proprietary Prognostics Framework solution. We have deployed two active pilot systems that are providing key maintenance data on a daily basis to service technicians.

In 2018, our primary strategic focus is to continue as a premium provider of R&D and product development services to the defense industry, generate multiple task orders under our two IDIQ contracts, and expand our commercial business through marketing and sales of our Prognostics Framework and Diagnostic Profiler software products. We will also seek to generate incremental revenue through providing light assembly and production services to commercial customers at our manufacturing and depot center in Largo, Florida.
 
Over the longer term, we intend to further develop advanced maintenance technologies and implement these technologies in products for deployment in defense applications and to expand into more commercial applications. We believe that many of our core capabilities, remote monitoring, rugged systems, predictive maintenance and communications expertise, are applicable to other industries that work with complex distributed systems, such as utilities, communications and transportation systems. We are currently in discussions with certain industry participants regarding this initiative.
 
During recent years, the combination of spending caps, discretionary spending cuts, sequestration and reductions in defense spending has caused, and may in the future continue to cause, delays in funding certain projects. This may negatively impact our revenues and profits.
Competition
 
The SBIR arena is highly competitive and we compete against numerous small businesses for SBIR awards. In our general business area of electronic defense systems and products, we also compete against many larger companies that have greater financial and human resources. We believe that the primary competitive factors in obtaining SBIR contracts are technical expertise, prior relevant experience, and cost. We believe that our history of completing projects in a timely and efficient manner, along with the experience of our management and technical personnel, enables us to compete effectively for SBIR grants.
Intellectual Property
 
Under SBIR data rights, we are protected from unauthorized use of SBIR-developed technology and data for a period of five years after acceptance of all items to be delivered under a particular SBIR contract or any follow-on contract.
Customer Concentration and Dependence on Federal Government
 
Substantially all of our revenue is derived from SBIR and IDIQ contracts for the federal government. Approximately 98% of our revenues in 2016 were realized in connection with task orders issued under our IDIQ contract with the Naval Surface Warfare Center to deliver ADEPT units and provide related support services. In 2017, approximately 99% of our revenues were realized in connection with task orders under the IDIQ contract for ADEPT units and development of the ADSSS system. Although our operations are not subject to any particular government approval or regulations, we are dependent upon funding being made available to the DoD in amounts sufficient to cover the SBIR grants and other DoD contracts for which we compete.
Research and Development
 
We specialize in the development of electronic systems technology for military and commercial applications. All of our research and development costs in 2017 and 2016 were for the benefit of our customers, who are agencies of the federal government. The customer- sponsored research and development projects are performed under contracts and are accounted for as contract costs as the work is performed. In future periods, we may engage in company-sponsored research and development projects which would be expensed as incurred.
Backlog
 
Backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts as work is performed. Our backlog consists of (i) ADEPT units to be developed and delivered to the federal government together continued development and testing and (ii) ADSSS systems to be developed and derived together with related engineering and logistics support. At December 31, 2017, our backlog was $6.8 million.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had twenty-nine full-time employees of which twenty-two work at our Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, Research & Development Center, one works at our Princeton, New Jersey corporate headquarters, one works at our Washington, DC office, and five work at our Largo, Florida Manufacturing and Depot Center. None of our employees belong to a labor union. We believe relations with our employees are good. We also use the services of subcontractors and consultants as necessary to aid in software and hardware development and for the manufacture of products.
