Item 1: Business
INTRODUCTION
American Railcar Industries, Inc. (ARI) is a prominent North American designer and manufacturer of hopper and tank railcars, which are currently the two largest markets within the railcar industry. We provide our railcar customers with integrated solutions through a comprehensive set of high quality products and related services offered by our three reportable segments: manufacturing, railcar leasing and railcar services. Manufacturing consists of railcar manufacturing and railcar and industrial component manufacturing. We use certain of these components in our own railcar manufacturing and sell certain of these products to third parties. Railcar leasing consists of railcars manufactured by us and leased to third parties under operating leases. Railcar services consist of railcar repair, engineering and field services. Our business model combines manufacturing, railcar leasing and railcar services and is designed to support the industry with complete railcar solutions over the full life cycle of the railcar. Financial information about our business segments for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is set forth in Note 19 of our consolidated financial statements. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to “our company,” “the Company”, “we,” “us” and “our,” refer to us and our consolidated subsidiaries and our predecessors.
We were founded and incorporated in Missouri in 1988, reincorporated in Delaware in 2006 and reincorporated again in North Dakota in 2009. Since our formation, we have grown our business from being a small provider of railcar components and railcar maintenance services to an integrated provider of direct sale and leased railcars, railcar components and railcar maintenance and repair services. Our primary customers include shippers, leasing companies, industrial companies, and Class I railroads. In servicing this customer base, we believe our comprehensive railcar leasing and service offerings and our railcar components manufacturing business help us to further penetrate the general railcar manufacturing market. This breadth of product and service offerings provides us with opportunities to partner with our customers to improve our products and services and enhance the value of our offerings.
Our operations include eight manufacturing plants that fabricate and assemble raw materials, mainly steel, into railcars, railcar components and industrial components; eight railcar repair plants; and eleven mobile repair (mobile units) and mini repair shop (mini shop) locations. Our railcar services business includes railcar repair and maintenance, painting, lining, cleaning, inspections, engineering support and field services. In addition, at times we use our manufacturing facilities to perform certain repair projects. For example, we are currently using a portion of our tank railcar manufacturing facility to perform railcar repair work as it offers a cost effective way to perform repairs and retrofit services in a production line set-up. See Item 2 “Properties” for further discussion of our properties. 
We are currently party to two joint ventures. Our Ohio Castings Company, LLC (Ohio Castings) joint venture has the capability to manufacture various railcar components for sale, through one of the joint venture partners, to third parties and the other joint venture partners. As discussed below, this joint venture is currently idled. Our Axis, LLC (Axis) joint venture manufactures and sells axles to its joint venture partners for use and distribution both domestically and internationally in traditional freight railcar markets and other railcar markets, such as transit and locomotive railcars. 
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
We design and manufacture special, customized and general-purpose railcars and a wide range of components primarily for the North American railcar and industrial markets. We have several different railcar types in our broad spectrum of hopper and tank railcar families that service various commodities. Customers may select the size and configuration of the railcar to best suit their needs. By offering our customers both direct sale and railcar leasing opportunities, we continue to foster long-term relationships with key customers, helping them to meet their business and financial objectives. We also support the railcar industry by offering a variety of comprehensive railcar repair services, ranging from full to light repair, engineering and on-site repairs and maintenance through our various repair facilities, including mobile units and mini shops. See Note 19 of our consolidated financial statements for financial information by segment.
Manufacturing 
We primarily manufacture two types of railcars, hopper and tank railcars, but have the ability to produce additional railcar types. We offer our customers the option to buy or lease railcars. We also manufacture components for railcar and industrial markets.

Hopper railcars
We manufacture both general service and specialty carbon steel and stainless steel hopper railcars at our Paragould plant. All of our hopper railcars may be equipped with varying combinations of hatches, discharge outlets and protective coatings to provide our customers with a railcar designed to perform in precise operating environments. The flexible nature of our hopper railcar design allows it to be quickly modified to suit changing customer needs. This flexibility can continue to provide value after the initial purchase or lease because our railcars may be converted for reassignment to other services.
We have several different railcar types in our hopper family that target specific customers and specific commodities, including plastic pellets, industrial and food grade starches and flours, grain, corrosive chemicals, heavy ore minerals, clays, cement and sand. Our hopper railcars are specifically designed for shipping a variety of dry bulk products, from light density products, such as plastic pellets, to high-density products, such as cement and sand. Depending upon customer requirements, they can operate in a gravity, positive pressure or vacuum pneumatic unloading environment. CenterFlow® and other lines of hopper railcars provide protection for a wide range of dry bulk products and enhance the associated loading, unloading and cleaning processes. Improvements include enhanced designs of the shape of the railcars, underframes, outlet mounting frames, loading hatches, discharge outlets and rotary-dump, which improve the cargo loading and unloading processes.
Tank railcars
We manufacture general service, pressurized, coiled, lined and insulated carbon steel and stainless steel tank railcars at our Marmaduke plant. Our tank railcars are designed to transport a variety of commodities including chemicals, natural gas liquids, vegetable oil, corn syrup and other food products, ethanol and crude oil. Our pressure tank railcars transport products that require a pressurized state due to their liquid, semi-gaseous or gaseous nature, including chlorine, anhydrous ammonia, liquid propane and butane. Our pressure tank railcars feature a thicker pressure retaining inner shell that is separated from a jacketed outer shell by layers of insulation, thermal protection or both. Our pressure tank railcars are made from specific grades of normalized steel that are selected for toughness and ease of welding. Most of our tank railcars feature a sloped bottom tank that provides improved drainage. Many of our tank railcars feature coils that can be steam-heated to decrease cargo viscosity, which speeds unloading. We can alter the design of our tank railcars to address specific customer or regulatory requirements and we can also apply linings to tank railcars.
Other railcar types
We have the design capabilities, manufacturing flexibility and expertise to produce many other railcar types as we have in the past and may produce in the future, as demand may dictate.
Component manufacturing
In addition to manufacturing railcars, we also manufacture custom and standard railcar components. Our products include discharge outlets for hopper railcars, tank railcar components and valves, tank heads, manway covers, wheel pair sets, underframes, outlet components and running boards for industrial and railroad customers and hitches for the intermodal market. We use these components in our own railcar manufacturing and sell certain of these products to third parties.
We also manufacture aluminum and special alloy steel castings that we sell primarily to industrial customers. These products include castings for the trucking, construction, mining and oil and gas exploration markets, as well as finished, machined castings and other custom machined products.
Consulting and license agreements
In January 2013, we entered into a purchasing and engineering services agreement and license with ACF Industries, LLC (ACF), an affiliate of Mr. Carl Icahn, our principal beneficial stockholder through IELP. Under this agreement, we provide purchasing and engineering support to ACF in connection with ACF's manufacture and sale of certain tank railcars at its facility. Additionally, we provide certain intellectual property required to manufacture and sell such tank railcars. In December 2016, ARI and ACF amended this agreement to, among other things, extend the termination date from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, subject to certain early termination events.
Railcar Leasing
Customers may lease our hopper and tank railcars through various leasing options. Maintenance of leased railcars may be provided, in part, through our railcar repair and refurbishment facilities. The terms of our railcar leases generally range from 5 to 10 years and generally provide for fixed monthly rentals. As of December 31, 2016, we had 11,268 railcars in our lease fleet, with over 99% under lease.

Railcar Services
Our railcar services segment focuses on railcar repair, engineering and field services. Our primary customers for services provided by this group are leasing companies and shippers of specialty hopper and tank railcars. Our railcar services segment provides us with insight into our customers' railcar needs, which we use to improve service and product offerings across all our business segments.
Repair services
This component of our business includes both our full service repair and refurbishment plants and our light service repair plants, which are strategically located to serve our customers. Our full service repair plants have full cleaning, interior and exterior coating, repair / rebuilding, non-destructive testing and engineering capabilities for a variety of railcar types. Our light repair plants provide a focused offering to specific areas, in addition to quicker throughput. We have the capacity to handle large reassignment projects, heavy wreck repair, and conversions to make, or keep, railcars compliant with regulations, as well as many other customer requirements. The capacity at these facilities will also aid us, and our customers, in complying with the Federal Railroad Administration's Revised Directive, as discussed below.
Engineering and field services
We offer a wide array of field services through our mobile units and mini shops. Working together with our field services network, our engineers are available to assist in quickly resolving railcar maintenance and regulatory compliance issues. Information learned in the field is used to educate other aspects of our business, allowing us to recognize and address maintenance and compliance issues that affect our customers' fleets.
Consulting and license agreements
In April 2015, we entered into a repair services and support agreement with ACF. Under this agreement, we provide certain sales and administrative and technical services, materials and purchasing support and engineering services to ACF to provide repair and retrofit services (Repair Services). Additionally, we provide a non-exclusive and non-assignable license of certain intellectual property related to the Repair Services for railcars. 
SALES AND MARKETING
We sell and market our products and services in North America. Currently, American Railcar Leasing, LLC (ARL) markets our railcars for sale or lease, subject to certain exceptions, and acts as our manager to lease railcars on our behalf for a fee. ARL is an affiliate of Mr. Carl Icahn, our principal beneficial stockholder through IELP. In addition to ARL's marketing efforts on our behalf, we market our railcars for direct sale to certain leasing customers and sell our component products and railcar services. 
On December 16, 2016, the equity holders of ARL entered into a purchase agreement (the ARL Purchase Agreement) to sell their interests in ARL to SMBC Rail Services, LLC (the Buyer). Subject to the terms and conditions of the ARL Purchase Agreement, the initial closing is anticipated to occur in the second quarter of 2017. In anticipation of the expected sale of ARL (the ARL Sale) to the Buyer, ARI and ARL entered into a railcar management transition agreement (the RMTA) to manage the transition, from ARL to ARI, of our railcar leasing business. See Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the RMTA. Pursuant to the RMTA, following the transition of management of our railcar leasing business, we will begin to market all of our railcars for sale or lease, as well as continue to sell our component products and railcar services. 
Certain of our component products are sold directly to customers via catalogs and the Internet through which our customers have access to our railcar and industrial components. Our marketing activities include commodity and industry based market research and analyses, advertising via electronic and print publications, participation in trade shows and industry forums and distribution of sales literature and marketing materials. 
In 2016, our top two customers, CP Chemical Company, LLC and Equistar Chemicals, LP, accounted for approximately 17.9% and 12.3% of our consolidated revenues, respectively and no other customers accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. In 2016, sales to our top ten customers accounted for approximately 65.3% of our consolidated revenues.
See Note 19 of our consolidated financial statements for geographical information concerning the sales of our products and services, as well as other sales concentration information.
BACKLOG
We define backlog as the number and sales value of railcars that our customers have committed in writing to purchase or lease from us that have not been shipped. As of December 31, 2016, our total backlog was 3,813 railcars, of which 2,176 railcars 
7

with an estimated value of $198.3 million were orders for direct sale and 1,637 railcars with an estimated market value of $152.2 million were orders for railcars that will be subject to lease. Approximately 67% of the railcars in our backlog are expected to be delivered during 2017, 37% for direct sale and 30% for lease. All of our backlog as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 related to railcars for non-affiliated customers. As of December 31, 2015, our total backlog was 7,081 railcars, of which 5,629 railcars with an estimated value of $550.1 million were orders for direct sale and 1,452 railcars with an estimated market value of $144.7 million were orders for railcars that will be subject to lease.
Railcars for Sale. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 57.1% of the total number of railcars in our backlog were railcars for direct sale. Estimated market value of railcars for direct sale reflects the total revenues expected as if such backlog were converted to actual revenues at the end of the particular period. 
Railcars for Lease. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 42.9% of the total number of railcars in our backlog were for lease, subject to firm orders. Estimated backlog value of railcars that will be subject to lease reflects the estimated market value of each railcar as if it had been sold to a third party. Actual revenues for railcars subject to lease are recognized per the terms of the lease and are not based on the estimated backlog value.
The following table shows our reported railcar backlog and estimated future revenue value attributable to such backlog at the end of the periods shown. The reported backlog includes railcars relating to purchase or lease obligations based upon an assumed mix. 

 | 2016 | | 2015
Railcar backlog at January 1 | 7,081 | | | 11,732 | 
New railcars shipped | (4,836 | ) | | (8,903 | )
New railcar orders | 1,568 | | | 4,252 | 
Railcar backlog at December 31 | 3,813 | | | 7,081 | 
Estimated railcar backlog value at end of period (in thousands) (1) | $ | 350,501 | | | $ | 694,878


(1) | Estimated backlog value reflects the total revenues expected to be attributable to the backlog reported at the end of the particular period as if such backlog were converted to actual revenues. Estimated backlog value reflects known price adjustments for material cost changes but does not reflect a projection of any future material price adjustments that are generally provided for in our customer contracts.

We cannot guarantee that the actual revenue from these orders will equal our reported estimated backlog value or that our future revenue efforts will be successful. Customer orders may be subject to requests for delays in deliveries, inspection rights and other customary industry terms and conditions, which could prevent or delay railcars in our backlog from being shipped and converted into revenue. Historically, we have experienced little variation between the number of railcars ordered and the number of railcars actually shipped. As delivery dates could be extended on certain orders, we cannot guarantee that our reported railcar backlog will convert to revenue in any particular period, if at all.
SUPPLIERS AND MATERIALS
Our business depends on the adequate supply of numerous railcar components, including railcar wheels, brakes, axles, bearings, yokes, tank railcar heads, sideframes, bolsters and other heavy castings, and raw materials, such as steel and normalized steel plate, used in the production and maintenance of railcars. Due to our vertical integration efforts, including our involvement in joint ventures, we are currently able to produce axles, and tank railcar heads and assemble wheel sets, along with numerous other railcar components.
The cost of raw materials and railcar components represents a significant amount of the direct manufacturing costs of our railcar product lines. Our railcar manufacturing contracts generally contain provisions for price adjustments that track fluctuations in the prices of certain raw materials and railcar components, including carbon and stainless steel, so that increases in our manufacturing costs caused by increases in the prices of these raw materials and components are passed on to our customers. Conversely, if the price of those materials or components decreases, a discount is applied to reflect the decrease in cost.
In 2016, our top three suppliers accounted for approximately 37.7% of the total materials that we purchased and our top ten suppliers accounted for approximately 59.6% of the total materials that we purchased.

Steel
We use hot rolled steel coils, as-rolled steel plate and normalized steel plate in our manufacturing operations. We can acquire hot rolled steel coils and standard as-rolled steel plate from several suppliers. However, there are a limited number of qualified domestic suppliers of the form and size of as-rolled and normalized steel plate that we need for manufacturing tank railcars, and these suppliers are our only source of this product. Normalized steel plate is a special form of heat-treated steel that is stronger and is more resistant to puncture than as-rolled steel plate. Normalized steel plate is required by federal regulations to be used in tank railcars carrying certain types of hazardous cargo. 
Castings
Heavy castings that we use in our railcar manufacturing primarily include bolsters and sideframes that are components of truck assemblies, upon which railcars are mounted, as well as couplers and yokes. Historically, we have obtained a significant portion of our castings requirements from our joint venture, Ohio Castings. Beginning in January 2017, Ohio Castings' production was idled by the joint venture partners based on expected industry demand. We expect that Ohio Castings will remain idle through at least the end of 2017, subject to re-evaluation based on changes in future demand expectations. During this idle period, we expect to fulfill all of our castings requirements from third party vendors. 
Axles
Axles, at times, have been a capacity constrained critical component of manufacturing railcars. Our joint venture, Axis, produces railcar axles and is our primary supplier of such axles.
COMPETITION
The North American railcar manufacturing industry has historically been extremely competitive. We compete primarily with Trinity Industries, Inc. (Trinity), The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. (Greenbrier), National Steel Car Limited, and FreightCar America, Inc. in the hopper railcar market and primarily with Trinity, Greenbrier and Union Tank Car Company in the tank railcar market. Competitors have expanded and may continue to expand their capabilities into our core railcar markets.
We also experience intense competition in our railcar leasing business from railcar manufacturers, leasing companies, banks and other financial institutions. Some of our railcar manufacturing competitors produce railcars for use in their own railcar leasing fleets, competing directly with our railcar leasing business and with other leasing companies. Some of this railcar leasing business competition also includes certain of our significant customers and affiliates, including ARL, though provisions in our railcar management contracts with ARL require ARL to treat our railcars consistent with generally accepted industry standards and to adhere to standards of conduct that are at least equal to the efforts used by ARL in its management of its own and other customers’ railcars. As mentioned above, in anticipation of the ARL Sale, ARI and ARL entered into the RMTA to manage the transition, from ARL to ARI, of the management of our railcar leasing business. The RMTA, among other things and subject to its terms, also provides for the termination of, and the discharge and release of obligations under, certain other agreements to which ARI or its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and ARL, on the other hand, are parties, including our railcar management contracts with ARL. See Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the RMTA.
Our competition for the sale of railcar components includes our competitors in the railcar manufacturing market, as well as a concentrated group of companies whose primary business focus is the production of one or more specialty components. We compete with numerous companies in our railcar services businesses, ranging from companies with greater resources than we have to small, local companies.
In addition to price, competition in all of our markets is based on quality, reputation, reliability of delivery, proximity to products and services, customer service and other factors.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We believe that manufacturing expertise, the improvement of existing technology and the development of new products may be more important than patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage. Nevertheless, we have obtained several patents and will continue to make efforts to obtain patents, when available, in connection with our product development and design activities.
ARI®, Pressureaide®, CenterFlow® and our railcar logo are our U.S. registered trademarks. We also have a common law trademark in the name American Railcar. We currently license our trademarks “American Railcar” and the “diamond shape” of our logo to ARL pursuant to a Trademark License Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the RMTA, ARL will be required to discontinue using the name American Railcar and the diamond shape of its logo following the consummation of the 
9

ARL Sale. Each trademark, trade name or service mark of any other company appearing in this report belongs to its respective holder.
In connection with the ARL Sale and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the RMTA, ARL provides us an irrevocable, fully paid, non-transferrable (except as set forth therein), royalty-free license to certain software and databases owned and used by ARL to manage leased railcars. We expect to use this license to manage our railcar leasing business. This license will remain in effect even if the ARL Sale is not consummated.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2016, we had 2,159 full-time employees in various locations throughout the United States and Canada, of which approximately 7.7% were party to domestic collective bargaining agreements at two of our repair facilities and at our Texas manufacturing facility.
REGULATION
The industries in which we operate are subject to extensive regulation by various governmental, regulatory and industry authorities and by federal, state, local and foreign authorities. The primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the railcar industry in the U.S. and Canada are the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the Association of American Railroads (AAR), U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) and Transport Canada (TC). The FRA administers and enforces U.S. Federal laws and regulations relating to railroad safety. These regulations govern equipment and safety compliance standards for railcars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce. The AAR promulgates a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment, relationships among railroads with respect to railcars in interchange and other matters. The AAR also certifies railcar manufacturers and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the U.S. New products must generally undergo AAR testing and approval processes. Because of these regulations, we must maintain certifications with the AAR as a manufacturer of railcars and railcar components, and products that we sell must meet AAR and FRA standards. We must comply with the rules of the USDOT and we are subject to oversight by TC that also requires compliance. 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
We are subject to comprehensive federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment, the management, use, processing, handling, storage, transport or disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, and other laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment. These laws and regulations expose us to liability for the environmental condition of our current or formerly owned or operated facilities and negligent acts, and also may expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for our actions that complied with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken. In addition, these laws may require significant expenditures to achieve compliance, and are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations. Civil and criminal fines and penalties and other sanctions may be imposed for non-compliance with these environmental laws and regulations. Our operations that involve hazardous materials also raise potential risks of liability under common law.
Environmental operating permits are, or may be, required for our operations under these laws and regulations. These operating permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation. We regularly monitor and review our operations, procedures and policies for compliance with permits, laws and regulations. Despite these compliance efforts, risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of our businesses, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.
Certain real property we acquired from ACF in 1994 has been involved in investigation and remediation activities to address contamination. ACF is an affiliate of Mr. Carl Icahn, our principal beneficial stockholder through IELP. Substantially all of the issues identified with respect to these properties relate to the use of these properties prior to their transfer to us by ACF and for which ACF has retained liability for environmental contamination that may have existed at the time of transfer to us. ACF has also agreed to indemnify us for any cost that might be incurred with those existing issues. As of the date of this report, we do not believe we will incur material costs in connection with any activities relating to these properties, but we cannot assure that this will be the case. If ACF fails to honor its obligations to us, we could be responsible for the cost of any additional investigation or remediation activities relating to these properties that may be required.
We believe that our operations and facilities are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
Future events, such as new environmental regulations or changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies, or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of products or business activities, may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition 
10

or results of operations. In addition, we have historically conducted investigation and remediation activities at properties that we own to address past contamination. To date, such costs have not been material. Although we believe we have satisfactorily addressed all known material contamination through our remediation activities, there can be no assurance that these activities have addressed all past contamination. The discovery of past contamination or the release of hazardous substances into the environment at our current or formerly owned or operated facilities could require us in the future to incur investigative or remedial costs or other liabilities that could be material or that could interfere with the operation of our businesses.
