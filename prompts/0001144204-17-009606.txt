Item 1. Business 
OVERVIEW 
 Midcoast Energy Partners, L.P. is a publicly-traded Delaware limited partnership formed in 2013 by Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P., or EEP, to serve as EEPs primary vehicle for owning and growing its natural gas and NGL midstream business in the United States. Midcoast Energy Partners, L.P., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, are referred to in this report as we, us, our, MEP, and the Partnership. As a pure-play U.S. natural gas and NGL midstream business, we are able to pursue a focused and flexible strategy and have the opportunity to grow through organic growth opportunities and acquisitions. Our Class A common units are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol MEP. 
 We own, directly or indirectly, a 51.6% limited partner interest in Midcoast Operating, L.P., or Midcoast Operating, a Texas limited partnership that owns a network of natural gas and NGL gathering and transportation systems, natural gas processing and treating facilities and NGL fractionation facilities primarily located in Texas and Oklahoma. We also own 100% of Midcoast Operatings general partner. Midcoast Operating also owns and operates natural gas, condensate and NGL logistics and marketing assets that primarily support its gathering, processing and transportation business. Through our ownership of Midcoast Operatings general partner, we control, manage and operate these systems. EEP owns a 48.4% noncontrolling interest in Midcoast Operating. Unless otherwise specifically noted, financial results and operating data are shown on a 100% basis. 
 Merger Agreement 
 We and our general partner entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of January 26, 2017 with EECI and Enbridge Holdings (Leather) L.L.C. pursuant to which EECI will acquire all of MEPs outstanding common units not already held by EECI, EEP or their affiliates (the Public Units). The holders of the Public Units will receive $8.00 in cash for each Public Unit. The Merger is expected to close in the second quarter of 2017, pending the satisfaction of certain customary conditions and the approval of the Merger by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding MEP common units (including the MEP common units held by EEP and its affiliates). Upon completion of the transaction, MEP will continue to exist as a limited partnership, but will no longer have publicly listed or traded units, nor will it be a reporting company under the SECs rules and regulations. For additional information on the Merger, refer to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1, Organization and Nature of Operations.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 The following chart shows our organization and ownership structure as of December 31, 2016. The ownership percentages set forth below illustrate the relationships among us, Midcoast Operating, our General Partner, EEP, Enbridge and its affiliates; such ownership interests may be held directly or indirectly: 

Our business primarily consists of gathering unprocessed and untreated natural gas from wellhead locations and other receipt points on our systems, processing the natural gas to remove NGLs and impurities at our processing and treating facilities and transporting the processed natural gas and NGLs to intrastate and interstate pipelines for transportation to various customers and market outlets. In addition we also provide marketing services of natural gas and NGLs to wholesale customers.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 We seek to provide our customers with quality field-level service and responsiveness using our strong platform of natural gas and NGL infrastructure. We are able to provide our customers with integrated wellhead-to-market service from our systems to major energy market hubs in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent regions of the United States. From these market hubs, natural gas and NGLs are either consumed in local markets or transported to consumers in the midwest, northeast and southeast United States. 
BUSINESS STRATEGY 
 We have historically sought to increase the amount of cash distributions we make to our unitholders over time while maintaining our focus on safety and stability in our business. We pursued this objective through, among other things, the following business strategies: 

1. | Delivering our services safely and reliably
---+--------------------------------------------

 We are committed to maintaining and continually improving the safety, reliability and efficiency of our operations, which we believe is key to attracting new customers and maintaining relationships with our current customers, regulators and the communities in which we operate. We strive for operational excellence by utilizing robust programs to integrate environmental integrity, health and occupational safety and risk management principles throughout our business. We employ comprehensive integrity management, inspection, monitoring and audit initiatives in support of this strategy. 
 
2. | Enhancing the profitability of our existing assets
---+---------------------------------------------------

 To address the continuing producer focus on the liquids portion of the midstream natural gas value chain, we expect to further optimize our natural gas processing capacity, NGL takeaway capacity options, and our third-party fractionation alternatives, which we believe will, over the long-term, increase the attractiveness and profitability of our natural gas and NGL systems, attract new customers and increase our business with existing customers. We seek to capitalize on opportunities to attract new customers, increase volumes of natural gas and NGLs that we gather, process or treat, transport and otherwise enhance utilization and operating efficiencies, including increasing customer access to preferred natural gas and NGL markets. We are committed to increase our percentage of fee-based contracts to reduce commodity exposure and further strengthen our profitability. We believe our approach provides our customers with greater value for their commodities and increases the utilization of our natural gas and NGL systems. 
 
3. | Maintaining a conservative and flexible capital structure
---+----------------------------------------------------------

 We intend to finance long-term growth projects and acquisitions primarily through our credit facility and in the longer term through term debt and equity. Over the longer term, we are seeking a balanced combination of debt and equity that we believe will promote the long-term stability of our business. 
 
4. | Pursuing economically attractive organic growth opportunities
---+--------------------------------------------------------------

 We seek out attractive organic expansion and asset enhancement opportunities that leverage our existing asset footprint, strategic relationships with our customers and our expertise in constructing, developing and optimizing midstream infrastructure assets. The organic development projects we pursue are designed to extend our geographic reach, diversify our customer base, expand our gathering systems and our processing and treating capacity, enhance end-market access and maximize throughput volumes. For more information relating to growth opportunities refer to Business Segments.

5. | Pursuing accretive acquisitions from third parties
---+---------------------------------------------------

 We intend to pursue accretive acquisitions from third parties that complement or diversify our existing operations, if and when market conditions improve. 
 While the Merger will result in our no longer having publicly traded units, we will continue to work with EEP to explore and evaluate strategic alternatives in addition to, or as alternatives to, our historical business strategies. EEP has also indicated that it is reviewing strategic alternatives with respect to its investment in us and Midcoast Operating.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 BUSINESS SEGMENTS 
 We conduct our business through two distinct reporting segments: Gathering, Processing and Transportation and Logistics and Marketing. 
 These segments have unique business activities that require different operating strategies. For information relating to revenues from third-party customers, operating income and total assets for each segment, refer to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 5. Segment Information. 
 Gathering, Processing and Transportation 
 Our gathering, processing and transportation business includes natural gas and NGL gathering and transportation pipeline systems, natural gas processing and treating facilities, condensate stabilizers and an NGL fractionation facility. We gather natural gas from the wellhead and central receipt points on our systems, deliver it to our facilities for processing and treating and deliver the residue gas to intrastate or interstate pipelines for transmission to wholesale customers such as power plants, industrial customers and local distribution companies. We deliver the NGLs produced at our processing and fractionation facilities to intrastate and interstate pipelines for transportation to the NGL market hubs in Mont Belvieu, Texas and Conway, Kansas. In addition, we deliver NGLs from certain of our facilities to the Texas Express NGL system for transportation on the Texas Express NGL mainline to Mont Belvieu, Texas. 
 The following table provides selected information regarding our natural gas and NGL systems in our gathering, processing and transportation business at December 31, 2016: 


 | Natural gas gathering and transportation pipelines (length in miles) | | NGL pipelines (length in miles)(4) | Number of active natural gas processing plants | | Number of standby natural gas processing plants | Number of active natural gas treating plants | | Number of standby natural gas treating plants

(3) | Consists of approximately 593-mile NGL intrastate transportation mainline and a related NGL gathering system that consists of approximately 116 miles of gathering lines.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anadarko System 
 Our Anadarko system includes production from the Granite Wash tight sand formation. Productive horizons in the Granite Wash play include the Hogshooter, Checkerboard, Cleveland, Skinner, Red Fork, Atoka and Morrow formations. Recent decreases in NGL and condensate prices have resulted in decreased activity in the region. The Anadarko basin wells generally have long lives with predictable flow rates. Producers generally pursue wells with higher condensate and oil production relative to historical activity that was focused on natural gas and NGL prospects. 
 With recent commodity prices in decline resulting in reduced production, we have idled approximately seven of our less efficient processing plants and consolidated volumes to our more efficient plants. These plants are available for restart when production increases. 
 Our Anadarko system has numerous market outlets for the natural gas that we gather and process and NGLs and condensate that we recover on our system. We have connections to major intrastate and interstate transportation pipelines that connect our facilities to major market hubs in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions of the United States. All of our owned residue gas and condensate is sold to our logistics and marketing business. The majority of our owned NGLs are also sold to our logistics and marketing business with the remainder being sold directly to a third-party. The NGLs produced at our Anadarko system processing plants are transported by pipeline to third-party fractionation facilities and NGL market hubs in Conway, Kansas and Mont Belvieu, Texas.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 East Texas System 
 Our East Texas system gathers production from: the Cotton Valley, James Lime and lean Bossier Shale plays, which are located on the western side of our East Texas system; the Haynesville/Bossier Shale plays, which run from western Louisiana into East Texas and are among the largest natural gas resources in the United States; and the Cotton Valley Sand formation, which also runs from western Louisiana into East Texas and has a high content of NGLs and condensate on the eastern side of our East Texas system. The East Texas basin also includes multiple other natural gas and oil formations that are frequently explored, including among others, the Woodbine, Travis Peak, Rodessa, and Pettite. The East Texas wells generally have long lives with predictable flow rates. 
 In May 2015, we placed into service a cryogenic natural gas processing plant near Beckville in Panola County, Texas, which we refer to as the Beckville Processing Plant. This plant serves existing and prospective customers pursuing production in the Cotton Valley formation, which is comprised of approximately ten counties in East Texas. Our Beckville processing plant is capable of processing approximately 150 MMcf/d of natural gas and producing approximately 8,500 Bpd of NGLs to accommodate the additional liquids-rich natural gas within this geographical area in which our East Texas system operates. Related NGL takeaway infrastructure connecting the Beckville plant to third-party NGL transportation systems was also constructed. In 2016, our processing plants in East Texas were near or at full capacity. 
 Our East Texas system has numerous market outlets for the natural gas that we gather and process and NGLs and condensate that we recover on our system. We have connections to major intrastate and interstate transportation pipelines that connect our facilities to major market hubs in the United States Gulf Coast, as well as to several wholesale customers. The majority of our owned residue gas is sold to our logistics and marketing business, while the remainder of our owned residue gas is sold directly to third-party wholesale customers or utilities. Our owned condensate is also sold to our logistics and marketing business. A portion of the NGLs produced at one of our East Texas system processing plants is fractionated by us and sold directly to a third-party chemical company. The remainder of the NGLs recovered at our plants are sold to our logistics and marketing business and transported by pipeline to Mont Belvieu, Texas for fractionation. 
 North Texas System 
 A substantial portion of natural gas on our North Texas system is produced in the Barnett Shale play within the Fort Worth basin. The North Texas wells are located in the Fort Worth basin and generally have long lives with predictable flow rates. As producers have shifted to more economic advantaged basins, we have seen our natural gas volumes decline in the basin. 
 Our North Texas system has numerous market outlets for the natural gas that we gather and process and NGLs that we recover on our system. We have connections to major intrastate transportation pipelines that connect our facilities to market centers in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. All of our owned condensate and NGLs produced at our North Texas system processing plants are sold to our logistics and marketing business. The majority of our owned residue gas is also sold to our logistics and marketing business. 
 Texas Express NGL System 
 We own a 35% interest in two joint ventures that together comprise the Texas Express NGL system. The Texas Express NGL system consists of an NGL gathering system and an NGL intrastate mainline transportation pipeline that originates in Skellytown, Texas, and extends to NGL fractionation and storage facilities located in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Volumes from the Rockies, Permian basin and Mid-Continent regions are delivered to the Texas Express NGL system utilizing the Mid-America Pipeline between the Conway hub and the Hobbs NGL fractionation facility in West Texas, both of which are owned by a third party. In addition, volumes from the Denver-Julesburg basin in Weld County, Colorado can access the system through the Front Range Pipeline, which is owned by third parties. 
 Customers.  Our gathering, processing and transportation business serves customers predominantly in the Gulf Coast region of the United States and includes both upstream customers and purchasers of natural gas and NGLs. Upstream customers served by our systems primarily consist of small, medium and large independent operators and large integrated energy companies, while our natural gas customers primarily consist of large users of natural gas, such as power plants, industrial facilities, local distribution companies and other large consumers. Our condensate and NGLs are marketed to chemical facilities, refiners, various third parties and end users. Due to the cost of making physical connections from the wellhead to gathering systems, the majority of our customers tend to renew their gathering and processing contracts with us rather than seeking alternative gathering and processing services.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Supply and Demand.  Demand for our gathering, processing and transportation services primarily depends upon the supply of natural gas reserves and associated natural gas from crude oil development and the drilling rate for new wells. The level of impurities in the natural gas gathered also affects treating services. All of our gathering, processing and transportation systems exist in regions that have shale or tight sands formations where hydraulic fracturing technology can be utilized to increase production from the natural gas wells. Demand for these services depends upon overall economic conditions, drilling activity and the prices of natural gas, NGLs, and condensates. Commodity prices for natural gas, NGLs, and condensates remained low throughout 2016. As a result, there has been reduction in drilling activity by producers and reduced volumes on the systems we operate. Our existing systems are located in basins that have the opportunity to grow in an improved pricing environment. 
 Competition.  Competition in our gathering, processing and transportation business is significant in all of the markets we serve. Competitors include interstate and intrastate pipelines or their affiliates and other midstream businesses that gather, treat, process and market natural gas or NGLs. Our gathering businesss principal competitors are other midstream companies and, to a lesser extent, producer-owned gathering systems. Some of these competitors are substantially larger than we are. Because pipelines are generally the only practical mode of transportation for natural gas over land, the most significant competitors of our natural gas pipelines are other pipeline companies. Pipelines typically compete with each other based on location, capacity, reputation, price and reliability. 
 Competition for the services we provide varies based upon the location of gathering, treating and processing facilities. Most upstream customers have alternate gathering, treating and processing facilities available to them. In addition, they have alternatives such as building their own gathering facilities or, in some cases, selling their natural gas supplies without treating and processing. On sour natural gas systems, such as parts of our East Texas system, competition is more limited in certain locations due to the infrastructure required to treat sour natural gas. Many of the large wholesale customers we serve have multiple pipelines connected or adjacent to their facilities. Accordingly, many of these customers have the ability to purchase natural gas directly from a number of pipelines or third parties that may hold capacity on the various pipelines. In addition, several new interstate natural gas pipelines have been constructed in areas currently served by our natural gas transportation pipelines. Some of these new pipelines may compete for customers with our existing pipelines. 
 Logistics and Marketing 
 The primary role of our logistics and marketing business is to provide marketing services of natural gas, NGLs and condensate received from our gathering, processing and transportation business. We purchase and receive natural gas, NGLs and other products from pipeline systems and processing plants and sell and deliver them to wholesale customers, such as distributors, refiners, fractionators, chemical facilities, various third parties and end users. Our Logistics and Marketing segment derives a majority of its operating income from selling natural gas, NGLs and condensate received from producers on our Gathering, Processing and Transportation segment pipeline assets. A majority of the natural gas and NGLs we purchase are produced in Texas markets where we have intrastate deliverability alternatives over the past several years. We use our connectivity to interstate pipelines to improve value for the producers by delivering natural gas into premium markets and NGLs to primary markets where we sell them to major customers. Additionally, our Logistics and Marketing segment derives operating income from providing logistics services for our customers from the wellhead to markets. 
 On September 1, 2015, two wholly-owned subsidiaries of Midcoast Operating in the Logistics and Marketing segment sold certain natural gas inventories and assigned certain storage agreements, transportation contracts and other arrangements to a third party. From that date through October 2016, Midcoast Operating subsidiaries sold their natural gas products directly to third parties instead of a portion through the Logistics and Marketing segment. The arrangement for Midcoast Operating subsidiaries to sell natural gas products directly to third parties expired on October 31, 2016. Since that date, Midcoast Operating subsidiaries have sold their natural gas products to third parties through the Logistics and Marketing segment. 
 On August 15, 2016, our logistics and marketing business sold its transport trucks and trailers (alternatively our trucking business) to a third party. In conjunction with the sale, our logistics and marketing business entered into a long-term trucking services agreement with the purchaser, insuring no interruption of our logistics activities.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 As of December 31, 2016, the physical assets of our logistics and marketing business primarily consist of:
 
 | Approximately 190 railcars for transporting NGLs;
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | Our TexPan liquids railcar facility near Pampa, Texas; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | Our Petal truck & rail facility near Hattiesburg, Mississippi.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 We also enter into agreements with various third parties to obtain natural gas and NGL supply, transportation, gas balancing, fractionation and storage capacity in support of the logistics and marketing services we provide to our gathering, processing and transportation business and to third-party customers. These agreements provide our logistics and marketing business with the following:
 
 | up to approximately 79,000 Bpd through 2022 of firm NGL fractionation capacity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | up to approximately 75,000 Bpd on average in 2017 to 120,000 Bpd in 2022 of firm NGL transportation capacity on the Texas Express NGL system;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | up to approximately 39,000 Bpd through 2022 of additional firm NGL transportation capacity on third-party pipelines;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | up to approximately 42,555 Bpd through April 2017 and 8,500 Bpd continuing May 2017 through March 2019 of NGL capacity via exchange agreements with various counterparties; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | approximately 5.0 million barrels of liquids, or MMBbls, of NGL storage capacity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Customers.  Our logistics and marketing business purchases and receives natural gas, NGLs and other products from our gathering, processing and transportation business as well as from third-party pipeline systems and processing plants and sells and delivers them to third-party customers. Most of the third-party customers of our logistics and marketing operations are wholesale customers, refiners and petrochemical producers, fractionators, propane distributors and industrial, utility and power plant customers. In addition, we sell natural gas and NGLs to marketing companies at various market hubs. 
 Supply and Demand.  Supply for our logistics and marketing business depends to a large extent on the natural gas reserves, associated natural gas from crude oil development, and rate of drilling within the areas served by our gathering, processing and transportation business. Demand is typically driven by a number of factors such as physical domestic and international industrial requirements. 
 Since major market hubs for natural gas and NGLs and related products are located in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions of the United States and our logistics and marketing business assets are geographically located within Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Kansas and Mississippi, the majority of activities conducted by our logistics and marketing business are conducted within those states. Our interconnected gathering and transportation systems and our long-term trucking and railcar arrangements mitigate the risk that our natural gas and NGLs will be shut in by capacity constraints on downstream NGL pipelines and other facilities. 
 One of the key components of our logistics and marketing business is our natural gas and NGL purchase and resale activities. Through our natural gas and NGL purchase and resale services, we can efficiently manage the transportation and delivery of natural gas from our gathering, processing and transportation assets and deliver them to on-system industrial customers, and NGLs to marketing companies at various market hubs. We typically price our sales based on multiple published daily or monthly price indices. In addition, sales to wholesale customers include a pass-through charge for costs of transportation and additional margin to compensate us for the associated services we provide. 
 Our NGL logistics and marketing business also uses third-party storage facilities for the right to store NGLs for various periods of time to mitigate risk associated with sales and purchase contracts. We have also entered into multiple long-term fractionation contracts with third-party fractionators to provide access to fractionation capacity for our customers. 
 Competition.  Our logistics and marketing business has numerous competitors, including large natural gas and NGL marketing companies, marketing affiliates of pipelines, major oil, natural gas and NGL producers, trucking, railcar and pipeline operations, independent aggregators and regional marketing companies. Our logistics and marketing business principal competitors include numerous natural gas and NGL marketing companies and major integrated oil and natural gas companies.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Seasonality 
 The drilling activities of producers within our areas of operations generally do not vary materially by season but may be affected by adverse weather. Generally, the demand for natural gas and NGLs decreases during the spring and fall months and increases during the winter months and, in some areas, during the summer months. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers can lessen or intensify this fluctuation. Demand for natural gas with respect to power plant customers is typically driven by weather-related factors. 
REGULATION 
 Regulation of Intrastate Natural Gas Pipelines 
 Our operations in Texas are subject to regulation under the Texas Utilities Code and the Texas Natural Resources Code, as implemented by the Texas Railroad Commission, or TRRC. Generally, the TRRC is vested with authority to ensure that rates charged for natural gas sales and transportation services are just and reasonable. The rates we charge for transportation services are deemed just and reasonable under Texas law, unless challenged in a complaint. We cannot predict whether such a complaint may be filed against us or whether the TRRC will change its method of regulating rates. Pursuant to authority granted to it by the Texas Natural Resources Code, the TRRC has adopted by rule an Informal Complaint Process that applies to rate issues associated with gathering or transmission systems, thus subjecting gathering and intrastate pipeline activities of Enbridge to the jurisdiction of the TRRC. 
 In Oklahoma, intrastate natural gas pipelines and gathering systems are subject to regulation by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, or OCC. Specifically, the OCC is vested with the authority to prescribe and enforce maximum rates for the transportation and transmission of natural gas. These rates may be amended or altered at any time by the OCC. However, a company affected by a rate change will be given at least ten days notice in order to introduce evidence of opposition to such amendment. Adjustment of claims or settlement of controversies regarding rates between transportation and transmission companies and customers will be mediated by the OCC prior to any hearing on the dispute, upon request. An entity operating an intrastate natural gas pipeline or gathering system in Oklahoma is subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC, and failure to comply with an OCC order regarding rate requirements could result in contempt proceedings instituted before the OCC by any affected party. 
 Regulation by the FERC of Intrastate Natural Gas Pipelines 
 Our Texas and Oklahoma intrastate pipelines are generally not subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. However, to the extent our intrastate pipelines transport natural gas in interstate commerce, the rates, terms and conditions of such transportation are subject to FERC jurisdiction under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act, or NGPA. In addition, under FERC regulations we are subject to market manipulation and transparency rules. This includes the annual reporting requirements pursuant to FERC Order No. 735 et al. Failure to comply with the FERCs rules, regulations and orders can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties. 
 Natural Gas Gathering Regulation 
 Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or NGA, exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the FERC. We own certain natural gas facilities that we believe meet traditional tests the FERC has used to establish a facilitys status as a gatherer not subject to FERC jurisdiction. However, to the extent our gathering systems buy and sell natural gas that is processed or that can be sold into the market without being processed, such gatherers, in their capacity as buyers and sellers of natural gas, are subject to certain reporting requirements resulting from the FERC Order 704 series. 
 State regulations of gathering facilities typically address the safety and environmental concerns involved in the design, construction, installation, testing and operation of gathering facilities. In addition, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory requirements are also addressed; however, state regulators have not historically taken an active role in setting or reviewing rates for gathering facilities absent a shipper protest. Many of the producing states have previously adopted some form of complaint-based regulation that generally allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to natural gas gathering access or perceived rate discrimination. Our gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to significant and unduly burdensome state or federal regulation of rates and services.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 NGL Pipeline Regulation 
 The mainline and gathering portions of the Texas Express NGL system are common carriers subject to regulation by various federal agencies and/or the TRRC. The FERC regulates the interstate pipeline transportation of crude oil, petroleum products, and other liquids such as NGLs, collectively called petroleum pipelines. The FERC regulates these operations pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act, or ICA, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992, or EP Act of 1992. The ICA and its implementing regulations require that tariff rates for interstate service on petroleum pipelines be just and reasonable and must not be unduly discriminatory or confer undue preference on any shipper. 
 The EP Act of 1992 required the FERC to establish a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for interstate petroleum pipelines. As a result, the FERC adopted an indexed rate methodology. If the rate levels on Texas Express NGL system were subject to formal review or challenge before the FERC, the Texas Express NGL system would be required to produce a traditional cost of service review justifying its revenues or demonstrate it lacks significant market power. 
 Two of our other NGL lines, which do not provide service to third parties, operate under FERC-granted waivers from the reporting requirements of Sections 6 and 20 of the ICA. These waivers are effective until a third party shipper requests service. In addition, certain of our NGL lines are subject to regulation as a common carrier by the TRRC. The TRRCs jurisdiction extends to both rates and pipeline safety. The rates we charge for NGL transportation service are deemed just and reasonable under Texas law unless challenged by a complaint. Complaints to state agencies remain infrequent and are usually informally resolved, but ongoing industry practices might indicate an increase in complaints and TRRC oversight. Although we cannot assure that our intrastate rates would ultimately be upheld if challenged, we believe that, given this history, the tariffs now in effect are not likely to be challenged or, if challenged, are not likely to be ordered to be reduced. 
 Sales of Natural Gas, Condensate and Natural Gas Liquids 
 The price at which we sell natural gas currently is not subject to federal or state regulation except for certain systems in Texas. Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of pipeline transportation. As noted above, the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. The FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry, most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies that remain subject to the FERCs jurisdiction. These initiatives also may affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas under certain circumstances. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and to facilitate price transparency in markets for the wholesale sale of physical natural gas. 
 Our sales of condensate and NGLs currently are not regulated and are made at market prices. In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to the FERCs or TRRCs jurisdiction. Regulations implemented by the FERC or TRRC could increase the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum products pipelines, however, we do not believe that these regulations will affect us any differently than other marketers of these products transporting on regulated pipelines. 
 Safety and Environmental Regulation 
 General 
 Our transmission and gathering pipelines, storage and processing facilities, and railcar operations are subject to extensive environmental, operational and safety regulation at federal and state levels. The added costs imposed by regulations are generally no different than those imposed on our competitors. Failure to comply with such standards and regulations can result in substantial penalties and/or enforcement actions and added operational costs. 
Pipeline Safety and Transportation Regulation 
 Some of our natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, or NGPSA, and the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, or PSIA, as reauthorized and amended by the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006, or the PIPES Act. The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of natural gas pipeline facilities, while the PSIA establishes mandatory

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 inspections for all U.S. oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in high-consequence areas, or HCAs. HCAs are defined as those areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage, that cross a navigable waterway, or that have a high population density. In the PIPES Act, Congress required mandatory inspections for certain U.S. crude oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in HCAs and mandated that regulations be issued for low-stress hazardous liquid pipelines and pipeline control room management. 
 Our NGL pipelines are subject to regulation by PHMSA under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, or the HLPSA, and the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992, or the PSA. The HLPSA requires PHMSA to develop, prescribe, and enforce minimum federal safety standards for the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline. The PSA added the environment to the list of statutory factors that must be considered in establishing safety standards for hazardous liquid pipelines, established safety standards for certain regulated gathering lines, and mandated that regulations be issued to establish criteria for operators to use in identifying and inspecting pipelines located in HCAs. 
 Our pipelines are also subject to the Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act of 1996, or the APSA, which limited the operator identification requirement to operators of pipelines that cross a waterway where a substantial likelihood of commercial navigation exists, required that certain areas where a pipeline rupture would likely cause permanent or long-term environmental damage be considered in determining whether an area is unusually sensitive to environmental damage, and mandated that regulations be issued for the qualification and testing of certain pipeline personnel. 
 PHMSA has developed regulations that require pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in HCAs. The regulations require operators, including us, to:
 
 | perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;
--+---------------------------------------------------


 | identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a HCA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Although many of our pipeline facilities are not classified as transmission pipelines and currently are not subject to these requirements, we may incur significant costs and liabilities associated with repair, remediation, preventative or mitigation measures associated with our transmission pipelines on an annual basis as required by existing United States Department of Transportation, or DOT, regulations and their state counterparts. Such costs and liabilities might relate to repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program, as well as lost cash flows resulting from shutting down our pipelines during the pendency of such repairs. Additionally, should we fail to comply with DOT or comparable state regulations, we could be subject to penalties and fines. If future DOT pipeline integrity management regulations were to require that we expand our integrity management program to currently unregulated pipelines, including gathering lines, costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on our operations. 
 The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011, or the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, reauthorizes funding for federal pipeline safety programs, increases penalties for safety violations, establishes additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines, and requires studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, among other things, increases the maximum civil penalty for pipeline safety violations and directs the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate rules or standards relating to expanded integrity management requirements, automatic or remote-controlled valve use, excess flow valve use, leak detection system installation and testing to confirm the material strength of pipe operating above 30% of specified minimum yield strength in HCAs. 
 The PHMSA finalized a rule increasing the maximum administrative civil penalties for violation of the pipeline safety laws and regulations after January 3, 2012 to $200,000 per violation per day, with a maximum of $2,000,000 for a related series of violations. The PHMSA also issued a final rule applying safety regulations to certain rural low-stress hazardous liquid pipelines that were not covered previously by some of its safety regulations. The PHMSA has also published advanced notice of proposed rulemakings to solicit comments on the need for changes to its natural gas and liquid pipeline safety regulations, including whether to revise the integrity management

 requirements and add new regulations governing the safety of gathering lines. The PHMSA also has published an advisory bulletin providing guidance on verification of records related to pipeline maximum allowable operating pressure. We have performed hydrostatic tests of our facilities to confirm the maximum allowable operating pressure and do not expect that any final rulemaking by PHMSA regarding verification of maximum allowable operating pressure would materially affect our operations or revenue. 
 The National Transportation Safety Board has recommended that the PHMSA make a number of changes to its rules, including removing an exemption from most safety inspections for natural gas pipelines installed before 1970. While we cannot predict the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives, such legislative and regulatory changes could have a material effect on our operations, particularly by extending through more stringent and comprehensive safety regulations (such as integrity management requirements) to pipelines and gathering lines not previously subject to such requirements. While we expect any legislative or regulatory changes to allow us time to become compliant with new requirements, costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on our operations. 
 States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate lines but most are certified by the DOT to assume responsibility for enforcing federal intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. States may adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate lines; however, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. State standards may include requirements for facility design and management in addition to requirements for pipelines. We do not anticipate any significant difficulty in complying with applicable state laws and regulations. Our natural gas pipelines have continuous inspection and compliance programs designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety and pollution control requirements. 
 We have incorporated all existing requirements into our programs by the required regulatory deadlines, and are continually incorporating the new requirements into procedures and budgets. We expect to incur increasing regulatory compliance costs, based on the intensification of the regulatory environment and upcoming changes to regulations as outlined above. In addition to regulatory changes, costs may be incurred when there is an accidental release of a commodity transported by our system, or a regulatory inspection identifies a deficiency in our required programs. 
 When hydrocarbons are released into the environment or violations identified during an inspection, PHMSA may issue a civil penalty or enforcement action, which can require internal inspections, pipeline pressure reductions and other methods to manage or verify the integrity of a pipeline in the affected area. In addition, the National Transportation Safety Board may perform an investigation of a significant accident to determine the probable cause and issue safety recommendations to prevent future accidents. 
 We believe that our pipeline and railcar operations are in substantial compliance with applicable operational and safety requirements. In instances of non-compliance, we have taken actions to remediate the situations. Nevertheless, significant operating expenses and capital expenditure could be incurred in the future if additional safety measures are required or if safety standards are raised and exceed the capabilities of our current pipeline control system or other safety equipment. 
 Environmental Regulation 
 General.  Our operations are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of health and the environment, including laws and regulations that govern the handling, storage, treating and processing of liquid hydrocarbon materials or emissions from natural gas processing, treating or compression facilities. As with the pipeline and processing industry in general, complying with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of doing business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities. While these laws and regulations affect our maintenance capital expenditures and net income, we believe that they do not affect our competitive position since the operations of our competitors are generally similarly affected. 
 In addition to compliance costs, violations of environmental laws or regulations can result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties and, in some instances, injunctions, banning or delaying certain activities. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. 
 There are also risks of accidental releases into the environment associated with our operations, such as releases or spills of crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas or other substances from our pipelines or facilities. Such accidental releases could, to the extent not insured, subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental

 cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines, penalties or damages for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. 
 Although we are entitled, in certain circumstances, to indemnification from third parties for environmental liabilities relating to assets we acquired from those parties, these contractual indemnification rights are limited, and accordingly, we may be required to bear substantial environmental expenses. However, we believe that through our due diligence process, we identify and manage substantial issues. 
 Air and Water Emissions.  Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, or CAA, and the Clean Water Act, or CWA, and comparable promulgated state and local statutes. We anticipate, therefore, that we will incur costs in the next several years for air pollution control equipment and spill prevention measures in connection with maintaining existing facilities, designing future compliant facilities and obtaining permit approvals for any new or acquired facilities. Our facilities subject to criteria air emission inventories have reported that they are in compliance with state mandated timelines. The operations of our compressor and plant facilities subject to the Environmental Protection Agencys, or EPA, Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures Rule are currently in full compliance. Our facilities subject to existing EPA Part 98 Subpart C and W Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, or GHGRP, rules have reported emissions prior to the annual filing deadlines. 
 On October 31, 2016, the EPA finalized rule revisions, Subpart JJJJ, in the Code of Federal Regulations, or CFR, relating to test methods and performance specifications impacting facilities with stationary spark ignition internal combustion engines. 
 On September 18, 2015, the EPA published a proposed rule, Subpart OOOOa, which would update the original 2012 standard to include additional reductions in methane and VOCs in the oil and gas industry. On June 3, 2016, EPA published NSPS OOOOa in the Federal Register which includes seven areas of applicability for previously unaffected sources. On July 15, 2016 fifteen states filed suit in the District of Columbia Circuit Court objecting the rule. The current compliance date for OOOOa is June 2017. 
 On October 22, 2015, the EPA responded to a petition made by the Environmental Integrity Project to include the oil and gas extraction industrial sector in the scope of covered sectors of Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, commonly known as the Toxic Release Inventory, or TRI. EPA has currently indicated oil and gas extraction is not included in the TRI reporting screening program. 
 On October 22, 2015, the EPA finalized amendments to GHGRP to include natural gas gathering and boosting systems, well completions, and blowdown emissions associated with transmission pipelines. The rule effective date for data collection was January 1, 2016 and reporting begins for calendar year 2017 for applicable facilities. 
 The EPA has issued the Oil and Gas Information Request, or ICR, scoped to the oil and gas industry. MEP received notification of ICR on November 22, 2016 in which EPA will ask the oil and gas industry members to provide extensive information for EPA to develop regulations to further reduce methane and VOC emissions. EPA responses are due 180 days from receipt of the mailed ICR document. 
 On June 29, 2015, the EPA published the Clean Water Rule: Definition of Waters of the United States. The new rule is intended to clarify what is considered Waters of the United States, or WOTUS, with respect to discharges of pollutants to the covered water. The Oil Pollution Act, or OPA, was enacted in 1990 and amends parts of the CWA and other statutes as they pertain to the prevention of and response to oil spills. Under the OPA, we could be subject to strict, joint and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and other consequences of an oil spill from our facilities into navigable waters, along shorelines or in an exclusive economic zone of the United States. The OPA also imposes certain spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements for many of our non-pipeline facilities, such as the preparation of detailed oil spill emergency response plans and the construction of dikes or other containment structures to prevent contamination of navigable or other waters in the event of an oil overflow, rupture or release. For our liquid pipeline facilities, the OPA imposes requirements for emergency plans to be prepared, submitted and approved by the DOT. For our non-transportation facilities, such as storage tanks that are not integral to our pipeline transportation system, the OPA regulations are promulgated by the EPA. We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations. 
 For all proposed rules, we will continue to track the progress through involvement in industry groups and will comply with regulatory requirements. We do not expect a material effect on our financial statements as a result of compliance efforts.

 Hazardous Substances and Waste Management.  The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA (also known as the Superfund law) and similar state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons, including the owners or operators of waste disposal sites and companies that disposed or arranged for disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites. We may generate some wastes that fall within the definition of a hazardous substance. We may, therefore, be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of any costs required to clean up and restore sites at which such wastes have been disposed. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. Analogous state laws may apply to a broader range of substances than CERCLA and, in some instances, may offer fewer exemptions from liability. We have not received any notification that we may be potentially responsible for material cleanup costs under CERCLA or similar state laws. 
 Site Remediation.  We own and operate a number of pipelines, gathering systems, storage facilities and processing facilities that have been used to transport, distribute, store and process natural gas and other petroleum products. Many of our facilities were previously owned and operated by third parties whose handling, disposal and release of petroleum and waste materials were not under our control. The age of the facilities, combined with the past operating and waste disposal practices, which were standard for the industry and regulatory regime at the time, have resulted in soil and groundwater contamination at some facilities due to historical spills and releases. Such contamination is not unusual within the natural gas and petroleum industry. Historical contamination found on, under or originating from our properties may be subject to CERCLA, the Resource Conservation & Recovery Act and analogous state laws as described above. 
 Under these laws, we could incur substantial expense to remediate such contamination, including contamination caused by prior owners and operators. In addition, our General Partner could also be liable for such costs to the extent that we are unable to fulfill our obligations. We have conducted site investigations at some of our facilities to assess historical environmental issues, and we are currently addressing soil and groundwater contamination at various facilities through remediation and monitoring programs, with oversight by the applicable governmental agencies where appropriate. 
 EMPLOYEES 
 We are managed and operated by the board of directors and executive officers of our General Partner. Neither we nor our subsidiaries have any employees. Affiliates of our General Partner provide the employees and other personnel necessary to conduct our operations. We believe that our General Partner and its affiliates have a satisfactory relationship with those employees. 
INSURANCE 
 Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the midstream industry. Our assets may experience physical damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster. These hazards can also cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, and suspension of operations. We are insured under the comprehensive insurance program that is maintained by Enbridge for its subsidiaries. The policy includes commercial liability insurance coverage that is consistent with coverage considered customary for our industry and has a renewal date of May 1, 2017. The insurance coverage also includes property insurance coverage on our assets that includes earnings interruption resulting from an insurable event, except for pipeline assets that are not located at water crossings. In the unlikely event multiple insurable incidents occur which exceed coverage limits within the same insurance period, the total insurance coverage will be allocated among the Enbridge entities on an equitable basis based on an insurance allocation agreement we have entered into with EEP, Enbridge and other Enbridge subsidiaries. 
 The insurance policy coverage limits and deductible amounts at December 31, 2016, for Enbridge, Inc. and its subsidiaries are: 


Insurance Type | Coverage Limits | | Deductible Amount
 | (in millions) 
Property and business interruption | | Up to $650.0 | | $ | 10.0
General liability | | Up to $900.0 | | $ | 0.1 
Pollution liability (as included under General Liability) | | Up to $900.0 | | $ | 30.0

 We can make no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain will be available or adequate for any particular risk or loss or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. Although we believe that our assets are adequately covered by insurance, a substantial uninsured loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
TAXATION 
 We are not a taxable entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Generally, U.S. federal and state income taxes on our taxable income are borne by our individual partners through the allocation of our taxable income. In a limited number of states, an income tax is imposed upon us and generally, not our individual partners. The income tax that we bear is reflected in our consolidated financial statements. The allocation of taxable income to our individual partners may vary substantially from net income reported in our consolidated statements of income. 
AVAILABLE INFORMATION 
 We make available free of charge on or through our Internet website http://www.midcoastpartners.com our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other information statements, and if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with the SEC. Information contained on our website is not part of this report.
