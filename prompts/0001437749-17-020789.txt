Item 1.            BUSINESS. 
 
As used in this Report (unless the context otherwise requires) “Learning Tree”, “we”, “our”, the “Company”, and “us” refer to Learning Tree International, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 
Overview 
 
Learning Tree International, Inc. is a leading worldwide provider to business and government organizations for the training and workforce development of their information technology (“IT”) professionals and managers. Since our founding in 1974, we have provided high-quality, predominantly vendor independent training to more than 2.5 million IT professionals and managers. In fiscal year 2017, while presenting courses in 39 countries, we trained 53,170 course participants from approximately 4,700 organizations, including large national and multinational companies, government organizations, and small and medium-size companies. 
 
We offer a broad library of intensive, instructor-led courses from one to five days in length, which at September 29, 2017 comprised 318 different course titles representing 5,889 hours of training, including 159 multi-day IT course titles, 76 multi-day management course titles, and 83 one-day course titles. Learning Tree courses provide education and training across a wide range of technical and management disciplines, including operating systems, databases, computer networks, cyber and network security, web development, programming languages, software engineering, open source applications, project management, business skills, leadership and professional development. We use a well-defined systematic approach to develop and update the Learning Tree course library so as to provide training that is immediately applicable by course participants to their work in a broad range of applications and industries. After assessing market need, courses may be translated into Swedish and Japanese. Our proprietary course development process enables us to efficiently and effectively customize our course content to specific customer requirements for delivery at customer sites.
 
We also partner with other organizations to broaden the breadth of training that we offer to our customers, with the objective of enabling us to meet an organization’s complete workforce needs. In terms of vendor partners, we reached agreement with Microsoft to become a Microsoft approved training partner, and we now offer Microsoft approved courses. This also allows us to accept Microsoft training vouchers and eliminates the need for us to maintain duplicate course content which has allowed us to retire the majority of our self-developed Microsoft courses. We have also begun offering our customers the ability to take courses we do not have in our course library from approved “Partner” providers. Through these “Partner” providers, we are able to offer courses in a number of different vendor technologies and products, including Cisco, Adobe, IBM, Red Hat, VMware, Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto Networks, and Amazon Web Services. In addition to our partnering strategy, we also recently announced that we will be making certain select proprietary Learning Tree course content available for use under a license agreement through third party resellers.  This is an additional approach to recognize value from our significant proprietary course content library.
 
We are also working more closely with a number of certification and accreditation organizations to offer training programs for IT professionals seeking to earn such certifications. We are a continuing professional education (CPE) provider of the International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium. In addition, we are on the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy National Registry of CPE sponsors; a Registered Education Provider of the Project Management Institute; an APMG International Accredited Training Organization; an International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA) Endorsed Education Provider; an AXELOS Global Best Practice Strategic Partner; a GCHQ Certified Cyber Security Training Provider; a British Computing Society (BCS) Accredited Training Organization; and a Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA) Foundation Accredited Training Partner. We also maintain partnerships and offer courses with Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA), International Council of E-Commerce Consultants (EC-Council), International Consortium for Agile (ICAgile), Information Systems Control Association (ISACA), International Info System Security Certification Consortium (ISC)2, International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB), Lean Kanban, Scrum Alliance, and The Open Group (TOGAF). In the United Kingdom, our courses can be used to gain a Master’s degree in Professional Computing at Staffordshire University under a program administered by the Faculty of Computing, Engineering and Technology.
 
In addition to training, we offer a suite of Workforce Optimization Solutions to support an IT organization’s life-cycle of workforce development needs. Our solutions help ensure that an organization’s investment in training is relevant and leveraged to improving overall organization performance. These solutions range from helping organizations define their job roles, to assessing the current skills of the staff, providing coaching and mentoring of staff, offering blended learning in which we use different training modalities to offer an organization an optimized learning approach and even serving as an outsourced provider of an organization’s learning and training requirements.

We market and present our training courses and Workforce Optimization Solutions through locally staffed operations in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden and Japan. In fiscal year 2017, we generated approximately 37% of our revenues outside of the United States. We coordinate, plan and deliver our courses at our own Education Centers, hotels, conference centers, other specially equipped facilities, and customer sites worldwide. 
 
We also offer courses through our proprietary live on-line learning platform, Learning Tree AnyWare™, which enables individuals located anywhere in the world to use an Internet browser to connect with the classroom and participate online in instructor-led classes being conducted live in our Education Centers, at customer locations, or at other specially equipped facilities, without the need to travel or commute to the course site. Once logged in, AnyWare™ class participants see and hear their classroom-based instructor and classmates in real time, and can view the instructor’s annotations on two in-class MagnaLearn™ projection screens. They are able to participate in discussions, ask questions, work in breakout sessions, and complete the hands-on exercises in the same way as their in-class counterparts under the guidance of an expert instructor. They gain the full benefit of our proprietary courseware, and achieve the same level of knowledge and skill transfer as in-class participants. Through technology such as AnyWare™, we are effectively applying technology to leverage the strengths of our classroom offerings while also providing greater flexibility to our customers by offering more scheduled course dates from which to choose. We are continuing to investigate other technology-based training formats and how they may be effectively integrated into our training programs.
 
Our instructors are not full-time employees of Learning Tree; rather, they are practicing professionals selected for their expertise of the subject matter they teach, who are compensated on the basis of the number of actual courses taught. Our average instructor has over 20 years of hands-on, real world experience in the fields that they teach. Learning Tree instructors teach an average of approximately seven course events per year on an as-needed basis. During the rest of the year, they typically work for other organizations either as full-time employees or as independent technical or management consultants. 
 
Business Strategy 
 
The needs of organizations for training and professional development are evolving, and particularly so in the IT technical, analyst, and management disciplines. Organizations, whether commercial companies or government agencies, are looking to ensure the investment in their IT workforce directly supports improved outcomes, including more successful project delivery, improved delivery processes and product quality, and ultimately improved business or mission outcomes. Further, from an individual learner’s perspective, the rise of e-learning solutions has provided significant new options for self-directed learning. As such, Learning Tree’s primary focus is evolving from being an IT training company for its customers’ employees to now becoming a company that partners with the IT organizations of its customers to meet the full range of an organization’s training needs for its workforce. As such, in addition to our goal of maintaining our position as the premier provider of instructor led IT training and professional development, our business strategy has evolved to encompass three objectives:

● | Offer a full range of Workforce Optimization Solutions that augment our traditional hands-on, instructor-led training capabilities. Our Workforce Optimization Solutions cover the life-cycle of workforce development needs, from helping organizations define their organization structures, processes, and job roles; to assessing the current knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) of the staff; to supporting the implementation of the means to enhance the KSAs through training, coaching, and mentoring of staff, along with supporting organizational process improvements; and to providing an outsourced service in which Learning Tree manages all of an organization’s learning initiatives. These additional solutions augment and support our traditional training service offerings. As an example, the use of Learning Tree’s automated skills assessments can provide customers with objective feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of their IT staff in their respective professional disciplines. Such information is particularly valuable in creating custom learning plans, including recommended training courses to maximize a staff member’s effectiveness on the job. From an organizational perspective, our instructors, who are practitioners in their field, can go beyond the classroom to support organizations in driving process changes, in areas as diverse as planning and budgeting, service management, and project management.

● | Add e-Learning capabilities to our training solutions. Based on existing studies, instructor-led training currently remains the best way to learn a subject area. Yet we recognize that self-directed e-Learning (meaning online courses without an instructor) continues to grow and gain market acceptance, given the convenience and lower costs of e-Learning in certain situations. Accordingly, Learning Tree believes that a blended learning approach, in which we work with an organization to harness the best of both instructor-led and e-learning is the most effective way to deliver our courses and for attendees to learn today. To that end, we have and will continue to work with our clients to develop customized e-Learning modules that are optimized to augment instructor-led classes. We intend to extend this model and work with other e-Learning platform providers, tailoring our classes to maximize the effectiveness of a blended learning solution.

● | Provide a comprehensive suite of training courses to meet the needs of IT organizations. Learning Tree develops and maintains its own proprietary course content for its training courses worldwide. In addition to our own proprietary courses, we strategically broadened our course offerings by adding titles from certification organizations, hardware and software vendors, and from other training vendors. As an example, we are partnering with ISC2, an organization offering cyber security professional certifications, to offer their courses for preparation of the exams to become a Certified Information Systems Security Professional (“CISSP”) and a Certified Cloud Security Professional (“CCSP”). In regards to vendor partners, we have entered an agreement to offer official Microsoft courseware that will be taught by our instructors at our Education Centers. While causing us to retire some of our proprietary Microsoft courses, we anticipate adding more than 70 Microsoft course titles, which will significantly broaden our Microsoft curriculum. In addition, the agreement also provides us with the ability to offer Microsoft on-demand courseware that can be taken any time. We are also now offering courses provided by other training providers for a wide range of courses, including training on Cisco, Adobe, IBM, Red Hat, VMware, Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto Networks, and Amazon Web Services products. By providing a comprehensive suite of training courses to IT organizations, we are able to more effectively partner in providing the full complement of courses needed by our customers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are experiencing growth in our business of supporting enterprise customers by providing them with Workforce Optimization Solutions and customized training products to meet their needs. However, we continue to experience a decline in course attendance at our public courses which are taught at our Education Centers. To address this decline, the Company has been working to leverage resellers and other partner models to increase our sales reach, increasing the size of our sales teams, shortening the duration of some of our courses and partnering with certification organizations and other training providers to broaden and deepen the training products we offer. Our overall objective continues to be the reversal of the year-over-year declines in revenue we have experienced recently by stabilizing revenue from training offered to our clients at our Education Centers while growing revenue from enterprise clients through Workforce Optimization Solutions and other customized training products. 
 
Comprehensive Cost Reduction Program
 
In addition to strategies to stabilize and grow our revenue in fiscal year 2018 and improve liquidity, we continued to reduce our operating expenses through a comprehensive cost reduction program initiated in fiscal year 2016. As a result of this program, we reduced operating expense by approximately $10.7 million in fiscal year 2017 compared to operating expense in fiscal year 2016. This excludes non-cash restructuring charges of $1.9 million in fiscal year 2016 and $0.4 million in fiscal year 2017 relating to excess classroom capacity at our Reston, VA facility. In addition, we reduced our cost of revenues in fiscal year 2017 by $9.9 million or 19.7% by right-sizing our operations and reducing travel and shipping costs. We intend to continue taking appropriate steps to streamline our operations to reduce or eliminate excess costs.  
Workforce Optimization Solutions. 
 
As described above, a core strategy is to grow our position as a leading worldwide provider of training and workforce development to IT professionals and managers of large national and multinational companies, medium-size companies and government organizations. Over the past few years, we have started working with our clients to provide additional services that address the life cycle of organizational performance challenges that exists within IT organizations worldwide. To that end, we introduced IT Workforce Optimization Solutions during the 2015 fiscal year, which is a comprehensive suite of services to support the IT organizations of our clients with the objective of: defining organizational structure, processes, and job roles; assessing current staff skills and abilities; implementing performance improvements by enhancing the skills and abilities of staff and helping to implement process improvements; and providing an outsourcing service in which Learning Tree provides the full management of an organization’s learning initiatives. Workforce Optimization Solutions augments and enhances our core training capabilities enabling Learning Tree to partner with our customers in helping them develop a high-performing organization through workforce development and process improvement.

As part of Workforce Optimization Solutions, we offer a skills assessment solution aligned with competencies defined by the non-profit organization, Skills Assessment for the Information Age (SFIA) Foundation. Our current skills assessment library contains more than 15,000 questions that cover 130 different roles across IT disciplines. We have developed an automated, online tool for individuals to complete assessments, and we are working with several companies to help them assess staff competencies as input to developing individual learning plans.
 
Through Workforce Optimization Solutions, we are successfully providing Project Acceleration Workshops for organizations. These workshops combine training with support work on a specific customer project. For example, a Project Acceleration Workshop might be focused on creating a Work Break Down (WBS) structure for a project, and as such our instructor would provide training to the customer project team on that subject. But the Workshop would then focus on the creation of a WBS for a specific customer project, so that at the end of the Workshop, the customer project team has both a tangible tool and skill to help manage their project. We frequently receive positive feedback on the value of these workshops by both attendees and the customer organizations. 
 
While Workforce Optimization Solutions is a key strategic initiative for the Company, we do not anticipate Workforce Optimization Solutions in and of itself will generate significant revenue as a product.  It is, however, an important strategy to expand our relationships with both existing and new customers and as such, positions us to offer additional training solutions, particularly to larger customers.
 
In addition to our new business strategies, we continue to invest in and develop our sales functions. Beginning in fiscal year 2018, we combined our North American sales forces into a single team that now enables every sales representative to offer the best training solution for the customer. This change together with the Workforce Optimization Solutions we now offer has enabled us to better position ourselves to support large corporations and government agencies and has supported our financial objective by helping us to begin to once again grow our revenue base.
 
 Commitment to Quality Training. For the past 43 years, we have set the highest standards of excellence in educating and training IT professionals and managers throughout the world. Our course participants have consistently rated Learning Tree instructors and courses at the top end of the scale. These ratings reflect our ongoing commitment to quality and innovations in instructional delivery, including our patented MagnaLearn™ Instructional Enhancement System, AdaptaLearn™ Hands-On Learning System, After-Course Instructor Coaching, Computing Sandbox for Practice and Experiments, as well as the latest up-to-date hands-on course equipment, continuing revision and updating of our course materials, and the ongoing training and coaching of our already superb instructors. Our AnyWare™ e-Learning platform extends the full range of Learning Tree features and standards to our online participants, so that they enjoy the same results as our in-class participants. 
 
  High Quality Instructor Team. As of September 29, 2017, we had more than 650 course instructors located around the world. Learning Tree instructors are practicing professionals with expert subject knowledge. Our average instructor has over 20 years of “hands-on, real world” experience in the fields they teach. Learning Tree instructors teach an average of approximately seven course events per year on an as-needed basis. During the rest of the year, they typically work for other organizations either as full-time employees or as independent technical or management consultants. This on-demand structure enables us to quickly schedule additional courses anywhere in the world and to respond efficiently to customers’ needs for IT and management skills training. Our course participants particularly benefit because Learning Tree instructors generally spend the majority of their time working in industry settings, and therefore provide our course participants with up-to-date, practical knowledge and skills in the latest technological and management developments. Our instructors also provide us with unique access to a large pool of industry experts on IT and management trends throughout the world that is especially valuable in our decisions and development process for new course titles. 
 
Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled instructors. We use a systemized process in each of our local operating subsidiaries to identify, engage, train, coach, and evaluate our instructor team. Our instructors are highly loyal as evidenced by our annual instructor retention rate of over 90%.
 
Broad Course Library. We offer a broad course library which as of September 29, 2017 totaled 318 instructor-led one- to five-day course titles comprising a total of 5,889 hours of classroom instruction covering a wide range of IT and management topics.

As a leading provider of IT training, our objective is to provide our customers with job-focused, hands-on learning experiences that best meet their needs for the development of their professional IT staff and managers. We design our proprietary courses to provide participants an unbiased perspective of both the strengths and limitations of software and hardware products and an understanding of how to compare and integrate multiple platforms and technologies from various vendors. Drawing from the expertise of our international team of instructors, each course incorporates multiple points of view concerning IT applications used throughout the world. Our IT courses are designed to be highly interactive; most involve “hands-on” training on networked state-of-the-art workstations so that participants can practice and assimilate the skills being taught. Participants spend a significant portion of each hands-on course working on computer-based exercises and participating in group workshops and class interactions. As a result, they return to their jobs with the confidence to immediately apply the new skills and knowledge they have gained.
 
To ensure that we can meet the full needs of our customers for IT training, we are selectively augmenting our own proprietary courses by offering courses from vendors and other content providers.  Prior to adding any such courses to our library, we use our subject matter experts to review the courses to ensure that such courses will meet the standards of quality that our customers expect from Learning Tree. 
 
Our management courses, while including core concepts and theory, focus heavily on providing practical skills, tools, and techniques that participants can apply immediately upon returning to their jobs. Participants work extensively in group exercises that provide them an opportunity to practice applying key concepts in real-world situations. These real-world scenarios are primarily delivered through our performance-based management training platform which brings the real world to life in the classroom through the use of computer-based and rich-media simulations, supplemented with substantial amounts of hands-on exercises and group activities, all facilitated by experts in their respective fields. 
  
As of September 29, 2017, we offered 159 multi-day titles in our IT curriculum, compared to 140 multi-day titles at the end of fiscal year 2016. As of September 29, 2017, we offered 76 multi-day titles in our management curriculum, compared to 70 multi-day titles at the end of fiscal year 2016. As of September 29, 2017, we offered 83 one-day courses compared to 139 one-day course titles at the end of fiscal year 2016, bringing the total number of courses offered to 318. The number of one-day course titles declined significantly in 2017 because we retired a large number of these courses due to low demand.

Over our 43-year history, we have developed and implemented a well-defined, systematic approach for rapidly developing, customizing and updating courses in the Learning Tree library and for translating our course content into multiple languages. We organize courses into curricula that reflect general topics or disciplines. We continuously update our course curriculum structure and course content and add new course titles to keep pace with the introduction of new technologies and to reflect the evolving training needs of our customers. To identify potential new courses for development, we incorporate feedback from the worldwide Learning Tree instructor team, course participants and customers, and from the development groups of leading IT vendors. In fiscal year 2017, we introduced 63 new multi-day course titles, while retiring 38 multi-day and 56 one-day course titles. We expect course development costs to vary in the future, primarily depending on the number of new titles we introduce in any period, as well as the overall size of the total course library we must maintain. As described above, we also partner with other organizations to offer their course titles.
 
International Infrastructure and Logistics Capability. We meet customer demand for scheduling flexibility by delivering course events frequently and at multiple locations throughout the world, and by making our advertised course titles available online through Learning Tree AnyWare™. Our sophisticated infrastructure and logistics capability allow us to coordinate, plan and deliver Learning Tree courses at our education centers, hotels, and conference facilities worldwide. We also present standard or customized courses on demand at customer facilities whenever and wherever desired, with quality standards that are identical to those for courses presented in Learning Tree Education Centers. By using our team of 650 instructors, our course development and customization processes, our team of customer support specialists, our logistics team and our thousands of classroom computer workstations, we can rapidly and effectively deliver our Learning Tree courses both domestically and internationally. 
 
In fiscal year 2017, we presented 4,543 course events at Learning Tree Education Centers and at third-party and customer sites in a total of 39 countries. We currently operate wholly-owned subsidiaries in the United States (since 1974), the United Kingdom (since 1978), Canada (since 1985), Sweden (since 1986) and Japan (since 1989). Each subsidiary is staffed by local personnel responsible for the sale and delivery of courses in its local country as well as in other designated countries. In fiscal year 2017, our foreign operations produced approximately 37% of our revenues. See Note 9 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for financial data regarding operating segments and geographic regions. In August 2017, the Company terminated its License Agreement, dated March 3, 2015, with Educinvest SPRL, which became effective immediately. The License Agreement was entered into with Educinvest at the time of the sale of the Company’s subsidiary in France and provided for the license of courses by Educinvest in France.  The French market is now being served by our UK operation while the Company is evaluating other business opportunities that may be available to it as a result of the termination of the License Agreement. 
 
Long-Term Relationships with Global Customer Base. We have built long-standing relationships with our customer base of large national and multinational companies, medium-sized companies and government organizations throughout the world, and seek to build continuing relationships both with these employers and with the individual employees who participate in our courses. Our customers operate in a wide range of sectors, including finance, computer, communications, electronics, systems integration, aerospace, government and military, manufacturing, and energy. Of our 100 largest clients in fiscal year 2012, 99 were still our clients five years later in fiscal year 2017. In fiscal year 2017, more than 100 of our corporate and government customers purchased at least $100,000 of Learning Tree services. No one commercial customer or government agency accounted for 10% or more of our revenues in fiscal year 2017. 
 
Backlog. Our sales backlog at September 29, 2017 was $13.5 million. This compares to a sales backlog of $14.8 million at September 30, 2016. We currently expect the entire backlog to be executed within fiscal year 2018. 
 
Multi-Tiered Sales and Marketing Organization. We have a multi-tiered sales and marketing organization that integrates digital marketing, telemarketing and field sales to market and sell our course offerings to existing customers and to attract new customers. As of September 29, 2017, we employed a team of 28 full-time field sales representatives and a telemarketing sales team of 81 full and part-time telemarketers and related support staff.
 
We maintain a strong brand image for providing high-quality training for IT professionals and managers through the prominent use of our trademarks in our marketing and course materials. We market our courses primarily through digital marketing campaigns and electronic mail to our proprietary database of approximately three (3) million technology professionals and managers who have attended, inquired about, or sent a staff member to Learning Tree courses. We send targeted, personalized e-mails through our automated e-mail marketing system to advise prospective course participants of upcoming events. We also market our products and services on our website (www.learningtree.com). Information contained on our website is not part of this Form 10-K.

To encourage repeat purchases from existing customers, we have introduced My Learning Tree for attendees and managers of attendees. Learning Tree customers are provided with their own ‘My Learning Tree’ account, which attendees and their managers can use to access a growing list of unique benefits. We also offer multiple-course discount programs through Learning Tree “Training Passports” and Learning Tree “Training Vouchers”, and provide the Specialist and Expert Certification Programs. We believe that in addition to generating revenues directly, these programs foster long-term relationships with participants and encourage participants to recommend Learning Tree courses to their colleagues. 
 
Learning Tree Training Passports permit an individual Passport holder to attend up to a specified number of courses, generally two, three or four, during a one- to two-year period. List prices for Passports are significantly discounted from the list price of the equivalent number of individual courses. The Learning Tree Training Voucher program allows corporate customers to buy Vouchers in quantities from three to hundreds at volume-discounted prices, for future courses to be taken by any person in the customer organization generally over a 12-month period. 
 
Markets and Competition 
 
Instructor-Led Training. We are a for-profit provider of IT training and management education. Our main competitors offer course titles and programs similar to ours at prices in a range equal to or lower than ours.
 
The IT and management training markets in which we compete include outside third-party providers, as well as in-house training conducted by organizations for their own employees. In addition, third-party providers of training include non-profit associations, as well as “for-profit providers” and both for-profit and non-profit “academic providers”, who offer courses that lead to accredited undergraduate or graduate degrees. 
  
The IT and management training market is highly fragmented with low barriers to entry. We face intense competition from both established entities and new entries in the market. Our primary competitors include:


• | internal training departments;
--+-------------------------------


• | computer hardware and software vendors and their authorized training and education center partners;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | independent education and training companies;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | academic providers; and
--+------------------------


• | systems integrators and value-added resellers.
--+-----------------------------------------------

 
Many third-party training providers offer training as one of several services or product lines. We differentiate ourselves from these providers based on our experience over four decades, the breadth and quality of our proprietary course library, our addition of workforce optimization solutions, our worldwide delivery capability, and the size, quality and experience of our instructor force. 
 
Internal training departments generally deliver training at lower cost than third parties and provide companies with the most control over the method and content of training, enabling them to tailor programs to their specific needs. However, internal trainers find it difficult to keep pace with new technologies, lack the hands-on experience needed to teach the latest technological developments and lack the capacity to meet demand for training, and therefore many organizations must supplement their internal training resources with externally supplied training. This is particularly relevant when dealing with new and emerging technologies. Additionally, internal training departments may not deliver consistent content or use consistent instructional methods on a worldwide basis, while we offer consistent course contents, instructional methods, and quality around the globe. 
 
E-Learning and Blended Learning. IT and management training are primarily delivered by classroom instructors, video, and technology-based training, including Internet-based e-learning and printed means. Independent industry reports suggest that, consistent with the prior ten years, instructor-led classroom delivery continues to be the most widely used method for delivery of corporate training, with approximately 66% of all training being instructor-led. We believe this is because instructor-led training provides the greatest ability for participants to learn, practice and receive feedback on their mastery of new knowledge and skills. Course participants value the personalized interaction and problem-solving with their instructor and fellow participants, and the opportunity to get expert advice on the application of the course material to their own projects. Furthermore, instructor-led classroom training insulates course participants from workplace interruptions and accelerates their learning of new technologies. The use of technology-based IT training formats, such as Internet-based e-learning, has gained acceptance in the IT and management training and education market, largely gaining market share at the expense of other self-study formats including video and printed materials. 
 
 11



We have continued to investigate technology-based training formats and how they might effectively be integrated into our training programs. We developed Learning Tree AnyWare™, our proprietary live online learning platform that integrates participants in remote online locations into live class events in another location. Remote participants use an ordinary Internet connection to connect to our AnyWare™ classroom interface. Once logged in, remote AnyWare™ class participants see and hear their classroom-based instructor and classmates in real time, and view the instructor’s annotations on two in-class MagnaLearn™ projection screens. They are able to participate in discussions, ask questions, work in breakout sessions, and complete the same hands-on exercises under the guidance of an expert instructor as their in-class counterparts. With the use of our AnyWare™ product, our clients anywhere in the world can choose to participate in any course event being taught at any of our Education Centers, without the need to travel or commute to the actual course site. 
 
We have utilized stand-alone AnyWare™ Learning Centers in strategic locations to promote the use of on-line attendance through the use of our AnyWare™ product. These AnyWare™ Learning Centers provide our customers convenient access to our courses via our AnyWare™ platform in a setting optimized for equipment, communication, Internet connectivity speed, and learning environment, at a location near to where they live or work, minimizing added travel costs to attend courses at our Education Centers. As acceptance of the AnyWare™ product has grown, we have reduced the number of stand-alone AnyWare™ Learning Centers, which are typically located in short-term leased facilities with a capacity to handle from two to five attendees. As of September 29, 2017, we had a total of 17 Learning Tree AnyWare™ Learning Centers, including six stand-alone AnyWare™ Learning Centers in North America, four in Sweden, and another seven located within our Education Centers.

 In recognition of the growing use of e-learning products in the IT and Management training market, we are selectively incorporating e-learning capabilities into our course library to improve our customers’ learning experience.  We currently offer a number e-learning products, including products from Microsoft, EC-Council, and Red Hat.  During fiscal year 2018, we anticipate releasing additional products, including stand-alone labs for various technologies and blended learning modules which augment instructor-led courses with e-learning capabilities.

Learning Tree does not expect to comment further or update the market with any additional information on the strategic options it is evaluating, unless and until its Board of Directors deems disclosure appropriate or necessary.

We develop proprietary course content and own the copyright to the majority of course materials we develop. We believe these copyrights help differentiate our services from those of our competitors.
 
Our MagnaLearn® Instructional Enhancement System is covered by patents in the United States and a number of foreign countries. The MagnaLearn® system gives Learning Tree instructors greater flexibility to customize and pace course presentations by allowing them to annotate, highlight and manipulate course materials on two independent projection screens, in real time. The system also provides automated feedback to our course development staff, allowing us to continually improve and update our course content worldwide and on an immediate basis from a centralized location. 
 
We have also obtained patent protection in the United States and a number of foreign countries related to our Learning Tree AnyWare™ live online learning platform. 
 
Regulatory Environment 
 
We are paid directly by the employers of course participants and do not receive funding from any government student-aid or loan programs. As a result, we do not depend on government Title IV funding and are generally exempt from the governmental regulation of public education providers. However, our results of operations could be affected by future changes to current licensing or regulatory requirements.
