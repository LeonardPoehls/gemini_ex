Agritek Holdings Inc. intends to build on its existing relationships by developing operating plans and providing oversight, strategy and management of the business units’ growth and integration. Further, Agritek Holdings plans to continue expanding its reach by building new partnerships with vertical market partners and end- user products companies as well as exploring opportunities with successful cultivators and processors. Through its expansion efforts, Agritek Holdings intends to utilize online sales and marketing platforms, participate in relevant trade shows and develop various advertising materials to communicate its multiple licensed brands including “California Premiums”, “Hemp Pops” and additional CBD products.
 
Agritek Holdings is also well-positioned to participate in the large and growing legal cannabis market for enhanced downstream cannabis products and new products with various consumer and medical applications.
 
Agritek Holdings focuses on the growth of its business units and expanding their reach to end-users and partners. Although the business units are primarily responsible for developing and operating their respective businesses, Agritek Holdings is available to provide functional expertise, financing, oversight and a framework of disciplined planning to the operations of the business units when needed.
 
Agritek Holdings’ short-term objective is to create a sustainable business in the key states of California, Colorado, Washington and Oregon as well as in Canada and Puerto Rico by integrating its holdings to create synergies and true end-to-end solutions geared to the needs of patients and consumers. Agritek Holdings has positioned itself for commercial growth by focusing its expanded resource base on finding and partnering with the best and most innovative companies, projects, assets and overall business frameworks in the legal cannabis sector in the aforementioned jurisdictions.
 
To achieve its objectives, the Company will continue making specific and deliberate investments, including acquisitions, to:
 

1. | Increase the diversity and quality of the Company’s product offerings across different market segments; and 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Increase the strength and segmentation of the Company’s diversified portfolio of real estate holdings and product brands. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, management believes that significant opportunities exist today and will develop further in the future, to leverage the Company’s expertise, financial strength and business model in legal cannabis markets around the world. Agritek Holdings intends on pursuing opportunities in a number of jurisdictions where cannabis use is legal, and/or where governments are actively pursuing legalization.
 
Subject to legislative and regulatory compliance, strategic business opportunities pursued by the Company could include:
 

1. | Providing advisory services to third-parties that are interested in establishing licensed cannabis cultivation, processing and sales operations;

The Company intends to bring its’ array of services to each new state that legalizes the use of cannabis according to appropriate state and federal laws. Our primary objective is acquiring commercial properties to be utilized in the commercial marijuana industry as cultivation facilities in compliance with state law. This is an essential aspect of our overall growth strategy because once acquired and re-zoned, the value of such real property is substantially higher than under the previous zoning and use.
 
Once properties are identified and acquired to be used for purposes related to the commercial marijuana industry as provided for by state law, and we plan to create vertical channels within that legal jurisdiction including equipment financing, payment processing and marketing of exclusive brands and services to retail dispensaries
 
Agritek’s business focus is primarily to hold, develop and manage real property. The Company shall also provide oversight on every property that is part of its portfolio. This can include complete architectural design and subsequent build-outs, general support, landscaping, general up-keep, and state of the art security systems. At this time, Agritek does not grow, process, own, handle, transport, or sell marijuana as the Company is organized and directed to operate strictly in accordance with all applicable state and federal laws.
 
Services and Markets
 
To date, we have purchased eighty (80) acres approved for licenses and cultivation in Pueblo, Colorado. We have multiple manufacturing and service contracts in place in areas in the following sectors:
Funding and Financing Solutions
 
Our goal is to become the funding and financing service partner of choice in the legal Colorado and California cannabis market before expanding nationwide if and when applicable state and federal laws allow us to do so. We offer financing and financial aid to cultivators, collectives, dispensaries and product businesses in the legal cannabis industry with alternative funding and financing solutions. In the evolving legal cannabis industry, where traditional banking opportunities are grossly limited, we step in to provide the “traditional” bank lending services; lines of credit, property financing, and/or commercial loans. Businesses and individuals seeking funding and financing solutions are qualified and scored based on their experience, current operations, financial records, and compliance grades given by our proprietary banking partners and credit lines that comply with all state governance rules.
Commercial Build Out and Dispensary Solutions
 
We offer turnkey build-out and commercial services to our clients. Whether it is financial assistance, real estate consulting, operations design, or building construction, our Company can design and rollout customized services for our clients. We also offer traditional business services to dispensaries as well. These services include infrastructure investment, technology partners, donation accounting, payment processing and succession strategies. It is important to note that we are not a “one size fits all” organization, but are committed to custom tailored solutions for legal cannabis industry participants.
Finance and Real Estate
 
Real Estate Leasing
 
Our real estate leasing business primarily includes the acquisition and leasing of cultivation space and related facilities to licensed marijuana growers and dispensary owners for their operations. Management anticipates that these facilities will range in size from 5,000 to 50,000 square feet. These facilities will only be leased to tenants that possess the requisite state licenses to operate cultivation facilities. The leases with the tenants will provide certain requirements that permit us to continually evaluate our tenants’ compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
 
As of the date of this report, we own one cultivation property that is located in a suburb of Pueblo, Colorado (the “Pueblo West Property”). The property consists of approximately eighty (80) acres of land. The property is currently zoned for cultivating cannabis and is expected to be leased to a medical cannabis cultivator or manufacturer this year. We are currently evaluating strategic options for this property.

Shared Office Space, Networking and Event Services  
 
We plan to continue to acquire commercial real estate and lease office space to participants in the cannabis industry. These participants include media, internet, packaging, lighting, cultivation supplies, and financial services. In exchange for certain services that may be provided to these tenants, we expect to receive rental income. In certain cases, we may acquire equity interests or provide debt capital to these businesses and eventually acquire a specific business as a wholly owned subsidiary of Agritek.
Industry Finance and Equipment Leasing Services
 
We plan to lease cultivation equipment and facilities to customers in the cannabis industry. We expect we will enter into sale lease-back transactions of land zoned for cultivation, green houses, grow lights, tenant improvements and other grow equipment. Since Colorado State law does not allow entities operating under a cannabis license to pledge the assets or the license of the cannabis operation for any type of general borrowing activity, we intend to provide loans to individuals and businesses in the cannabis industry on an unsecured basis. Equipment will only be leased to tenants that possess the requisite state licenses to operate such facilities. The leases with the tenants will provide certain requirements that permit us to continually evaluate its tenants’ compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
 
Our finance strategy will include making direct term loans and providing revolving lines of credit to businesses involved in the cultivation and sale of cannabis and related products. These loans will generally be secured to the maximum extent permitted by law. We believe there is a significant demand for this financing. We are pursuing other finance services including customized finance, capital formation, and banking, for participants in the cannabis industry.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe we possess certain competitive strengths and advantages in the industries which we operate:
 
Range of Services:  We are able to leverage our breadth of services and resources to deliver a comprehensive, integrated solution to companies in the cannabis industry – from operational and compliance consulting to security and marketing to financing needs.
 
Strategic Alliances. We are dedicated to rapid growth through acquisitions, partnerships and agreements that will enable us to enter and expand into new markets. Our strategy in pursuing these alliances are based on the target’s ability to generate positive cash flow, effectively meet customer needs, and supply desirable products, services or technologies, among other considerations. We anticipate that strategic alliances will play a significant role as more states pass legislation permitting the cultivation and sale of hemp and cannabis.
 
Industry’s Access to Capital. In February 2014, the Treasury Department issued guidelines for financial institutions dealing with cannabis-related businesses, (see “FinCEN” under “Federal Regulations and Our Business” of this document). In March 2015, legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate proposing to change federal law such that states could regulate medical use of cannabis without risk of federal prosecution. A key component of the proposed Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States Act (the “CARERS Act”) is to reclassify cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act to Schedule II, thereby changing the plant from a federally-criminalized substance to one that has recognized medical uses. Many banks and traditional financial institutions refuse to provide financial services to cannabis-related business. We plan to provide finance and leasing solutions to market participants using the FinCEN guidelines as a primary guide for compliance with federal law.
 
Regulatory Compliance. The state laws regulating the cannabis industry are changing at a rapid pace. Currently, there are twenty-six U.S. states and the District of Columbia that have created a legislative body to manage the medical cannabis industry. There are also five states that have allowed recreational use. In Colorado and Washington states, cannabis is heavily regulated. It is a critical component of our business plan both to ensure that all aspects of our operations are in compliance with all laws, policies, guidance and regulations to which we are subject and to provide an opportunity to our customers and allies to use our services to ensure that they, too, are in full compliance.

Industry Breadth. We continue to create, share and leverage information and experiences with the purpose of creating awareness and identifying opportunities to increase shareholder value. Our management team has extensive knowledge of the cannabis industry and closely monitors changes in legislation. We work with partners who enhance our industry breadth.
 
Intellectual Property
 
On November 17, 2016, we filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) a federal trademark registration for “Hemp Pops” in the category of Staple Food Products.
Competition
 
Currently, there are a number of other companies that provide similar products and/or services, such as direct finance, leasing of real estate, including shared workspace, warehouse sales, and consulting services to the cannabis industry. In the future we fully expect that other companies will recognize the value of ancillary businesses serving the cannabis industry and enter into the marketplace as competitors.
 
The cannabis industry in the United States is highly fragmented, rapidly expanding and evolving. The industry is characterized by new and potentially disruptive or conflicting legislation propounded on a state-by-state basis. Our competitors may be local or international enterprises and may have financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources greater than ours. These companies may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and consultants.
 
Our competitive position will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified underwriters, investment banking partners and loan managers, consultants and advisors with industry depth, and talented managerial, operational and other personnel. Our competitive position will also depend on our ability to develop and acquire effective proprietary products and solutions, personal relationships of our executive officers and directors, and our ability to secure adequate capital resources. We compete to attract and retain customers of our services. We expect to compete in this area on the basis of price, regulatory compliance, vendor relationships, usefulness, availability, and ease of use of our services.
 
Government Regulation
 
As of January 31, 2018, there are 30 states plus the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulation that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment. Many other states are considering similar legislation. Conversely, the federal government regulates drugs through the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”), which does not recognize the difference between medical and recreational use of cannabis. Under federal law, cannabis is treated like every other controlled substance, such as cocaine and heroin. The federal government places every controlled substance in a schedule, in principle according to its relative potential for abuse and medicinal value. Under the CSA, cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug, which means that the federal government views medical cannabis as highly addictive and having no medical value. Pursuant to the CSA, it is unlawful for any person (1) to sell or offer for sale drug paraphernalia; (2) to use the mails or any other facility of interstate commerce to transport drug paraphernalia; or (3) to import or export drug paraphernalia.
 
The extent to which the regulation of drug paraphernalia under the CSA is applicable to our business and the sale of our product is found in the definition of drug paraphernalia. Drug paraphernalia means any equipment, product, or material of any kind which is primarily intended or designed for use in manufacturing, compounding, converting, concealing, producing processing, preparing, injecting ingesting, inhaling or otherwise introducing into the human body a controlled substance, possession of which is unlawful. Our products are primarily designed for general agricultural use.
 
The United States Congress previously used the rider provision in the fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017 known as the Consolidated Appropriations Acts (formerly the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment) to thwart the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to prevent states from implementing their own laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.  The “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018” now known as the “Leahy Amendment,” is a $1.3 trillion-dollar spending bill, which will now allow continued protections for the implementation of state medical marijuana programs through fiscal year end, September 30, 2018.

The 2018 appropriations protection, continues this provision to 46 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico, with the exclusion of Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The 2018 spending bill also continues existing provisions shielding state industrial hemp research programs from federal interference. 
 
FinCEN
 
The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) provided guidance on February 14, 2014 about how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) obligations. For purposes of the FinCEN guidelines, a “financial institution” includes any person doing business in one or more of the following capacities:
 

• | Bank (except bank credit card systems); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broker or dealer in securities; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Money services business; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Telegraph company; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Casino;
--+--------


• | Card club; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | A person subject to supervision by any state or federal bank supervisory authority. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In general, the decision to open, close, or refuse any particular account or relationship should be made by each financial institution based on a number of factors specific to that institution. These factors may include its particular business objectives, an evaluation of the risks associated with offering a particular product or service, and its capacity to manage those risks effectively. Thorough customer due diligence is a critical aspect of making this assessment.
 
In assessing the risk of providing services to a cannabis-related business, a financial institution should conduct customer due diligence that includes: (i) verifying with the appropriate state authorities whether the business is duly licensed and registered; (ii) reviewing the license application (and related documentation) submitted by the business for obtaining a state license to operate its cannabis-related business; (iii) requesting from state licensing and enforcement authorities available information about the business and related parties; (iv) developing an understanding of the normal and expected activity for the business, including the types of products to be sold and the type of customers to be served (e.g., medical versus recreational customers); (v) ongoing monitoring of publicly available sources for adverse information about the business and related parties; (vi) ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity, including for any of the red flags described in this guidance; and (vii) refreshing information obtained as part of customer due diligence on a periodic basis and commensurate with the risk. With respect to information regarding state licensure obtained in connection with such customer due diligence, a financial institution may reasonably rely on the accuracy of information provided by state licensing authorities, where states make such information available.
 
As part of its customer due diligence, a financial institution should consider whether a cannabis-related business violates state law. This is a particularly important factor for a financial institution to consider when assessing the risk of providing financial services to a cannabis-related business. Considering this factor also enables the financial institution to provide information in BSA reports pertinent to law enforcement’s priorities. A financial institution that decides to provide financial services to a cannabis-related business would be required to file suspicious activity reports.
 
While we believe we do not qualify as a financial institution in the United States, we cannot be certain that we do not fall under the scope of the FinCEN guidelines. We plan to use the FinCEN Guidelines, as may be amended, as a basis for assessing our relationships with potential tenants, clients and customers. As such, as we engage in financing activities, we intend to adhere to the guidance of FinCEN in conducting and monitoring our financial transactions. Because this area of the law is uncertain but expected to evolve rapidly, we believe that FinCEN’s guidelines will help us best operate in a prudent, reasonable and acceptable manner. There is no assurance, however, that our activities will not violate some aspect of the CSA. If we are found to violate the federal statute or any other in connection with our activities, our company could face serious criminal and civil sanctions.
 
We intend to conduct rigorous due diligence to verify the legality of all activities that we engage in. We realize that there is a discrepancy between the laws in some states, which permit the distribution and sale of medical and recreational cannabis, from federal law that prohibits any such activities. The CSA makes it illegal under federal law to manufacture, distribute, or dispense cannabis. Many states impose and enforce similar prohibitions. Notwithstanding the federal ban, as of the date of this filing, twenty-six states and the District of Columbia have legalized certain cannabis-related activity.

Moreover, since the use of cannabis is illegal under federal law, we may have difficulty acquiring or maintaining bank accounts and insurance and our stockholders may find it difficult to deposit their stock with brokerage firms.
 
Employees
 
Other than the Company’s sole officer and director, we do not have any full-time employees. The Company relies on several independent contractors and other agreements it has with other companies to provide the services needed. Each contractor has been carefully selected to address immediate needs in particular functional areas, but also with consideration of the Company’s future needs during a period of expected rapid growth and expansion. Value is placed not only on outstanding credentials in specific areas of functional expertise, but also on cross-functionality, a strong knowledge of content acquisition and distribution, along with hands-on experience in scaling operations from initial beta and development stage through successful commercial deployment.
