Item 1. Business
Overview
We have developed innovative solutions that deliver pervasive, dynamic, and intelligent visibility into data-in-motion traveling across networks of any scale. We believe the visibility and control offered by our solutions is necessary to effectively manage, secure and understand data crossing modern physical and virtual infrastructure. Our Visibility Platform consists of a distributed system of visibility nodes (in a combination we refer to as a "Visibility Fabric") deployed across an organization's infrastructure that are orchestrated from a common software management plane. Our Visibility Platform enables organizations to intelligently find, shape and move the relevant traffic to the appropriate security and monitoring tools within their operational environment. Our platform is comprised of data center and central office physical appliances, virtual nodes for virtualized, private cloud or public cloud environments, and small form-factor remote site appliances that in combination establish a Visibility Fabric.
Information is the lifeblood of every organization. Organizations today face a data-in-motion dilemma: increasing volumes of critical data that are traveling at increasing speed throughout their network infrastructure, while they are now also faced with growing security threats. This data-in-motion dilemma accentuates operational complexity, risk and cost for businesses as the sheer quantity and complexity of the data-in-motion can overwhelm the ability of traditional network infrastructure to manage, secure and understand the data traversing the network. We believe that the legacy centralized approach to management, and the 'perimeter-based' approach to secure infrastructure is now insufficient due to the distributed nature of information spread across private/public/hybrid cloud, on-premise data centers and remote sites render the past approach obsolete. Consequently, we believe the most appropriate way to solve this dilemma is with pervasive visibility in real-time, visibility into and control of data-in-motion extracted from anywhere across the infrastructure: physical or virtual. We believe, quite simply, that visibility into data-in-motion is essential in order to operate modern IT infrastructures.
In addition to the proliferation of data-in-motion, security, virtualization, cloud computing, software defined networking or "SDN," and network functions virtualization or "NFV", are fundamentally reshaping the way enterprises and service providers design and manage their infrastructure. As these forces combine to enable significant benefits, they also create major challenges in how enterprises and service providers design, operate, secure and manage the data in motion across their networks. For example, the increasing number of security breaches and escalating threats facing enterprises has significantly accelerated the need for security practitioners to obtain intelligent visibility of the traffic flowing through their infrastructure. Empowered with such visibility, security architects can implement architectures that increase the effectiveness of the security appliances and strategies they deploy. Likewise, the disaggregation of hardware and software, as well as separation of control plane intelligence and packet forwarding in SDN and NFV models, enhances the need for visibility and control of network infrastructure without degrading network performance or reliability. As networks migrate to 10, 40 and 100 Gigabit speeds and beyond, traditional approaches to deploying operational tools are constrained by their limited capacity and reach.
Our Visibility Platform was purposely built to help organizations optimize the reliability, performance and security of their physical and virtual network infrastructure, to minimize current and future capital investment in management, analysis, compliance and security tools, reduce operating expenses and realize greater value from existing tools that are deployed throughout their organization. We believe our Visibility Platform enables organizations to better:

• | Manage: IT departments can significantly increase the effectiveness, efficiency and performance of their network management, analysis and compliance tools.


• | Secure: Organizations can dramatically improve their cyber-security posture by leveraging the power of a Visibility Fabric to provide pervasive insight within the perimeter of their IT infrastructure; and


• | Understand: Entities such as mobile service providers can gain understanding of subscriber behavior and in doing so increase revenue generating opportunities, provide improved services for their subscribers, while enabling them to reduce operational costs.

Our GigaSECURE Security Delivery Platform enhances our Visibility Platform and is an architectural approach to streamline security operations by providing comprehensive infrastructure visibility that is specifically tuned to the needs of security tools, including those typically used by enterprises. Our solution enables security teams and IT personnel to gain advanced visibility into their IT infrastructure by dynamically forwarding selected traffic of interest from network, server and remote location infrastructure to security, management, analysis and compliance tools in a manner optimized for specific uses or functions. Given the inherent asymmetrical relationship between a cyber-security attacker and the organization tasked with the 
3

defense of infrastructure, we believe a significant opportunity to bring parity to their roles is to deploy a Visibility Fabric solution, and in doing so, significantly reduces the window of threat exposure for an organization. 
Our GigaSECURE Security Delivery Platform is comprised of six key building blocks:

• | Visibility Fabric nodes, deployed physically or virtually, that are distributed throughout the infrastructure to gain access to network traffic at key locations;


• | a metadata (NetFlow/IPFIX) record generation engine to summarize network traffic into flow records for consumption by the tools;


• | an SSL decryption engine that enables receivers to inspect SSL encrypted traffic for malware;


• | an Application Session Filtering engine that extracts entire application sessions containing specific patterns of interest to be delivered to the tools;


• | an advanced set of capabilities that allows multiple security tools to be placed either in-line with the network or out-of-band without compromising network availability; and


• | a management and orchestration platform that exposes a rich set of application programmer interfaces (APIs) to facilitate tighter integration between the GigaSECURE Security Delivery Platform and network security tools.

In 2016, we extended our Visibility Platform into the public cloud with the Visibility Platform on Amazon Web Services or AWS. This cloud-native visibility solution enables organizations to obtain consistent visibility regardless of whether their infrastructure resides in the public cloud on-premise or a hybrid combination of the two. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) from providers such as AWS and Microsoft Azure use a shared responsibility model where the provider delivers secure services such as compute, storage and networking, while the user is responsible for the security of the applications and the data. Our visibility solution enables organizations to address the visibility gap in their IaaS implementations by enabling them to extract data-in-motion and forward it to third party tools that provide content inspection to detect security threats, identify hot spots in application-to-application interactions, and use this transparency to mitigate risk and ensure compliance as they move workloads to the public cloud.
In addition to meeting the security, monitoring and performance needs of modern IT organizations, our Visibility Platform has been enhanced to provide mobile service providers with the ability to gain subscriber-aware visibility into their infrastructure. As 4G/LTE deployments gather momentum, mobile providers are grappling with the deluge of traffic flowing through their infrastructure and the corresponding costs of monitoring that infrastructure. Our solution allows service providers to correlate traffic to specific devices and subscribers and then deliver specifically selected subsets of that traffic to the multiple tool sets used in a typical mobile provider. Additional optimizations, including sampling and filtering can be executed on their network traffic, enabling a mobile provider to significantly reduce the cost of monitoring their networks.
Products and Technology
Our Visibility Platform is comprised of a range of custom software and applications that in combination reside on high-performance, modular purpose-built hardware, or run as virtual machines in private and public clouds. The traffic intelligence applications and capabilities provide advanced controls for traffic selection, forwarding, manipulation, modification, de-duplication, SSL decryption, correlation, sampling and generation of flow records. Our physical appliances are based upon a combination of commercially available hardware components, processing resources and storage devices. Centralized control across the Visibility Platform is provided by the GigaVUE-FM Fabric Manager software suite, our multi-node orchestration system.
These products enable our end-user customers to design and deploy Visibility Fabric architectures optimized for a range of scale and performance requirements from monitoring in virtualized server environments, and from 1 Gigabit appliances to multi-Terabit chassis-based solutions. The majority of our GigaVUE products are modular and extensible, enabling our Visibility Platform to be deployed on any size infrastructure and to scale as the environment grows.
Our product portfolio enables customers to deploy an architecture that delivers pervasive and active visibility to data-in-motion across their infrastructure. The product portfolio encompassed by the Visibility Platform has three major categories:

• | Visibility nodes powered by GigaVUE-OS software that offer a set of built-in services


• | Traffic Intelligence applications powered by GigaSMART

4


• | Orchestration engine powered by GigaVUE-FM

Collectively, the above components form a distributed set of physical and virtual visibility nodes that aggregate traffic, optimize traffic to precisely identify data of interest and deliver the data to interested applications/tools that consume this information.
Visibility Nodes: The visibility nodes in the Gigamon Visibility Platform can be physical appliances or, virtual appliances for both on-premise and public cloud IaaS.
GigaVUE physical visibility nodes are high-performance appliances that form the foundation of a distributed fabric. These hardware visibility nodes are modular and extensible for a range of scale and performance requirements from 1 Gigabit 1RU ("RackUnit") nodes to 2.4 Terabit-14RU chassis-based solutions. Our hardware visibility nodes are offered in two primary product lines:

• | GigaVUE H Series: These intelligent visibility nodes are offered in a variety of form factors optimized for different locations in the network ranging from branch offices/remote sites (GigaVUE-HB1 or GigaVUE-HC1) to highly demanding data centers / private clouds / mobile switching centers (GigaVUE-HC2, GigaVUE-HD4 or GigaVUE-HD8). A key characteristic of the GigaVUE H Series is integrated GigaSMART traffic intelligence and other custom hardware modules without the need for another discrete appliance.


• | GigaVUE TA Series: These nodes are traffic aggregators that collect network traffic from different segments of network infrastructure. The GigaVUE TA Series nodes are optimized for cost and do not support native GigaSMART traffic intelligence. However, by clustering GigaVUE-TA Series nodes with GigaVUE H Series nodes, GigaSMART traffic intelligence can be extended to traffic from ports that are physically resident on a GigaVUE TA Series node. This ability to mix-and-match multiple nodes allows flexible designs that maximize the reach of visibility without compromising the intelligence required for rich visibility.

Both the GigaVUE H Series and GigaVUE TA Series run a common operating system, GigaVUE-OS.
Visibility nodes may also be deployed in a software form factor (GigaVUE-VM) and are typically instantiated as virtual machines. GigaVUE-VM supports VMware ESXi, VMware NSX and OpenStack/KVM infrastructure. We are currently a design partner of VMware. Our visibility solution for VMware NSX is currently certified by VMware and features Service Composer integration to enable automated deployment of visibility when virtual networks are deployed with VMware NSX. 
For public cloud environments, a new type of visibility node (GigaVUE V Series) enables aggregation of traffic from virtual taps in the AWS public cloud. The GigaVUE V Series nodes will integrate the GigaSMART traffic intelligence applications. By combining the GigaVUE V Series deployments in the public cloud with our physical /virtual visibility nodes on-premise, organizations can gain pervasive visibility into their hybrid IT infrastructure while still managing the hybrid visibility infrastructure from a common orchestration layer (GigaVUE-FM). Our visibility solution for AWS is offered on a term basis, where the end-user customer purchases the offering for a specific duration based on the number of monitored points in its infrastructure. All other software products are offered as a perpetual license.
Access to network traffic to feed our visibility nodes is performed by:

• | Mirroring traffic from a network device using a SPAN (Switch Port Analyzer) session.


• | Using a physical test access point ("TAP"). We offer a broad range of passive and active TAPs. Our G-TAP series of TAPs provide non-intrusive access to physical traffic at various network interface speeds-1Gb (Copper or Fiber), 10Gb, 40Gb (including Cisco 40Gb BiDi) and 100Gb. Customers can deploy our G-TAP series products to provide economical connectivity between network traffic and the rest of the Visibility Platform. In 2015, we introduced a new series of modular, high-density 10Gb/40Gb/100Gb TAPs called the G-TAP M Series to address the growing demand for high-density TAP deployments.


• | Tapping into the underlying virtual switch in environments such as VMware ESXi and VMware NSX.


• | Using a virtual TAP agent. We offer a virtual TAP agent (“G-vTAP” agent) for OpenStack and public cloud (Amazon Web Services) environments when those environments do not provide the underlying facility to tap into the traffic. Traffic from these agents is aggregated by the GigaVUE V Series virtual aggregator.

Traffic Intelligence: Our traffic intelligence applications offered via the GigaSMART suite, enable organizations to profile, shape, refine and enhance the traffic before delivery to a security or management tool. Our GigaSMART applications are offered on purpose-built GigaVUE H Series appliances for optimal performance. Our V Series virtual appliances in the public cloud integrate a subset of GigaSMART applications.

Our GigaSMART suite of applications offers a number of significant benefits, including the ability to:

• | Extract data of interest from massive volumes of network traffic and minimize tool overload. Network traffic can be “searched” for specific signatures of interest to extract packets or entire sessions containing the data of interest.


• | Reduce unnecessary traffic. When traffic is monitored across different network segments, duplicate copies of the same network packet may be collected. Our de-duplication application eliminates redundant traffic that is not relevant to the task being performed, reducing wasted bandwidth, storage and processing resources.


• | Extract flow records and metadata. Many security tools (e.g. Security Information and Event Management tools) are not efficient in handling traffic feeds due to the overhead and cost of indexing. The NetFlow/IPFIX GigaSMART application, together with metadata extensions, addresses this pain point by generating flow records and metadata that is more easily consumed by such tools.


• | Enhance data privacy protection measures. GigaSMART applications such as slicing and masking are able to remove or obviate confidential or personal information and in doing so play an important role in ensuring data privacy.


• | Uncover blind spots. The "SSL Decryption" GigaSMART application is able to decrypt traffic that would normally be invisible to security and monitoring tools and in doing so uncovers blind spots and hidden risks within the data-in-motion. In February 2017, we announced a new feature enabling our customers to decrypt and encrypt SSL traffic 'in-line' of the production network. This new feature is scheduled to be generally available in April 2017.


• | Increase subscriber-aware visibility. Correlate traffic from split control and data planes (e.g. in a mobile network) to extract entire sessions corresponding to specific subscribers.

Orchestration engine: GigaVUE-FM is a software application that provides centralized orchestration and a common policy framework for deploying the Visibility Platform. GigaVUE-FM delivers a single pane-of-glass view of all the physical and virtual nodes across the Visibility Platform, while also providing an easy-to-use wizard-based approach for configuring our patented Flow Mapping and GigaSMART traffic policies.
In addition to centralized orchestration, GigaVUE-FM features fabric-wide reporting, scheduling capabilities, backup and restore functions and enhanced monitoring capabilities to proactively monitor and troubleshoot hot spots in the visibility infrastructure. Our GigaVUE-FM also features a broad range of out-of-the-box integrations with VMware vCenter, VMware NSX Manager, OpenStack, Amazon EC2 APIs, Amazon CloudWatch, as well as tools such as Splunk, Viavi and other customer applications. The open-standard REST Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs) form the basis of our programmable Software-Defined Visibility infrastructure. GigaVUE-FM is sold as a licensed product available at multiple tiers and can manage up to 250 discrete physical GigaVUE visibility (hardware) appliances and 1000s of virtualized visibility software nodes.
To complement our visibility nodes and software applications, we offer a range of supplemental components and accessories including modules, cables and transceivers. The transceivers are offered in a variety of form factors, including SFP, SFP+, QSFP+ and QSFP28.
Together, the various components in the Visibility Platform provide traffic aggregation, filtering, replication, traffic intelligence and orchestration capabilities to optimize traffic for the tools to better manage, secure and understand critical data-in-motion in a customer network. Changes can be made dynamically without impacting the production network so network, security and cloud operations teams can be agile and responsive to threats, events or anomalies on the network.

Customer Support
We offer ongoing technical support with our hardware and software products, including those sold directly to our end-user customers and through our channel partners. Our primary support offering provides two-tiered support levels, including premium-level support coverage. Certain channel partners offer their own additional support services to the end-user customer and then rely on our support organization for more complex support requests. We offer our end-user customers ongoing maintenance services for both hardware and software, which enable them to receive ongoing software updates, bug fixes and repairs. These services are sold to end-user customers typically for a one-year term at the time of the initial product sale, and customers may choose to renew for successive annual or multi-year periods. We also provide end-user customers with expedited replacement for any defective hardware. Our support personnel are based in Santa Clara, California, Reading, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and Singapore.
End-User Customers
As of December 31, 2016, we had over 2,300 end-user customers, including 81 of the Fortune 100 and 418 of the Fortune 1000. Our Visibility Platform can be used in a broad range of applications and has been adopted across many vertical markets including finance, high-speed trading, insurance, healthcare, higher education, government, e-commerce, technology, telecom and service providers. For fiscal 2016, one end-user customer, T-Mobile US, Inc., accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenue. No other end-user customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue during the periods presented.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our products directly through our own sales force and indirectly through our channel partners. We provide our channel partners with marketing assistance, technical training and support. 
We market and sell our products through a hybrid sales model, which combines a high-touch sales organization and an overlay channel sales team that actively assists our extensive network of channel partners throughout the sales process. We also provide our channel partners with marketing assistance, technical training and support. Our direct sales teams are typically comprised of a combination of one or more field sales representatives and a systems engineer. These teams also have access to a pool of shared inside sales and telemarketing representatives. Each sales team is responsible for a geographical territory, has responsibility for a number of major direct end-user customer accounts or has assigned accounts in a specific vertical market.
Our demand generation activities are focused on our target markets: primarily on Fortune 5000 organizations, federal agencies, large service providers and large and mid-sized enterprises. We also focus on ongoing account management for existing end-user customers and the development of follow-on sales as our existing end-user customers continue to expand and enhance their network infrastructure, increasing their demand for our solution. The majority of our North American sales are fulfilled by two of our existing channel partners, Global Convergence, Inc., or GCI, formerly Interlink Communications Systems, Inc., and Arrow Enterprise Computing Solutions, Inc., or Arrow. We also engaged Westcon as a North American distributor beginning in September, 2016.
For fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, GCI accounted for 33%, 40%, and 47% of our total revenue, respectively. For fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 Arrow accounted for 26%, 21%, and 16% of our total revenue, respectively. 
To access potential end-user customers worldwide, our direct sales force is distributed across our offices in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, India, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, and through a localized presence in many other countries.
Our marketing strategy is focused on increasing the awareness of, and driving end-user customer demand for, our Visibility Platform. We execute on this strategy by leveraging a combination of internal marketing professionals, external marketing agencies and a network of ecosystem and channel partners to effectively communicate the value proposition, differentiation and advantages of our solution, thereby generating qualified leads for our sales force and channel partners. We focus our resources on a variety of marketing vehicles, including trade shows, online advertising, content syndication, public relations, industry research, our website and collaborative relationships with technology vendors.

Backlog
 Product backlog includes orders for products scheduled to be shipped within 90 days to customers with approved credit status, and is net of service revenue allocations and any rebates and discounts. Because of the generally short cycle between order and shipment and occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders (which are made without significant penalty), we do not believe that our product backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily indicative of actual product revenue for any future period. A significant portion of our product revenue comes from orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter. Our product backlog at December 31, 2016, the last day of fiscal 2016, was $3.1 million. Our product backlog as of December 26, 2015, the last day of fiscal 2015, was $8.4 million. Our product backlog as of December 27, 2014, the last day of fiscal 2014, was $12.2 million. 
Technology Partners
We have ongoing non-exclusive relationships with a number of leading vendors of network management, analysis, compliance and security tools, including arrangements with Check Point Software Technologies Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., CA, Inc., Dynatrace Corporation, ExtraHop, ForeScout Technologies, Inc., Fortinet, Inc., FireEye, Inc., Imperva, Inc., LightCyber, LogRhythm, Inc., Palo Alto Networks, Inc., Plixer International, Inc., RSA (the Security Division of EMC Corporation), Riverbed Technology, Inc., Savvius, Inc., SevOne, Inc., SolarWinds Inc., Splunk Inc, VMware, Inc., and Viavi Solutions Inc., some of which include the joint development of use-case and reference architectures that enhance the performance and efficiency of the end-user customer’s infrastructure. We expect to continue adding more technology partners and to publish joint case studies with these partners following end-user deployment and approval. In addition to joint development of reference designs and case studies, we have undertaken various joint-marketing activities and events to drive interest and awareness of the combined solution as well as the power of visibility in our solution. As our solution helps optimize the efficiency of our tool partners’ management, analysis, compliance and security tools, we believe these vendors improve awareness at end-user customers of our solution and create new deployment opportunities.
Research and Development
We believe continued investments in research and development is critical to our business. Our research and development efforts focus on improving and enhancing our existing products and services, as well as developing new products, features and functionality. We believe that our custom software is critical to expanding our leadership position within the traffic visibility market. As a result, we devote the majority of our research and development resources to software development. Our engineering team has deep expertise in key areas related to our research and development efforts, including network security, network analysis and management technologies, virtualization, network protocol and Ethernet system design. We work closely with our end-user customers to understand their current and future needs and have designed a product development process that captures and integrates feedback from our end-user customers.
We believe the timely development of new products is essential to maintaining our competitive position. As of December 31, 2016, we had 270 employees in our research and development organization, with the majority located at our headquarters in California and the majority of the remaining employees located at our new facility in Chennai, India. We also test our products to certify and ensure interoperability with third party hardware and software products. We plan to prioritize and dedicate significant resources to these continued research and development efforts. Our research and development expenses were $68.1 million, or 22% of our revenue in fiscal 2016, $49.6 million, or 22% of our revenue, in fiscal 2015, and $42.8 million, or 27% of our revenue, in fiscal 2014. Research and development expenses included stock-based compensation of $12.8 million, $9.1 million, and $8.1 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We outsource the manufacturing, systems assembly, testing and order fulfillment of our hardware products to third party contract manufacturers, original design manufacturers and third party logistics providers. Jabil Circuit, Inc., or Jabil and Delta Networks International Ltd., or DNI manufacture and, through joint design arrangements with us, develop substantially all of our hardware products. We also contract with Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. or Expeditors International, to provide warehousing, packaging, order fulfillment and light manufacturing services for our products beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. In the assembly of our products, we utilize components from many suppliers. Whenever possible, we strive to have multiple sources for these components to ensure continuous supply. However, we have limited sources of supply for certain components that are technically unique or in high demand, and we have not entered into supply agreements with many of these suppliers. In such cases, we seek to maintain a close direct relationship with the suppliers to ensure supply is adequate and that the components meet our quality requirements. In certain instances, we have entered into 
8

license agreements with sole-source suppliers, allowing us to incorporate certain of their components into our hardware products.
We entered into an updated manufacturing services agreement with Jabil in April 2015, pursuant to which Jabil manufactures, tests, configures, assembles, packages and ships our products. The initial term was one year, with the term automatically renewing for additional one-year term unless terminated by either party by giving at least six months' written notice before the end of the then-current term. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement (i) for convenience upon nine months written notice by Jabil or six months written notice by us, (ii) for cause upon written notice of a material breach and if the other party does not cure such breach within 30 days of such notice, (iii) immediately upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party, or (iv) upon a change of control of either party, subject to applicable notice periods.
Finally, we have entered into a license and services agreement with Tall Maple Systems, Inc., or Tall Maple, pursuant to which we have been granted a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide license to certain software code of Tall Maple which we integrate into the software component of our H Series products and which can be integrated into our other products and applications. In return, we paid Tall Maple a license fee. The agreement can only be terminated for cause upon written notice of a material breach and if the other party does not cure such breach within 30 days of such notice.
Competition
The markets in which we compete are highly competitive. We expect competition to intensify in the future as existing competitors bundle new and more competitive offerings with their existing products and services, and as new market entrants introduce new products into our markets.
We compete either directly or indirectly with certain Ethernet switch vendors, such as Cisco Systems, Inc., Brocade Communications Systems, Inc. and Arista Networks, Inc., and network management, analysis, compliance and security tool vendors, such as Netscout and Ixia, which recently announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Keysight Technologies, Inc., that offer point solutions that address a portion of the issues that we solve. In the future, we expect to compete with new market entrants, which may include our joint-development partners or other current technology partners.
The principal competitive factors applicable to our products include: 
•functionality and performance;
•price and total cost of ownership;
•ease of use;
•flexibility and scalability of deployment;
•brand awareness;
•product reliability and quality;
•interoperability with other products;
•the extent and speed of user adoption; and
•quality of service, support and fulfillment.
Although we believe that we compete favorably with respect to the above factors, we believe that other competitors may emerge with new technological approaches to the problems we solve, greater name recognition, longer operating histories, well-established relationships with end-user customers or channel partners in our markets, broader product portfolios, the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services, larger intellectual property portfolios and substantially greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources than we have. We expect competition and competitive pressure, from both new and existing competitors, to increase in the future.
Intellectual Property
To protect our intellectual property, we rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws. As of December 31, 2016, we had 35 issued patents that expire between 2025 and 2033, and 30 pending patent applications in the United States. Internationally, as of December 31, 2016 we had 9 issued patents and a number of pending patent applications. The claims for which we have sought patent protection relate primarily to system architecture, traffic visibility technology, traffic control, monitoring and management, and filtering technology we 
9

have developed. We also license software from third parties for integration into our products, including open source software and other commercially available software.
As part of our strategy to protect our proprietary technologies and our intellectual property rights from unauthorized parties that may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use our trade secrets or other confidential information, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, channel partners and end-user customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information and proprietary technology.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 684 employees, including 270 in research and development, 297 in sales and marketing, 48 in manufacturing and support and 69 in general and administrative functions. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or is a party to any collective bargaining arrangement in connection with his or her employment with us. We have never experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
