ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
-------------------

General 
 Barnes & Noble, Inc. (Barnes & Noble or the Company), one of the nations largest booksellers,1 provides customers a unique experience across its multi-channel distribution platform. As of April 29, 2017, the Company operates 633 bookstores in 50 states, maintains an eCommerce site, develops digital reading products and operates NOOK, one of the largest digital bookstores. Barnes & Noble is utilizing the strength of its retail footprint in combination with its online and digital businesses to provide an omni-channel experience for its customers, fulfilling its commitment to offer customers any book, anytime, anywhere and in any format. 
 Barnes & Noble Retail (B&N Retail) operates 633 retail bookstores, primarily under the Barnes & Noble Booksellers® trade name, and includes the Companys eCommerce site. B&N Retail also includes Sterling Publishing Co., Inc. (Sterling or Sterling Publishing), a leader in general trade book publishing. The NOOK segment represents the Companys digital business, offering digital books and magazines for sale and consumption online, NOOK®2 reading devices, co-branded NOOK® tablets and reading software for iOS, Android and Windows. The Company employed approximately 26,000 employees (11,000 full-time and 15,000 part-time employees) as of April 29, 2017. 
 The Companys principal business is the sale of trade books (generally hardcover and paperback titles), mass market paperbacks (such as mystery, romance, science fiction and other popular fiction), childrens books, eBooks and other digital content, NOOK® and related accessories, bargain books, magazines, gifts, café products and services, educational toys & games, music and movies direct to customers through its bookstores or on www.barnesandnoble.com. The Company offers its customers a full suite of textbook options (new, used, digital and rental). 
 Recently, Barnes & Noble has experienced declining sales trends due primarily to lower store traffic and the challenging retail environment. Despite sales declines, the Company has been able to sustain profit levels on cost reductions. 
 While the Company believes it has lost share on its recent sales performance, it also sees opportunities in an industry that has become more stable. 
 To grow sales, the Company will leverage the strength of its Barnes & Noble brand, knowledgeable booksellers, vast selections and retail footprint to attract customers to its omni-channel offerings. Merchandising initiatives are focused on increasing the number of value offers, improving SKU productivity, improving inventory management processes, testing changes to existing store layouts and remerchandising select business units in stores. The Company believes there is opportunity to increase conversion by improving navigation and discovery throughout the store, including a customer friendly and more intuitive organization of books and improved signage for easier browsing within and across sections. 
 In-store events also drive traffic, reinforcing Barnes & Noble as a community center where customers can meet, browse and discover. The Company is also utilizing social media, where booksellers communicate events, promotions and new product offerings with customers at the local level.

In addition to initiatives focused on growing sales through its existing store base, the Company is also testing new bookstore formats, which it believes could foster sales growth in the future. 
 BN.com and NOOK are important components of the Companys omni-channel strategy. The Company believes that in the long term, enhancements to its BN.com platform will enable it to be more competitive in the marketplace. The Company continues to improve its overall eCommerce user experience across channels, including desktop, tablet, mobile and app based, with the goal of providing a great device agnostic user experience. For customers interested in eBooks, the Company continues to judiciously bring new NOOK devices and apps to market. 
 The Companys Membership program provides the Company with valuable data and insights into its customer base, enabling the Company to better understand and market to its customers. Members are more productive than Non-Members, as they spend more and visit more often. The Company continues to test programs to grow sales to both Members and Non-Members, increase Membership, improve price perception and enhance its overall customer value proposition. 
 In light of the declining sales trends, the Company remains committed to right sizing its cost structure. The Company is focused on simplification throughout its organization to create efficiencies and reinvest resources to support sales growth. At B&N Retail, the Company is focused on increasing store and supply chain productivity, streamlining operations and eliminating non-productive spend. At NOOK, the Company exited non-core businesses and outsourced certain functions, which enabled it to close its Santa Clara, CA and Taipei offices. NOOK expects to continue to re-calibrate its cost structure commensurate with sales, further reducing its losses. 
 Separation of Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. 
 On February 26, 2015, Barnes & Noble announced plans for the legal and structural separation of Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. (Barnes & Noble Education or B&N Education) (formerly known as NOOK Media Inc.) from Barnes & Noble into an independent public company (the Spin-Off). 
 On July 14, 2015, the Barnes & Noble board of directors (the Board) approved the final distribution ratio and declared a pro rata dividend of the outstanding shares of B&N Education common stock, which resulted in the complete legal and structural separation of the two companies. The distribution was subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions as set forth in B&N Educations Registration Statement on Form S-1, which was filed with the SEC on February 26, 2015 and was amended on April 29, 2015, June 4, 2015, June 29, 2015, July 13, 2015, July 14, 2015 and July 15, 2015. 
 On August 2, 2015, Barnes & Noble completed the Spin-Off of Barnes & Noble Education and distributed, on a pro rata basis, all of the shares of B&N Education common stock to the Companys stockholders of record as of July 27, 2015. These Barnes & Noble stockholders of record as of July 27, 2015 received a distribution of 0.632 shares of B&N Education common stock for each share of Barnes & Noble common stock held as of the record date. Immediately following the completion of the Spin-Off, the Companys stockholders owned 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of B&N Education. Following the Spin-Off, B&N Education operates as an independent public company and as the parent of Barnes & Noble College, trading on New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BNED. 
 In connection with the separation of B&N Education, the Company and B&N Education entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement on July 14, 2015 and several other ancillary agreements on August 2, 2015. These agreements govern the relationship between the Company and B&N Education after the separation and allocate between the Company and B&N Education various assets, liabilities, rights and obligations following the separation, including employee benefits, intellectual property, information technology, insurance and tax-related assets and liabilities. The agreements also describe the Companys future commitments to provide B&N Education with certain transition services.

This Spin-Off is expected to be a non-taxable event for Barnes & Noble and its shareholders, and Barnes & Nobles U.S. shareholders (other than those subject to special rules) generally will not recognize gain or loss as a result of the distribution of B&N Education shares. 
 History of Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. 
 On September 30, 2009, Barnes & Noble acquired Barnes & Noble College Booksellers, LLC (B&N College) from Leonard and Louise Riggio. From that date until October 4, 2012, B&N College was wholly owned by Barnes & Noble Booksellers, Inc. B&N Education was initially incorporated under the name NOOK Media Inc. in July 2012 to hold Barnes & Nobles B&N College and NOOK digital businesses. On October 4, 2012, Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) acquired a 17.6% non-controlling preferred membership interest in B&N Educations subsidiary B&N Education, LLC (formerly NOOK Media LLC) (the LLC), and through B&N Education, Barnes & Noble maintained an 82.4% controlling interest of the B&N College and NOOK digital businesses. 
 On January 22, 2013, Pearson Education, Inc. (Pearson) acquired a 5% non-controlling preferred membership interest in the LLC, entered into a commercial agreement with the LLC relating to the B&N College business and received warrants to purchase an additional preferred membership interest in the LLC. 
 On December 4, 2014, B&N Education re-acquired Microsofts interest in the LLC in exchange for cash and common stock of Barnes & Noble and the Microsoft commercial agreement was terminated effective as of such date. On December 22, 2014, B&N Education also re-acquired Pearsons interest in the LLC and certain related warrants previously issued to Pearson. In connection with these transactions, Barnes & Noble entered into contingent payment agreements with Microsoft and Pearson providing for additional payments upon the occurrence of certain events, including upon a sale of the NOOK digital business. As a result of these transactions, Barnes & Noble owned, prior to the Spin-Off, 100% of B&N Education. 
 On May 1, 2015, B&N Education distributed to Barnes & Noble all of the membership interests in B&N Educations NOOK digital business. As a result, B&N Education ceased to own any interest in the NOOK digital business, which remains a wholly owned subsidiary of Barnes & Noble. 
 Discontinued Operations of Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. 
 The Company has recognized the separation of B&N Education in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 205-20, Discontinued Operations. As such, the historical results of Barnes & Noble Education for fiscal 2015 have been adjusted to include pre-spin B&N Education results and separation-related costs and exclude corporate allocations with B&N Retail, and have been classified as discontinued operations. Additionally, discontinued operations for fiscal 2016 included investment banking fees (as they directly related to the Spin-Off), as well as pre-spin B&N Education results and separation-related costs, and excluded corporate allocation adjustments with B&N Retail. 
Series J Preferred Stock 
 On August 18, 2011, the Company entered into an investment agreement between the Company and Liberty GIC, Inc. (Liberty), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to Liberty, and Liberty purchased, 204,000 shares of the Companys Series J Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (Preferred Stock), for an aggregate purchase price of $204.0 million in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act. The shares of Preferred Stock were convertible, at the option of the holders, into shares of Common Stock representing 16.6% of the Common Stock

 outstanding as of August 29, 2011 (after giving pro forma effect to the issuance of the Preferred Stock) based on the initial conversion rate. The initial conversion rate reflected an initial conversion price of $17.00 and was subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The initial dividend rate for the Preferred Stock was equal to 7.75% per annum of the initial liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock paid quarterly and subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
 On April 8, 2014, Liberty sold the majority of its shares to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and had retained an approximate 10% stake of its initial investment. As a result, Liberty no longer had the right to elect two preferred stock directors to the Companys Board. Additionally, the consent rights and pre-emptive rights, to which Liberty was previously entitled, ceased to apply. 
 On June 5, 2015, the Company entered into conversion agreements with five beneficial owners (Series J Holders) of its Preferred Stock, pursuant to which each of the Series J Holders had agreed to convert (Conversion) shares of Preferred Stock it beneficially owned into shares of the Companys common stock, par value $0.001 per share (Company Common Stock), and additionally received a cash payment from the Company in connection with the Conversion.
 On July 9, 2015, the Company completed the Conversion. Pursuant to the terms of the Conversion Agreements, the Series J Holders converted an aggregate of 103,995 shares of Preferred Stock into 6,117,342 shares of Company Common Stock, and made an aggregate cash payment to the Series J Holders of $3.7 million plus cash in lieu of fractional shares in connection with the Conversion. 
 On July 10, 2015, the Company gave notice of its exercise of the right to force conversion of all outstanding shares of its Senior Convertible Redeemable Series J Preferred Stock into Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 9 of the Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Relative Participating, Optional and Other Special Rights and Qualifications, Limitations and Restrictions of Series J Preferred Stock, dated as of August 18, 2011 (the Forced Conversion). The effective date of the Forced Conversion was July 24, 2015. On the date of the Forced Conversion, each share of Series J Preferred Stock was automatically converted into 59.8727 shares of Company Common Stock, which included shares of Company Common Stock reflecting accrued and unpaid dividends on Series J Preferred Stock. Each holder of Series J Preferred Stock received whole shares of Company Common Stock and a cash amount in lieu of fractional shares of Company Common Stock. 
 As a result of the transactions described above, all shares of Series J Preferred Stock were retired by the Company and are no longer outstanding. 
 The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1986. 
 Segments 
 The Company identifies its operating segments based on the way the business is managed (focusing on the financial information distributed) and the manner in which the chief operating decision maker interacts with other members of management and makes decisions on the allocation of resources. The Companys two operating segments are B&N Retail and NOOK. 
 B&N Retail 
 This segment includes 633 bookstores as of April 29, 2017, primarily under the Barnes & Noble Booksellers trade name. These Barnes & Noble stores generally offer a comprehensive trade book title base, a café, and departments dedicated to Juvenile, Toys & Games, DVDs, Music & Vinyl, Gift, Magazine, Bargain products and a dedicated NOOK® area. The stores also offer a calendar of ongoing events, including author appearances and childrens activities. The B&N Retail segment also includes the Companys eCommerce website, www.barnesandnoble.com, and its publishing operation, Sterling Publishing.

Barnes & Noble stores range in size from 3,000 to 60,000 square feet depending upon market size, with an overall average store size of 26,000 square feet. In fiscal 2017, the Company reduced the Barnes & Noble store base by approximately 199,000 square feet, bringing the total square footage to 16.7 million square feet, a net reduction of 1.2% from fiscal 2016. 
 The Company believes that the key elements contributing to the success of B&N Retail are: 
 Proximity to Customers. The Companys strategy has been to increase its share of the consumer book market, as well as to increase the size of the market through a market clustering strategy. As of April 29, 2017, Barnes & Noble had stores in 161 of the total 210 Designated Market Area markets. In 68 of the 161 markets, the Company has only one Barnes & Noble store. The Company believes its bookstores proximity to its customers strengthens its market position and increases the value of its brand. Most Barnes & Noble stores are located in high-traffic areas with convenient access to major commercial thoroughfares and ample parking. Most stores offer extended shopping hours seven days a week. 
 Extensive Title Selection. Each Barnes & Noble store features an authoritative selection of books, ranging from 22,000 to 163,000 titles. The comprehensive title selection is diverse and reflects local interests and regional titles and authors works. Bestsellers typically represent between approximately 4% and 6% of Barnes & Noble store sales. Complementing this extensive on-site selection, all Barnes & Noble stores provide customers with access to the millions of books available to online shoppers at www.barnesandnoble.com by offering an option to have the book sent to the store or shipped directly to the customer. Additionally, the website allows customers to purchase over four million eBooks, newspapers and magazines. The Company believes that its tremendous selection, including many otherwise hard-to-find titles, builds customer loyalty. 
 Store Design and Ambiance. Many of the Barnes & Noble stores create a comfortable atmosphere with ample public space, a café offering sandwiches, soups and bakery items, among other things, and public restrooms. The cafés, for which the Starbucks Corporation is the sole provider of coffee products, foster the image of the stores as a community meeting place. In addition, the Company continues to develop and introduce new product line extensions, such as proprietary gifts and B&N Educator Program, providing education tools for teachers, librarians and parents. These offerings and services have helped to make many of the stores neighborhood institutions. 
 NOOK® Boutique/Counter. The Company has utilized its traditional retail bookstores to promote NOOK® within the bookstores. Customers have the ability to see, feel, and experiment with NOOK®, speak to knowledgeable booksellers, and receive pre- and post-sales customer support within the Companys bookstores. The Company offers NOOK® owners Always Free NOOK® Support in all of its retail bookstores, as well as free Wi-Fi connectivity to enjoy the Read In Store feature to read NOOK Books for free. These acclaimed devices, which provide a fun, easy-to-use and immersive reading experience, include the NOOK® Tablet, Samsung Galaxy Tab® A NOOK®, Samsung Galaxy Tab® S2 NOOK®, Samsung Galaxy Tab® E NOOK® and NOOK GlowLight Plus devices. The NOOK® devices have also opened up an additional market for NOOK®-related accessories such as stands, covers, lights, and other items. Through our NOOK in Education program, the retail bookstores provide support and service to schools and educators who deploy NOOK® devices in their classrooms. 
 Educational Toys & Games Department. Barnes & Noble continues to expand in the educational toys and games category with a uniquely curated offering of best in class products from around the world. With its focus on education, customers can browse and engage in monthly hands-on learning events celebrating self-expression through arts and crafts, critical thinking skills through construction, even exploring scientific discoveries. The Educational Toys & Games Department at Barnes & Noble offers an experiential retail space where parents and gift-givers can shop in three distinct ways: by brand, by category and by age.

Specialty Games, Hobby & Collectibles. Barnes & Noble, in recognition of its customers interests, passions and pastimes, has expanded and will continue to explore the specialty, hobby, craft and collectibles category bringing a recognizable, authentic merchandising assortment together to complement its growing specialty games and puzzle area. 
 Music and Movies & TV Departments. Many of the Barnes & Noble stores have Music and Movies & TV departments, which offer CDs, Vinyl LPs, DVDs and Blu-ray discs. These departments range in size from approximately 300 to 8,000 square feet and typically stock approximately 10,000 titles. The Companys DVD and Blu-ray selection focuses on current and classic movies, documentaries, fitness and instructional titles, British TV series and movies, and foreign films. The music selection is tailored to the tastes of the Companys customers, centering on classical music, jazz, pop rock, and show tunes. The Company also offers a strong selection of Vinyl titles, available in all stores, along with turntables. 
 Discount Pricing. Barnes & Noble stores employ an aggressive nationwide discount pricing strategy and offer special promotions throughout the year. The Barnes & Noble Member Program offers members greater discounts and other benefits for products and services as well as exclusive offers and promotions via email or direct mail. The Companys website, www.barnesandnoble.com, also utilizes a competitive model that includes everyday low pricing as well as various promotional offerings designed for members and non-members alike and enables the Company to offer better value to its customers. The Barnes & Noble Kids Club Program offers free rewards and special offers to participants and invites children to celebrate their birthday within the retail bookstores. 
 Community Business Development. The Companys retail bookstores host a variety of national and local events, which feature the many products and services it offers. Each store plans its own community-based calendar of events, including author appearances, childrens storytimes, poetry readings and book discussion groups. In addition, the Company hosts a number of national campaigns around various themes or audiences such as Get Pop-Cultured with Barnes & Noble, Summer Reading, My Favorite Teacher Essay Contest, Educator Appreciation Days, the annual Holiday Book Drive, which provides books to at risk children in the communities the stores serve, and Maker Faire, all of which increase traffic and sales and further reinforce Barnes & Noble as a community center. 
 The Company also provides fund-raising opportunities through its Bookfair program for schools and local non-profit arts and literacy organizations, as well as a Holiday Gift Wrap program, which allows non-profit organizations to gain exposure and raise funds while wrapping gifts inside the stores. The Company believes its community business development programs encourage customer loyalty, drive sales and traffic into its stores and provide positive publicity and media coverage. 
 Merchandising and Marketing. The Companys merchandising strategy for its Barnes & Noble stores is to be the authoritative community bookstore carrying an extensive selection of titles in all subjects, including an extensive selection of titles from small independent publishers and university presses. Each Barnes & Noble store features an extensive selection of books from 22,000 to 163,000 unique titles, of which approximately 27,000 titles are common to virtually all stores. Each store is tailored to reflect the lifestyles and interests of the areas customers. 
 Product Master, the Companys proprietary inventory database, has approximately 19.0 million titles. It includes approximately 7.3 million active titles and provides each store with comprehensive title selections. By enhancing the Companys existing merchandise replenishment systems, Product Master allows the Company to achieve higher in-stock positions and better productivity at the bookstore level through efficiencies in receiving, cashiering and returns processing. Complementing this extensive on-site selection, all Barnes & Noble stores provide customers with access to the millions of books available to online shoppers at www.barnesandnoble.com by offering an option to have the book sent to the store or shipped directly to the customer.

The Company has a multi-channel eCommerce marketing strategy that deploys various merchandising programs and promotional activities to drive traffic to both its stores and website. At the center of this eCommerce program is the Companys website, www.barnesandnoble.com. The website serves as both the Companys direct-to-home delivery service and as an important broadcast channel and advertising medium for the Barnes & Noble brand. For example, the online store locator at www.barnesandnoble.com receives millions of customer visits each year providing store hours, directions, information about author events and other in-store activities. Similarly, in Barnes & Noble stores, NOOK® customers can access free Wi-Fi connectivity, enjoy the Read In Store feature to browse many complete eBooks for free. 
 Since launching its new website in June 2015, the Company has implemented a number of website fixes to address post-launch issues that reduced website traffic and conversion, as well as to improve the overall user experience. BN.com is an important component of the Companys omni-channel strategy, and it believes that, in the long-term, the new platform will enable it to be more competitive in the marketplace. 
 Another example of a multi-channel initiative is the Barnes & Noble MasterCard®, a co-brand credit card issued by Barclaycard. Card members earn 5% back on purchases at any Barnes & Noble stores or online at www.barnesandnoble.com. They also earn points for every dollar spent on purchases where MasterCard is accepted (excluding Barnes & Noble purchases); when they reach 2,500 points, they automatically earn a $25 Barnes & Noble gift card. Customers can apply in any B&N store or online at BN.com. Upon approval, they can use the new account to receive the 5% statement credit rebate on their B&N purchase, as well as a $25 Barnes & Noble gift card after first use of the account.
 The Company believes that its website complements its bookstores in many ways. It not only serves as a marketing tool, it offers convenient shopping alternatives for its customers. 
 Store Locations and Properties. The Companys experienced real estate personnel select sites for new Barnes & Noble stores after an extensive review of demographic data and other information relating to market potential, bookstore visibility and access, available parking, surrounding businesses, compatible nearby tenants, competition and the location of other Barnes & Noble stores. Most stores are located in high-visibility areas adjacent to main traffic corridors in strip shopping centers, freestanding buildings and regional shopping malls. The real estate personnel continue to focus on renegotiating leases as they expire.

Sterling Publishing 
 Sterling Publishing is a leading publisher of non-fiction trade titles. Founded in 1949, Sterling publishes a wide range of non-fiction and illustrated books and kits across a variety of imprints, in categories such as health & wellness, music & popular culture, food & wine, crafts, puzzles & games, coloring books and history & current affairs, as well as a large childrens line. Sterling, with a solid backlist and robust value publishing program, has a title base of approximately 15,000 eBooks and print books. In addition, Sterling also distributes approximately 1,100 titles on behalf of client publishers. 
Operations 
 The Company has seasoned management teams for its retail stores, including those for real estate, merchandising and store operations. Field management includes regional vice presidents and district managers supervising multiple store locations. 
 The Barnes & Noble management team is led by experienced management in both traditional product lines and in digital eCommerce. The Barnes & Noble management team employs highly skilled professionals with both media expertise and supply chain management skills. This combination ensures a positive customer experience regardless of a customers preference for a physical product or a digital one. 
 
11 
 
Each Barnes & Noble store generally employs a store manager, two assistant store managers, two merchandise managers, a café manager, a receiving manager and on average 30 booksellers (combination of full-time and part-time). Many Barnes & Noble stores also employ a full-time community business development manager. The large bookseller base provides the Company with experienced employees to fill new manager positions in the Companys Barnes & Noble stores. The Company anticipates that a significant percentage of the personnel required to manage its stores will continue to come from within its existing operations. 
 Field management for all of the Companys bookstores, including regional vice presidents, district managers and store managers, participate in an annual incentive program tied to store productivity. The Company believes that the compensation of its field management is competitive with that offered by other specialty retailers of comparable size. 
 Barnes & Noble has in-store training programs providing specific information needed for success at each level, beginning with the entry-level positions of bookseller. District managers participate in annual training and merchandising conferences. Store managers are generally responsible for training other booksellers and employees in accordance with detailed procedures and guidelines prescribed by the Company utilizing a blended learning approach, including on-the-job training, eLearning, facilitator-led training and training aids available at each bookstore. 
 Purchasing 
 Barnes & Nobles buyers negotiate costs on select items, marketing funds, promotional discounts, cooperative advertising and showroom allowances with publishers and other suppliers for www.barnesandnoble.com and all of the Companys bookstores. The Company has buyers who specialize in customizing inventory for bookselling in stores and online. Store inventories are further customized by store managers, who may respond to local demand by purchasing a limited amount of fast-selling titles through a nationwide wholesaling network, including the Companys distribution centers. 
 The Companys B&N Retail segment purchases physical books on a regular basis from nearly 500 publishers and over 40 wholesalers or distributors. Purchases from the top five suppliers (including publishers, wholesalers and distributors) accounted for approximately 65% of the B&N Retails book purchases during fiscal 2017, and no single supplier accounted for more than 27% of B&N Retails book purchases during this period. Consistent with industry practice, a substantial majority of the physical book purchases are returnable for full credit, a practice which substantially reduces the Companys risk of inventory obsolescence. 
 Publishers periodically offer their excess inventory in the form of remainder books to book retailers and wholesalers through an auction process, which generally favors booksellers such as the Company, who are able to buy substantial quantities. These books are generally purchased in large quantities at favorable prices and are then sold to consumers at significant discounts off publishers list prices. 
 Distribution 
 The Company has invested significant capital in its systems and technology by building new platforms, implementing new software applications and building and maintaining efficient distribution centers. This investment has enabled the Company to source a majority of its inventory through its own distribution centers, resulting in direct buying from vendors rather than wholesalers. Using the Companys own distribution centers rather than wholesalers lowers distribution costs per unit, increases inventory turns, and improves product margins. The Companys distribution centers 3-prong strategy of 
 
12 
 
 (1) accelerating speed to market, (2) improving order quality (on-time, complete and damage free) and (3) reducing costs has improved just-in-time deliveries to stores as well as deliveries to the Companys customers on orders placed via the Barnes & Noble website and through the Companys in-store order network. 
 As of April 29, 2017, the Company has approximately 1,745,000 square feet of distribution center capacity. The Company has an approximately 1,145,000 square foot distribution center in Monroe Township, New Jersey, which ships merchandise to stores throughout the country and to online customers. The Company also has an approximately 600,000 square foot distribution center in Reno, Nevada, which is used to facilitate distribution to stores and online customers in the western United States. 
 Information Technologies 
 The Company has focused a majority of its information technology resources on strategically positioning and implementing systems to support store operations, online technology requirements, merchandising, distribution, marketing and finance.
 BookMaster, the Companys proprietary bookstore inventory management system, integrates point-of-sale features with a proprietary data warehouse-based replenishment system. BookMaster enhances communications and real-time access to the Companys network of bookstores, distribution centers and wholesalers. The Company continues to implement systems to improve efficiencies in back office processing in the human resources, finance and merchandising areas. 
 The Company plans to continue to invest in technologies that will enable it to offer its customers the more convenient and user-friendly online shopping experience. B&N Retail has licensed existing commercial technology when available and has focused its internal development efforts on those proprietary systems necessary to provide the highest level of service to its customers. The overall mix of technologies and applications allows the Company to support a distributed, scalable and secure eCommerce environment. 
 The Company uses Intel®-based server technology in a fully redundant configuration to power its current website, which is hosted in two Company-owned locations. Each of these sites has sufficient capacity to independently support the volume of traffic directed toward the Companys website during peak periods. Both hosting locations are configured with redundant power, Internet telecommunications capacity and cooling to significantly reduce its exposure to downtime and service outages. Additionally, the Company believes its technology investments are scalable to meet the future growth demands of the business. 
 Competition 
 The book business is highly competitive in every channel in which Barnes & Noble operates. B&N Retail stores compete primarily on the quality of the shopping and store experience and the price and availability of products. The importance of price varies depending on the competitor, with some of Barnes & Nobles competitors engaging in significant discounting and other promotional activities. B&N Retail competes with other bookstores, including Books-A-Million. It also faces competition from many online businesses, notably Amazon.com and Apple. Increases in consumer spending via the Internet may significantly affect its ability to generate sales in B&N Retail stores. B&N Retail also faces competition from mass merchandisers, such as Costco, Target and Wal-Mart. Some of the Companys competitors have greater financial and other resources and different business strategies than B&N Retail does. B&N Retail stores also compete with specialty retail stores that offer books in particular subject areas, independent store operators, variety discounters, drug stores, warehouse clubs, mail-order clubs and other retailers offering books, music, toys, games, gifts and other products in its market segments.

The music and movie businesses are also highly competitive and the Company faces competition from mass merchants, discounters and electronic distribution. The store experience is geared towards the Companys customer base, including a strong Blu-ray presence as well as a tailored, returnable product assortment. 
 Seasonality 
 The B&N Retail business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of sales and operating income realized during its third fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. 
Employees 
 The Company cultivates a culture of outgoing, helpful and knowledgeable employees. As of April 29, 2017, the B&N Retail segment had approximately 26,000 employees (11,000 full-time and 15,000 part-time employees) as of April 29, 2017. The B&N Retail segments employees are not represented by unions. 
NOOK 
 This segment represents the Companys digital business, including the development and support of the Companys NOOK® product offerings. The digital business includes digital content such as eBooks, digital newsstand and sales of NOOK® devices and accessories to B&N Retail. The underlying strategy of the NOOK business is to offer customers any digital book, newspaper or magazine, anytime, on any device. The Company remains committed to delivering to customers the best digital bookstore experience, providing easy access to Barnes & Nobles expansive digital collection of over four million eBooks, digital magazines and newspapers, while rationalizing its existing cost structure. As part of this commitment, the Company partners with Samsung to develop co-branded NOOK® tablets that feature the award-winning Barnes & Noble digital reading experience, while continuing to develop and offer its own black-and-white NOOK® eReaders. 
 Barnes & Nobles NOOK digital bookstore and Reading Apps provide customers the ability to purchase and read their digital content and access their Lifetime Library on a wide range of digital platforms, including Windows PCs and tablets, iPad, iPhone® , Android smartphones and tablets, PC and Mac®.

Operations 
 The digital products group has knowledgeable product development and operational management teams in the areas of reading software, digital content retailing and mobile device development. Digital product management oversees product concept, software development, engineering, and user experience. Operational management has historically overseen demand planning, strategic sourcing, manufacturing, return and refurbishment of hardware. The Company expects that digital product managements role will continue to focus on eReading devices and reading platforms, while also shifting to the management of third-party partner relationships, such as NOOKs partnership with Samsung. 
 On April 7, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Bahwan CyberTek (BCT), a global software products and services company, in which the Company outsourced certain NOOK functions, including cloud management and development support for NOOK® software. 
 The Companys development office employs experienced engineers in the Companys digital product area. The NOOK digital products management team is currently focused on next generation digital reading products to enhance the reading experience and help consumers discover content in new and interesting ways. The Digital Services team, which includes the Cloud and Commerce group, is responsible for maintaining and developing the NOOKs digital bookstore service.
 Purchasing/Distribution 
 NOOK acquires the rights to distribute digital content from publishers and distributes the content on www.barnesandnoble.com, NOOK® devices and other eBookstore platforms. Certain digital content is distributed under an agency pricing model, in which the publishers set fixed prices for eBooks and NOOK receives a fixed commission on content sold through the eBookstore. The majority of the Companys eBooks are sold under the agency model. 
 NOOK utilizes the Companys purchasing power and its distribution centers to synergistically facilitate the purchasing and shipping of devices and accessories.
 Competition 
 The eReader and tablet businesses are highly competitive. NOOK competes primarily on price, device functionality, consumer appeal and availability of digital content. The importance of price varies depending on the competitor, with some of NOOKs competitors engaging in significant discounting and other promotional activities. NOOK competes with many online digital businesses, notably Amazon.com and Apple. Some of the Companys competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources and may have different business strategies than NOOK does. 
Seasonality 
 The NOOK business, like that of many technology companies, is impacted by the launch of new products and the promotional efforts to support those new products, as well as the traditional retail holiday selling seasonality.
Employees 
 As of April 29, 2017, NOOK had 92 employees (combination of full-time and part-time). NOOK employees are not represented by unions, and the Company believes that its relationship with its employees is generally excellent.
