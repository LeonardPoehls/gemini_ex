ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Merger Agreement
On January 21, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Celgene Corp. and Blue Magpie Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celgene Corp. ("Purchaser"). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Purchaser has commenced a tender offer (the "Offer") for all of the outstanding shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $87.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, subject to reduction for any applicable withholding taxes (the "Offer Price"). Following the completion of the Offer and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Purchaser will merge with and into Juno, with Juno surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celgene Corp., pursuant to the procedures provided for under Section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") without any stockholder approvals (the "Merger"). At the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each outstanding share of our common stock, other than any shares owned by (i) Juno (or held in its treasury), (ii) Celgene Corp., Purchaser, or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Celgene Corp., or (iii) any stockholders who are entitled to and who properly exercise and perfect appraisal rights under Delaware law (and have neither withdrawn nor lost their rights), will be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price, without interest. The Juno board of directors (the "Board") has, by unanimous vote of those directors present, approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants of the parties customary for transactions of this type, including, among others, covenants obligating Juno to continue to conduct its business in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing. 
The Merger Agreement also includes covenants requiring Juno, subject in each case to certain exceptions, not to solicit, or engage in discussions with third parties relating to, alternative acquisition proposals during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing, or to withdraw or withhold (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Celgene Corp.) the recommendation of the Board that Juno stockholders tender their shares of our common stock to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. 
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights, including the right of either party to terminate the Merger Agreement if the Offer is not consummated on or before July 23, 2018 (subject to extension in certain circumstances), the right of Juno to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal for an alternative acquisition transaction (so long as Juno complies with certain notice and other requirements under the Merger Agreement) and the right of Celgene Corp. to terminate due to a change of recommendation by the Board. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement by Juno or Celgene Corp. upon certain conditions, a termination fee of $300 million may be payable by Juno to Celgene Corp. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement by Juno or Celgene Corp. under certain other conditions, a termination fee of $600 million may be payable by Celgene Corp. to Juno where the conditions to the Offer related to approvals under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), have not been satisfied.
Additional information about the Merger is set forth in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").
Overview
We are building a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Founded on the vision that the use of human cells as therapeutic entities will drive one of the next important phases in medicine, we are developing cell-based cancer immunotherapies based on our CAR and TCR technologies to genetically engineer T cells to recognize and kill cancer cells. Our most advanced product candidate, lisocabtagene maraleucel ("liso-cel"), also known as JCAR017, is in a potential registration trial for the treatment of relapsed or refractory ("r/r") diffuse large b cell lymphoma ("DLBCL"), and we began a Phase I/II trial with JCAR017 in r/r chronic lymphocytic leukemia ("CLL") in 2017. We have shown compelling clinical responses in clinical trials using multiple cell-based product candidates to address refractory B cell lymphomas and leukemias, and we also have a number of ongoing trials exploring our platform in multiple myeloma and solid-organ cancers and in combination with various strategies to overcome the immune-suppressive effects of cancer. In aggregate, we currently have product candidates in clinical trials targeting eight different protein targets in various cancers. Longer term, we aim to improve and leverage our cell-based platform to develop additional product candidates to address a broad range of cancers and human diseases, including moving forward our preclinical product candidates that target additional hematologic and solid-organ cancers.
Cancer is a leading cause of death in developed countries. Cancer is characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells. Cancer cells contain mutated proteins and may overexpress other proteins normally found in the body at low levels. The 
-3-

immune system typically recognizes abnormal protein expression and eliminates these cells in a highly efficient process known as immune surveillance. Cancer cells’ ability to evade immune surveillance is a key factor in their growth, spread, and persistence. In the last five years, there has been substantial scientific progress in countering these evasion mechanisms using immunotherapies, or therapies that activate the immune system. Immunotherapies are increasingly recognized as an important part of today’s frontier in the treatment of cancer. The most promising data for CAR-T cell therapies have been in DLBCL, CLL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia ("ALL"), and multiple myeloma. Together, these indications represent a significant unmet medical need, with a total of more than 158,000 patients diagnosed with these diseases annually in the United States and the European Union.
A central player in cancer immunotherapy is a type of white blood cell known as the T cell. In healthy individuals, T cells identify and kill infected or abnormal cells, including cancer cells. We leverage two technologies-CARs and TCRs-to activate a patient’s own T cells so that they attack cancer cells. Through genetic engineering, we insert a gene for a particular CAR or TCR construct into the T cell that enables it to recognize cancer cells. Our CAR technology directs T cells to recognize cancer cells based on the expression of specific proteins located on the cell surface, whereas our TCR technology provides the T cells with a specific T cell receptor to recognize protein fragments derived from either the surface or inside the cell.
We are investing substantially in manufacturing processes that we believe will be commercially scalable for both CARs and TCRs, and have established a Juno owned and operated manufacturing facility in Bothell, Washington. This facility is manufacturing clinical trial material for certain of our clinical trials, and we intend to use it for commercial manufacturing upon our first product approval. We are also investing to expand our manufacturing capacity. We harvest blood cells from a cancer patient, separate the appropriate T cells, activate the cell, insert the gene sequence for the CAR or TCR construct into the cell’s DNA, and grow these modified T cells to the desired dose level. The modified T cells are stored for later infusion into the patient. Once infused, the T cells are designed to multiply, in a process known as cell expansion, when they encounter the targeted proteins and to kill the targeted cancer cells. We are also investing in technologies that we believe have the potential to meaningfully lower our manufacturing costs, decrease the time it takes to make a product candidate, improve patient outcomes, and increase the efficiency of our manufacturing space.
Our scientific founders and their institutions include world leaders in oncology, immunology, and cell therapy, and they actively contribute towards developing our product candidates and technologies. Collectively, these stakeholders share our commitment to bringing our product candidates to market and our vision of revolutionizing medicine through developing a broadly applicable cell-based platform. We have also entered into a number of strategic collaborations with commercial companies that we believe will help us manufacture and commercialize our product candidates around the world or develop additional or improved product candidates, including Celgene, Editas, Fate, and MedImmune.
Product Candidates in B Cell Malignancies
Our product candidates that are furthest advanced in the clinic are designed to treat B cell malignancies, with a particular focus on r/r B cell aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma ("NHL"), r/r CLL, and r/r B cell ALL. Relapse describes when cancer returns after initially responding to prior treatment, and refractory describes cancer that does not sufficiently respond to prior treatment. Our product candidate JCAR017 and an early stage product candidate incorporating a fully human binding domain leverage CAR technology to target CD19, a protein expressed on the surface of almost all B cell leukemias and lymphomas. Our CAR product candidate JCAR018 targets CD22, a different protein commonly expressed on the surface of B cell leukemias and lymphomas. Despite significant advances over the past two decades, lymphoma and leukemia are estimated to account for approximately 46,000 annual deaths in the United States. 

• | NHL Progress and Strategy. JCAR017, in data presented at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December 2017 ("ASH 2017") from an ongoing trial in patients with r/r NHL, achieved a complete response at three months in 13 of 19 patients, or 68%, at dose level 2 ("DL2") in the "core" analysis group as of a data cutoff date of October 9, 2017. For this core analysis group, seven of 14, or 50%, achieved a complete response at six months. The core analysis group consists of patients with DLBCL (not otherwise specified and transformed from follicular lymphoma) who are ECOG Performance Status 0-1. These patients represent a high-risk patient population, with approximately 90% of treated patients having one or more predictors of poor survival, including double or triple hit lymphoma, being chemorefractory to front-line or subsequent therapies, never reaching a complete remission with prior treatments, or never having undergone an autologous transplant. DL2 is 100 million cells. Enrollment of the pivotal cohort is ongoing with the core analysis group at DL2. No severe cytokine release syndrome ("sCRS") was observed and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ("CTCAE") Grade 3 to 4 neurotoxicity was observed in two of 29 patients, or 7%. These 29 patients all received lymphodepletion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide ("flu/cy") followed by JCAR017 at DL2. The trial began as a Phase I trial in 2015 and we have now completed enrollment of the pivotal cohort that we believe can support accelerated U.S. regulatory approval and a 2019 commercial launch. Juno also began a Phase Ib trial to explore the use of JCAR017 in combination with 

-4-

MedImmune's investigational programmed cell death ligand 1 ("PD-L1") immune checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab, and other immunomodulatory drugs. 

• | CLL Progress and Strategy. Encouraged by JCAR014 data presented at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December 2016 ("ASH 2016"), we have begun a Phase I/II trial using JCAR017 for the treatment of r/r CLL. We believe that if the results of the trial are successful, they may support U.S. regulatory approval as early as 2019 or 2020. Based upon our preclinical and clinical experience to date, we believe that JCAR017 has the potential to deliver comparable or better results when compared to JCAR014.


• | ALL Developments and Strategy. We also intend to develop JCAR017 or a next generation product candidate in both pediatric r/r ALL and adult r/r ALL.

At ASH 2017, we reported interim data from a Phase I trial exploring JCAR018, our CD22-directed CAR product candidate, in pediatric and young adult patients with r/r ALL. In this dose escalation trial, we have seen early signs of activity, with 17 out of 22 r/r ALL patients, or 78%, achieving a complete molecular remission ("CRm") at dose level 2 (1x106 cells/kg) as measured by flow cytometry as of a data cutoff date in October 2017, with the longest durable remission being beyond 2 years. This trial continues to enroll patients. Combining a CD19-directed therapy and a CD22-directed therapy may increase the selection pressure on the cancer and significantly reduce the overall risk of relapse, particularly in patients with ALL. As a result, we are currently investigating preclinical constructs to better understand the optimal way to target these two targets in the same product.
In addition, we have two ongoing Phase I trials exploring the potential of combining a CD19-directed CAR T cell with durvalumab in patients with r/r NHL, one with JCAR017 and one with JCAR014. We are also exploring other combination approaches. For example, in 2017, we began Phase I testing of JCAR014 in patients with r/r CLL in combination with with ibrutinib, which is a small molecule Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently approved for use in the treatment of r/r CLL, and we plan to explore JCAR017 in combination with several different drugs in 2018 and 2019. 
Our goal is to bring best-in-class therapies to market across a range of B cell malignancies, focusing on improving efficacy, safety, and patient experience.
Product Candidates in Multiple Myeloma
Another key area of focus for us is the treatment of multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic malignancy, making up approximately 2% of all cancers. Despite many recent therapeutic advances in the treatment of this disease, multiple myeloma is still largely fatal and an area of high unmet medical need, with greater than 12,500 deaths estimated to have occurred in 2016.
Targeting B-cell maturation antigen ("BCMA") is an area with significant promise in the treatment of multiple myeloma, and we have begun a Phase I clinical trial with JCARH125 in r/r multiple myeloma. JCARH125 is a CAR T cell product candidate that incorporates several important elements that we believe are important for maximizing patient benefit, including a next-generation manufacturing process, a fully-human binding domain, and a 4-1BB costimulatory domain. We expect early results from this study as we move through 2018. If the results are compelling, we intend to move JCARH125 into a registration study. 
We also have two other CAR T cell product candidates, MCARH171 and FCARH143, that target BCMA being studied in Phase I clinical trials, one at each of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center ("MSK") and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (“FHCRC”), respectively. These trials use manufacturing processes from these academic partners. We intend to use these trials to better understand safety and obtain other translational insights to help us to accelerate our JCARH125 program and our multiple myeloma program more generally. 
We have also licensed rights to binding domains against two multiple myeloma targets other than BCMA that we may also advance to the clinic. In addition, in late 2017, we announced three license agreements to advance our program in multiple myeloma using gamma secretase inhibitors ("GSIs") in combination with BCMA-directed CAR T cells. Gamma secretase is an enzyme that cleaves a set of transmembrane proteins, including BCMA. Multiple publications have shown that treatment with GSIs can increase surface expression of BCMA on tumors, particularly multiple myeloma. Increased cell surface BCMA may increase potency of a BCMA-directed CAR T therapy. In 2018, we plan to begin clinical trials combining a GSI with one of our BCMA CAR T cell product candidates.
Additional Product Candidates 
We are conducting Phase I trials for four additional product candidates using our CAR technology, directed against L1CAM, Lewis Y, MUC-16, and ROR-1. We are also conducting two Phase I/II clinical trials for a fifth product candidate, using our 
-5-

TCR technology, directed against WT-1. L1CAM, Lewis Y, MUC-16, ROR-1, and WT-1 are proteins that are overexpressed or aberrantly expressed on certain cancer cells. These trials explore the use of our engineered T cell technologies in cancer patients beyond the blood cancer setting, including patients with common solid tumors. Our MUC-16 directed product candidate is an "armored" CAR that secretes the cytokine interleukin 12 ("IL-12"), a stimulatory signal which we believe may help overcome the inhibitory effects that the tumor microenvironment can have on T cell activity. We expect to have preliminary data from some of these product candidates over the next six to 18 months. We are also planning a trial in 2018, subject to completion of certain preclinical studies, using a CAR product candidate targeting a cytokine receptor, interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2 ("IL13rα2"), for the treatment of glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer.
Another active area of research for Juno is the possibility of treating cancers that are caused by viruses, such as the human papillomavirus ("HPV"), a cause of certain cervical cancers and head and neck malignancies. We are planning preclinical studies to begin in 2018 to enable us to file an Investigational New Drug application ("IND") with the U.S. Food & Drug Administration ("FDA") for a TCR product candidate targeting the HPV e6/e7 oncoproteins, which are proteins that are expressed in many HPV-associated cancers.
The following tables summarize our product candidate pipeline and our active and planned clinical trials: 
Research Strategy
We believe there are a number of areas for ongoing research that may significantly impact our long-term success with CARs and TCRs, including:

• | Cell Selection and Composition. We believe that a defined cell composition has the potential to improve the consistency, potency, cell persistence, and tolerability of CAR and TCR based treatments. Achieving greater product composition consistency through defined cell composition may also facilitate regulatory approval. We are exploring defined cell composition with several of our product candidates, including JCAR017, which includes a defined ratio of T cells known as CD8+ and CD4+ T cells and uses a manufacturing process designed to influence the T cells toward a consistent phenotype and metabolic state. We are continuing to focus on improving our understanding of the different types of T cells in an effort to identify the subsets of T cells that optimize efficacy and safety. We intend to leverage our experience with these product candidates as we advance our pipeline. Our acquisition of Stage Cell Therapeutics GmbH ("Stage") in 2015 gives us access to potential best-in-class cell selection technologies.


• | Cell Persistence. We believe the persistence of our engineered T cells, meaning the duration of time CARs or TCRs have anti-tumor activity in the body, has a meaningful impact on clinical outcomes. We are continuing to invest in technologies to optimize the cell persistence of our genetically-engineered T cells, including technologies related to the manufacturing process, cell composition, cell signaling, single chain variable fragments ("scFvs") that are non-

-6-

immunogenic and fully human, and modulation of a patient’s immune system. We are building internal capabilities through hiring, acquisitions such as X-Body and AbVitro, and collaborations with companies such as Editas and Fate. 

• | Target Protein Selection. We are using bioinformatics, in vitro analyses, animal data, and clinical experience to identify additional target tumor proteins. Our CAR and TCR technologies enable us to explore target proteins located inside cells ("intracellular proteins") and proteins located on the cell surface ("extracellular proteins"), giving us the potential to treat a wide array of cancers. We are also investing in technologies that have the potential to accelerate our generation of TCRs and CARs to new targets. For instance, our acquisition of AbVitro in early 2016 gave us access to a leading next-generation single cell sequencing platform that allows for the identification of full-length, natively paired antibodies and T cell receptors across millions of single cells simultaneously from patient tumor or blood samples.


• | Cell Signaling. Researchers have used CAR T cells for more than two decades in the treatment of cancer. A key insight over the past decade was the addition of a costimulatory domain to the genetically engineered CAR construct. The costimulatory domain amplifies intracellular signaling after the binding domain interacts with a target protein, magnifying the activation of the T cell. We are advancing two next-generation CAR technologies, which we refer to as bispecific CARs and "armored" CARs. Bispecific CARs incorporate a second binding domain on the CAR T cell designed to either amplify or inhibit signaling, a feature that may increase the CAR T cells’ ability to distinguish between cancer cells and normal cells. "Armored" CARs deliver cytokines or other stimulatory signals to modify the tumor microenvironment as well as the CAR T cell. We believe these technologies may be important for the treatment of solid tumors.


• | Combinations. In an attempt to evade the cytotoxic, or cell killing, effects of the immune system, many cancers develop an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which may negatively impact the potency or viability of our engineered T cells in patients. We are exploring various strategies that can positively impact the interaction of our engineered T cells and the tumor microenvironment, with goal of improving the efficacy and tolerability of our product candidates. For instance, certain combinations may help our engineered T cells that persist in a patient's body to remain active over time to increase the durability of the clinical response. We are exploring both approved therapies and drugs that are in development. An example of the output of this research is our ongoing trial combining durvalumab and JCAR017.

Our Strategy
Our current focus is to create best-in-class cancer therapies using human T cells. We believe that genetically-engineered T cells have the potential to meaningfully improve survival and quality of life for cancer patients. Key elements of our strategy include:
Expedite clinical development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of our CD19 product candidates. We began a trial in adult r/r NHL in 2015 with JCAR017, which was initially a Phase I trial, and we have now completed enrollment of the pivotal cohort that we believe can support registration. We recently began a Phase I/II trial with JCAR017 in r/r CLL. We believe data from these trials, if positive, may lead to U.S. regulatory approval for the treatment of adult r/r DLBCL to support a commercial launch in 2019 and U.S. regulatory approval in r/r CLL as early as 2019 or 2020. If approved in r/r NHL, we plan to commercialize this CD19 product candidate in the U.S. using our own commercial organization, to consist of marketing, commercial analytics, and payer/access capabilities and a specialty sales force. We also plan to leverage these commercial capabilities across other indications, such as CLL, ALL, and multiple myeloma, if approved. We expect that data from our U.S. registration trials for our CD19 product candidates will also serve as part of our European Union ("EU") regulatory package. In 2016, Celgene opted in to our CD19 program and therefore is responsible for leading clinical and commercial development of our CD19 product candidates outside of North America and China. Celgene intends to treat patients in the EU in 2018, with a first regulatory approval potentially as early as 2019. In certain types of r/r NHL, we have obtained breakthrough therapy designation for JCAR017 in the United States and access to the PRIority MEdicines ("PRIME") scheme for JCAR017 in the EU, regulatory designations aimed at streamlining the development of promising new therapies. 
Develop process development and manufacturing capabilities to be a competitive advantage. We are investing significant resources to optimize process development and manufacturing. We believe these efforts will lead to better product characterization, a more efficient production cycle, and greater flexibility in implementing manufacturing enhancements. In turn, these improvements may lead to a lower cost of manufacturing, streamlined regulatory reviews, greater convenience for patients and physicians, and better patient outcomes. Additionally, this investment in characterizing and controlling our process has the potential to allow us to better exploit future biologic insights into what cell types improve patient outcomes. We have used contract manufacturing organizations ("CMOs") to provide speed, flexibility and limit upfront capital investment, and successfully brought a CMO on-line to manufacture a product candidate. We have also established a Juno owned and operated 
-7-

manufacturing facility in Bothell, Washington, which manufactures JCAR017 for the ongoing registration trial of JCAR017 in r/r NHL. We expect this manufacturing facility to continue to supply our Juno-sponsored clinical trials, including JCARH125, and commercial launch of JCAR017. We are investing to expand our commercial manufacturing capacity and may also use CMOs for product candidate manufacture again in the future. In addition, in 2015 we acquired Stage, a company with potential best-in-class cell selection and cell activation technologies as well as automation technologies. We are working to integrate these technologies into our manufacturing platform. Our overall goal in process development and manufacturing is to maximize patient benefit and carefully manage our cost structure. 
Invest in our platform to maximize the beneficial outcomes for cancer patients. Because our CAR and TCR technologies are designed to target both proteins on the cell surface and inside the cell, we believe we have the potential to treat a wide array of cancers, including solid tumors. We believe there are multiple ways to continue to improve efficacy and tolerability of each of these technologies. We are conducting Phase I trials for additional product candidates targeting seven different cancer-associated proteins beyond CD19. We began Phase I testing of our first CD19-directed "armored" CAR in B cell malignancies in 2017. As data emerge from these studies, we may advance one or more of these product candidates beyond proof of concept trials. We, together with our collaborators, intend to advance multiple additional product candidates into clinical testing over the next five years, with an increasing focus on addressing solid tumors, which cause the vast majority of cancer-related deaths in the developed world. Additionally, we believe that there may be multiple opportunities to improve the efficacy or safety of our product candidates by manipulating the genome, RNA, cell signaling pathways within a cell, or cell surface proteins. To that end, we have made substantial internal investments in these capabilities and entered into collaborations with companies such as Editas, Fate, and Celgene. We expect to continue to build our internal capabilities and to look to access best-in-class technologies outside the company with the goal of making better products for patients.
Leverage our relationships with our founding institutions, scientific founders and other scientific advisors. Our world-renowned scientific founders and founding institutions, have a history of seminal discoveries and significant experience in oncology, immunology, and cell therapy. We intend to be a science-driven company in all our strategic decision-making and to continue to use our scientific founders’ insights, discoveries, and know-how as we develop our pipeline and technologies. 
Background on the Immune System and T Cells
The immune system recognizes danger signals and responds to threats at a cellular level. It is often described as having two arms. The first arm is known as the innate immune system, which recognizes non-specific signals of infection or abnormalities as a first line of defense. The innate immune system is the initial response to an infection, and the response is the same every time regardless of prior exposure to the infectious agent. The second arm is known as the adaptive immune system, which is composed of highly specific, targeted cells and provides long-term recognition and protection from infectious agents and abnormal processes such as cancer. The adaptive immune response is further subdivided into humoral, or antibody-based, and cellular, which includes T cell-based immune responses.
The most significant components of the cellular aspect of the adaptive immune response are T cells, so called because they generally mature in the thymus. T cells are involved in both sensing and killing infected or abnormal cells, as well as coordinating the activation of other cells in an immune response. These cells can be classified into two major subsets, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, based on cell surface expression of CD4 or CD8 glycoprotein. Both subsets of T cells have specific functions in mounting an immune response capable of clearing an infection or eliminating cancerous cells. CD4+ T cells, or helper T cells, are generally involved in coordinating the immune response by enhancing the activation, expansion, migration, and effector functions of other types of immune cells. CD8+ T cells, or cytotoxic T cells, can directly attack and kill cells they recognize as infected or otherwise abnormal, and are aided by CD4+ T cells. Both types of T cells are activated when their T cell receptor recognizes and binds to a specific protein structure expressed on the surface of another cell. This protein structure is composed of the major histocompatibility complex ("MHC") and a small protein fragment, or peptide, derived from either proteins inside the cell or on the cell surface. Circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells survey the body differentiating between MHC/peptide structures containing "foreign" peptides and those containing "self" peptides. A foreign peptide may signal the presence of an immune threat, such as an infection or cancer, causing the T cell to activate, recruit other immune cells, and eliminate the targeted cell.
Although the immune system is designed to identify foreign or abnormal proteins expressed on tumor cells, this process is often defective in cancer patients. The defective process sometimes occurs when the cancer cells closely resemble healthy cells and go unnoticed or if tumors lose their protein expression. Additionally, cancer cells employ a number of mechanisms to escape immune detection to suppress the effect of the immune response. Some tumors also encourage the production of regulatory T cells that block cytotoxic T cells that would normally attack the cancer.

Our CAR and TCR Technologies
Our CAR and TCR technologies alter T cells ex vivo, or outside the body, so that the T cells can recognize specific proteins on the surface or inside cancer cells or other diseased cells in order to kill those diseased cells. As depicted below, with both our CAR and TCR technologies, we (1) harvest a patient’s white blood cells in a process called leukapheresis, and while ex vivo we (2) select and activate certain T cells of interest. (3) Gene sequences for the CAR or TCR construct are transferred into the T cell DNA using a viral vector, such as a lentivirus or a gamma retrovirus. The number of cells is (4) expanded until it reaches the desired dose. These genetically engineered cells are (5) infused back into the patient. 

When the engineered T cell engages the target protein on the cancer cell, it triggers further multiplication of the cells in the body and activation of a cytotoxic, or cell-killing, response against the cancer cell. These T cells have an "auto-regulatory" capability that stimulates their multiplication in the presence of the target protein and a reduction in the number of such cells as the target protein declines.
In most of our trials, including our trials with JCAR017 and JCARH125, after a patient goes through leukapheresis, the patient is administered chemotherapeutic agents before infusion of the engineered T cells in order to provide an environment for the engineered T cells to thrive. We refer to this process as conditioning chemotherapy or lymphodepletion. It is an active area of research to determine the optimal lymphodepletion regimen to use in conjunction with engineered T cell therapy, in terms of dose, duration, and type or combinations of chemotherapeutic agents, such as cyclophosphamide or fludarabine.
The genetically-engineered CARs and TCRs are designed to help a patient’s immune system overcome survival mechanisms employed by cancer cells. CAR technology directs T cells to recognize cancer cells based on expression of specific cell surface proteins, whereas high-affinity TCR technology provides the T cells with a specific T cell receptor that recognizes protein fragments derived from either intracellular or extracellular proteins. The differences in these two technologies may enable us to develop immunotherapies targeting a broad array of cancer-associated proteins, including those expressed by solid organ cancers.
For both the CAR and TCR technologies, we believe that the T cell subsets used in treatment may have a significant impact on cell persistence, efficacy, and/or tolerability. We are investing significant resources in understanding the optimal cells and cell conditions for treatment. Animal data have shown that using a defined composition of CD8+ cells and CD4+ cells can improve the frequency, robustness, and duration of an anti-tumor response. Animal data have also shown that certain CD8+ T cells, when introduced, are more likely to persist as part of the T cell memory pool with the capability of self-renewal, which may lead to a longer duration of the therapeutic effect in patients. 
We believe our focus on optimizing certain cell characteristics and cellular conditions increases our probability of generating best-in-class therapeutics. Moreover, we believe that the enhanced product characterization that results from a defined cell population may provide greater consistency across patients and give us an improved process development and a potential advantage with clinicians, patients, and regulators.
Differences between CARs and TCRs
There are three main differences between CARs and TCRs:

• | Site of Protein Recognition. CARs recognize proteins expressed on the cell’s surface, whereas TCRs recognize peptide fragments from proteins expressed either inside the cell or on the cell’s surface. TCRs are capable of targeting a broader range of proteins and may be able to more selectively target cancer cells or target a broader array of tumor types.

-9-


• | MHC Restriction. TCRs recognize proteins that are presented to the immune system as a peptide bound to an MHC, and are therefore restricted to a certain MHC type. MHC types vary across the human population. It is estimated that approximately 80% of the U.S. population has one of the four most common MHC types. Due to this variability, multiple different TCR product candidates will be needed to address any given target protein for a broad population. In contrast, CARs are capable of recognizing the target protein regardless of MHC type. Additionally, most of the TCR product candidates developed in the field to date have been designed to recognize peptides in the context of Class I MHC, which activates CD8+ cells and not CD4+ cells. The implications of the preferential CD8+ activation are not clear, but given the importance of CD8+ and CD4+ cells in a typical immune response, activation of a CD4+ cellular response is likely important in generating maximum efficacy. During 2017, our research team made significant progress in supporting activation and persistence of both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells using the same eTCR construct.


• | Maturity of the Technology. The life sciences industry has been developing antibodies for several decades and we believe scientific advances made with this technology can be leveraged to rapidly and predictably generate scFvs to incorporate into a CAR construct and enable it to target a specific protein. Industrial production of TCRs is relatively new, and we are investing in improving our understanding of important variables such as the optimal binding efficiency and structure.

CARs
There are several key components to our CAR technology, each of which may have a significant impact on its utility in cancer immunotherapy:

• | Targeting Element. Our CAR construct typically uses an scFv, also referred to as a binding domain, to recognize a protein of interest. The scFv is derived from the portion of an antibody that specifically recognizes a target protein, and when it is expressed on the surface of a CAR T cell and subsequently binds to a target protein on a cancer cell, it is able to maintain the CAR T cell in proximity to the cancer cell and trigger the activation of the T cell. For example, our most clinically-advanced CAR T cell programs use an scFv from a mouse-derived antibody to target a cell surface protein called CD19. Through our 2015 acquisition of X-Body, we have access to a library of fully human scFvs and our AbVitro acquisition enables us to identify naturally occurring antibodies. We plan to use both of these technologies in the development of future product candidates.


• | Spacer and Transmembrane Domain. The spacer connects the extracellular scFv targeting element to the transmembrane domain, which transverses the cell membrane and connects to the intracellular signaling domain. Data from our scientific founders suggest that the spacer may need to be varied to optimize the potency of the CAR T cell toward the cancer cell due to factors such as the size of the target protein, the region of the target protein where the scFv binds, and the size and affinity of the scFv. Through our collaborations, we have access to a library of spacer constructs.


• | Costimulatory Domains. Upon recognition and binding of the scFv of the CAR T cell to the cancer cell, there is a conformational change that leads to an activation signal to the CAR T cell through CD3-zeta, an intracellular signaling protein. Our current CAR constructs also include either a 4-1BB or CD28 costimulatory signaling domain to mimic a "second signal" that amplifies the activation of the CAR T cells, leading to a more robust signal to the T cell to multiply and kill the cancer cell. While head-to-head clinical comparisons have not been conducted, in some disease settings there is some preclinical and early clinical evidence that suggests that 4-1BB has some advantages over CD28 as a costimulatory domain, including increased persistence and a metabolic profile supporting gradual expansion, as opposed to rapid expansion. Our early clinical data with CD19-directed CAR T cells support this view. We incorporate the 4-1BB costimulatory domain in JCAR017, JCARH125, JCAR014, JCAR018, JCAR023, JCAR024, and our CD19 product candidate with a fully human binding domain. Additionally, we are exploring the use of a "third signal" in improving the efficacy of our CAR T technology. In 2017, we began human testing of an "armored CAR" that includes both a CD28 co-stimulatory domain and another signal through 4-1BB ligand.

Next-Generation CAR Technology
We are investing significant resources and are developing deep expertise on how each element of the CAR construct affects the potency and durability of the T cell response that ensues, as we believe these will be the key determinants for the long-term ability to create novel CAR T cell products with improved patient benefit.
As we build on the specificity of our technologies and our understanding of mechanisms of immune evasion used by cancer cells, we are advancing two next-generation CAR technologies, "armored" CARs and bispecific CARs, that incorporate mechanisms to either dampen or amplify T cell activation signals present on the cancer cells or in the tumor microenvironment. Our "armored" CAR technology can incorporate the production or expression of locally acting signaling proteins to amplify the immune response within the tumor microenvironment with the goal of minimizing systemic side effects. An example of such a signaling protein is IL-12, which can stimulate T cell activation and recruitment. We believe "armored" CAR technology will be especially useful in solid tumor indications, in which microenvironment and potent immunosuppressive mechanisms have the potential to make the establishment of a robust anti-tumor response more challenging.
Our bispecific CAR technology includes a second binding domain on the CAR T cell designed to either amplify or inhibit signaling, a feature that may increase our CAR T cells’ ability to distinguish between cancer cells and normal cells. For example, a CAR T cell can be engineered such that it would be triggered in the presence of one target protein, but if a second protein is present it would be inhibited. Alternatively, it could also be engineered such that two target proteins would be required for maximal activation. These approaches may increase the specificity of the CAR for tumor relative to normal tissue.
We are also exploring a number of technologies that modulate T cell biology and their biologic properties in patients. For example, we have partnered with Editas, a leader in applying genome editing such as CRISPR/Cas9 and Talon technologies to create human therapeutics, and Fate, a leader in using pharmacologic modulators such as small molecules to alter the properties of cells while they are ex vivo. With Editas, we are exploring the biologic implication on our engineered T cell technologies of knocking-out or altering the function of a number of human genes. With Fate, we are exploring the potential for these modulators to alter intracellular signaling pathways, with the potential to alter the subtype of T cell or the state of the T cell. The goal of these modifications is to improve efficacy and safety of our products.
TCRs
Much like our CAR technology, our high-affinity TCR technology is designed to activate a potent immune response against cancer through the introduction of engineered T cells. The gene sequence we introduce with our TCR technology is designed to enable the engineered cell to assemble a TCR that recognizes a specific MHC/peptide structure. Modified T cells expressing a TCR construct have the potential advantage of recognizing peptides from cancer-associated proteins expressed either on the surface of or inside the tumor cell, which may allow us to target a broad range of tumors. Beyond the fact that TCRs can recognize peptides derived from intracellular proteins, another advantage of TCRs is that they are fully human and therefore may be less likely to elicit an immune response against the infused TCR cells.
The engagement of a TCR is restricted to a certain MHC type. Due to the variability of MHC types across the human population, different TCRs will be required for various segments of the population. Our TCR constructs are selected by 
-11-

screening healthy donors for naturally-occurring high-affinity TCRs against a MHC/ peptide combination of interest. Depending on the binding affinity of the selected TCR construct, it is either used directly or modified by mutating a specific region, the hypervariable domain, of the TCR binding pocket to create a higher affinity construct. Based on the limited number of patients who have received any TCR treatment to date, these TCR cells appear to behave like endogenous T cells after re-infusion back into the patient. They undergo a process similar to an endogenous T cell of cell expansion and cytotoxic activation upon recognition of their defined cancer-associated proteins.

Important areas of investment for us going forward will be industrializing the creation and manufacturing of TCRs, improving screening processes to better ensure that TCR constructs do not cross-react with normally expressed or other proteins, and finding costimulatory signals to enhance the potency of the genetically engineered cells.
Our primary method of identifying novel TCRs is utilizing our next-generation, high throughput, single cell sequencing technology, which allows us to interrogate millions of cells per experiment. An important application for this technology is to find high affinity, naturally occurring, matched chain TCRs from the normal human immune repertoire, which we believe have a lower risk of unexpected off-target binding than TCRs that have manipulated or mutagenized during development. This technology significantly improves the speed at which we find these TCRs, allowing us to optimize binding affinity and develop TCRs for a larger percentage of the population.
Product Pipeline
Product Candidates in B Cell Malignancies
Our product candidates that are the furthest advanced in the clinic are designed to treat B cell malignancies, with a particular focus on r/r NHL, r/r CLL, and r/r ALL.
B Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas
NHL is the most common cancer of the lymphatic system. NHL is not a single disease, but rather a group of several closely related cancers. Although the various types of NHL have some things in common, they differ in their appearance under the microscope, their molecular features, their growth patterns, their impact on the body, and treatment. Over 72,000 cases of NHL are diagnosed annually in the United States, and 85% derive from B cell lineages, which express CD19. B cell NHLs are a large group of cancers that are typically divided into aggressive (fast-growing) and indolent (slow-growing) types.
Aggressive NHL also represents a collection of lymphoma subtypes. The most common histologic type of aggressive lymphoma is DLBCL, which is also the most common subtype of all NHLs, and represents approximately 40% of new cases annually. Unlike indolent lymphomas, which have a median survival time as long as 20 years, DLBCL, if left untreated, may have survival measured in weeks or months. Patients often present with a rapidly enlarging mass in a lymphatic region. Extranodal involvement or associated constitutional symptoms are uncommon, although the presence of these symptoms indicates a more aggressive phenotype. The typical approach to treatment of r/r DLBCL involves induction chemotherapy to get a patient into remission, followed by an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant ("HSCT"). Autologous HSCT is a treatment that involves the collection of a patient's own hematopoietic stem cells once the patient is in remission, followed by further chemotherapy and/or radiation to deplete the patient's immune system and existing hematopoietic stem cells, then the infusion of the previously collected hematopoietic stem cells back into the patient. However, not all r/r DLBCL patients are able to undergo autologous HSCT due to failure to respond adequately to the induction chemotherapy, risk of complication, or 
-12-

other reasons. We estimate that only approximately 17% of first salvage patients, or patients who relapsed or were refractory after one round of prior treatment, undergo autologous HSCT. For patients who are unable or otherwise do not receive autologous HSCT, the prognosis is grim. In a study conducted by GSK, HOVON (Hemato-Oncologie voor Volwassenen Nederland), and other groups, in patients with r/r DLBCL who relapsed or were refractory after one round of prior treatment, patients that did not undergo autologous HSCT in the second-line setting and were treated solely with chemotherapy had a two year overall survival rate of 22–27%, compared to a two year overall survival rate of 68–76% for patients that underwent autologous HSCT. In a separate study conducted by the Lymphoma Academic Research Organization in patients with r/r DLBCL who relapsed or were refractory after two rounds of prior treatment and who had not received prior HSCT, the patients that were unable to or otherwise did not then undergo HSCT in the third-line setting and were treated solely with chemotherapy had a median overall survival of 3.3 months and a one year overall survival rate of 16%, as compared to a median overall survival of 11.5 months and a one year overall survival rate of 43% for those who then underwent autologous HSCT. 
The indolent lymphomas represent a wide group of tumors that often have a long natural history characterized by frequent relapses; together, the indolent lymphomas account for approximately 36% of NHL incidence in the United States. Although these malignancies are treated routinely with a combination of chemotherapy and antibodies, there is no standard of care for relapsed indolent NHL. The typical treatment approaches include multiple rounds of induction chemotherapy or more aggressive salvage therapies, including autologous HSCT. Unfortunately, these treatments are generally not curative. Patients with recurrent or progressive indolent lymphoma may be candidates for allogeneic HSCT, involving the infusion of a matched donor's hematopoietic stem cells instead of the patient's own cells, which can provide long-term disease free survival to some.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
CLL is the most common type of leukemia, and it occurs most frequently in older individuals, with diagnoses in persons under 30 years of age occurring only rarely. Each year, approximately 20,000 patients are diagnosed with CLL in the United States. Nearly all CLL develops from B cells that express CD19. Approximately 75–80% of individuals with CLL have standard risk disease at diagnosis, and for them the level of disease burden determines both prognosis and the need for immediate treatment or "watchful waiting" before the initiation of any therapy. Over time, CLL develops poor risk features, including expression of CD38, ZAP70, unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain sequences, or cytogenetic abnormalities or gene mutations. Approximately 20–25% of CLL patients can initially present with poor risk disease. Median progression-free survival in these high risk groups is often under 12 to 18 months after frontline therapy, and less than 12 months in relapsed/refractory disease.
The goal of therapy in CLL for individuals with both treatment naïve and relapsed/refractory disease is a clinical complete response. Strong correlations have been demonstrated between depth of response, specifically to levels in the bone marrow below detectable MRD by flow cytometry, and survival. An array of therapies have been evaluated and approved for use in treatment naive and relapsed/refractory CLL, including combination chemotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, ibrutinib, idelalisib, alemtuzumab, and ofatumumab, and several others continue in development. However, the long-term benefit for these agents has generally been tempered by the low likelihood of complete responses, challenging toxicities, and limited duration of disease responses. For instance, patients treated with ibrutinib whose disease progresses early after treatment have poor clinical outcomes with a median survival of approximately three months. Individuals with CLL are generally not considered candidates for allogeneic or autologous HSCT due in part to the median age of 71 years at diagnosis. Therefore, significant opportunity exists for novel therapies to address this unmet need with agents that are tolerated in this patient population.
B Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
ALL is an uncontrolled proliferation of lymphoblasts, which are immature white blood cells. The lymphoblasts, which are produced in the bone marrow, cause damage and death by inhibiting the production of normal cells. Approximately 6,000 patients are diagnosed with ALL in the United States each year, and although just under half of the new diagnoses are in adult patients, the vast majority of the approximately 1,400 deaths per year occur in adults. There are two main types of ALL, B cell ALL and T cell ALL. Approximately 80% of cases of ALL are B cell ALL, which we aim to address with our CD19 product candidates.
Treatment outcomes for ALL patients can be distinguished between CR and CRm rates. CR occurs when there is no clinical evidence of the disease based on less than 5% blast cells in the marrow, blood cell counts within normal limits, and no signs or symptoms of the disease. CRm occurs when a patient has all of the above outcomes and there is no evidence of ALL cells in the marrow when using sensitive tests such as polymerase chain reaction ("PCR") and/or flow cytometry. CR rates are the typical regulatory standard, but recent evidence suggests that achieving a CRm is a better predictor of long-term survival.
Until 2017, the standard-of-care treatment for both adults and children involved multi-drug chemotherapeutic regimens, and in some cases HSCT. Frontline chemotherapy in adults with ALL still delivers complete remission in approximately 80% of patients with their initial course. However, approximately 60% of these patients who achieve a complete remission with their initial course of chemotherapy will relapse. Most patients that relapse after the first course of chemotherapy will die in under a 
-13-

year, and patients that have failed at least two salvage therapies have a median survival that is typically around three months. Allogeneic HSCT offers the potential for disease eradication in some individuals, however, the option is available only to approximately a third of patients due to the lack of compatible stem cell source, general health, or the high risk of complications. Even in patients who undergo allogeneic HSCT, approximately 20-30% of patients die of treatment-related complications and the median disease-free survival is less than six months.
In 2017, two antibody-based products, Amgen's blinatumomab (Blincyto) and Pfizer's inotuzumab-ozogamicin (Besponsa), obtained FDA approval for the treatment of r/r ALL. In clinical trial data, both of these products showed improved response rates and median overall survival as compared to chemotherapy. However, similar to chemotherapy, these products showed deterioration of response and duration of response with successive lines of salvage treatment. Median overall survival was under 12 months in all salvage settings and overall survival in the second salvage setting was approximately 5 months for blinatumomab and approximately 6 months for inotuzumab-ozogamicin.
Thus, despite the introduction of these novel treatment options, adult r/r ALL remains a significant unmet medical need. In particular, in second salvage and beyond, the currently available therapies for adult r/r ALL provide poor long-term outcomes and are associated with severe and life-threatening toxicities that may limit their use in certain populations or require early discontinuation of therapy.
CD19 Overview
Our lead candidate, JCAR017 uses CAR T cell technology to target CD19. Other of our CD19-directed product candidates include JCAR014 and a product candidate with a fully human binding domain that entered Phase I testing in 2017. These product candidates differ in several respects as described below. We believe our access to and clinical experience with multiple CD19 CARs in patients with B cell malignancies gives us the opportunity to bring best-in-class therapies to market across a range of different blood cancers. We have treated nearly 600 patients with anti-CD19 CAR T cells.
We believe CD19 presents an attractive immunotherapeutic target for our technology for a number of reasons:

• | CD19 is expressed by most B cell malignancies including NHL, ALL, and CLL. Within these CD19 positive malignancies, it is generally expressed on all of a patient’s cancer cells.


• | CD19 is expressed on all stages of B lineage cells, and it is present in the vast majority of precursor B cell ALL cases.


• | CD19 is not known to be expressed on any healthy tissue other than B cells. Although treatment with a CD19-directed therapy has the potential to deplete B cells, experience with Rituxan has shown that humans can live with B cell depletion for a prolonged period. Further, CD19 is not expressed on hematopoietic stem cells, and therefore B cells should return when the CAR T cell is no longer present.

JCAR017
Overview. JCAR017 is the backbone of our CD19 program. It uses the 4-1BB costimulatory domain, a murine scFv binding domain, a defined cell composition made up of a 1:1 ratio of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, and a manufacturing process designed to influence the phenotypic and metabolic state of the T cells toward more naive and quiescent cells, which we believe improves patient outcomes. The defined cell composition is attained by using separate CD4+ and CD8+ selection and processing and then controlling for the number of each cell subtype in the final product. The process provides a consistent dose of CD4+ and CD8+ cells and decreases the variability of other phenotypic and metabolic conditions of the T cell. JCAR017 was originally developed at Seattle Children’s Research Institute ("SCRI"). 
JCAR017 is currently in development for adults with r/r aggressive NHL. We began a trial in r/r aggressive NHL began in 2015 to explore this product candidate’s efficacy in this setting and to explore multiple-dose schedules. Although it began as a Phase I trial, we have now completed enrollment in the trial of the pivotal cohort that we believe can support accelerated U.S. regulatory approval in r/r DLBCL. We have also begun a Phase I/II trial using JCAR017 for the treatment of r/r CLL. We believe that if the results of this trial are successful, they may support U.S. regulatory approval in r/r CLL as early as 2019 or 2020. We expect to initiate clinical trials with JCAR017, or a similar drug product designed specifically for the target patient population, in other B cell malignancies over the next 12 to 24 months.
The FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to JCAR017 for the treatment of patients with r/r aggressive large B cell NHL, including DLBCL, not otherwise specified (de novo or transformed from indolent lymphoma), primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma ("PMBCL"), or follicular lymphoma grade 3B. The FDA has also granted orphan drug designation for JCAR017 in DLBCL, CLL, and ALL. In addition, the European Medicines Agency ("EMA") Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ("CHMP") and Committee for Advanced Therapies ("CAT") have granted JCAR017 access to the Priority Medicines ("PRIME") scheme for r/r DLBCL.

Clinical Experience. We began a multicenter trial in 2015 of JCAR017 in adults with r/r aggressive NHL under a Juno-sponsored Investigational New Drug ("IND") application. We refer to this trial as the TRANSCEND trial. Initially the trial was a Phase I dose-escalation trial and the primary endpoints were to evaluate preliminary toxicity, safety, and cell expansion and cell persistence of JCAR017. The secondary endpoints of the trial were to assess efficacy, durability of responses, progression-free survival, and overall survival. All patients on the trial receive lymphodepletion with flu/cy, and there is no prophylactic use of safety medications called for by the protocol. The trial also explored a one dose versus two dose dosing schedule. 
In 2016 and 2017, the protocol for TRANSCEND was amended to include measures of efficacy as primary endpoints of the trial, and we have now completed enrollment of the pivotal cohort that we believe can support U.S. regulatory approval in r/r DLBCL, with the potential for a commercial launch of JCAR017 in 2019. After analyzing results in the ongoing trial and in discussion with FDA, we narrowed the eligibility criteria for the registration portion of the trial. This group of patients is known as the “core” group, while we label all patients in the trial as the “full” group. The core group includes patients with DLBCL (de novo and transformed from follicular lymphoma) that are ECOG Performance Status 0-1. The full analysis group includes all r/r patients in the DLBCL cohort, including 11 patients with poor performance status or niche subtypes of aggressive NHL. When analyzing efficacy, we believe the core group is more representative of the results we expect to see in the analysis of the registration portion of the trial. 
The ECOG performance status is a scale used to measure how a disease affects daily living abilities of a patient. Grade 0 represents that a patient is fully active and able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction. Grade 1 represents that a patient is restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, such as light house work or office work. ECOG Performance Status 2 represents that a patient is ambulatory and capable of self-care, but unable to carry out any work activities, and is up and about more than 50% of waking hours. 
We presented interim data from the TRANSCEND trial at ASH 2017. As of a data cutoff date of October 9, 2017, results for the core group at DL2 were as follows:

Summary of Clinical DataJCAR017 TRANSCEND - r/r DLBCL Core Group 
Dose Level & Dose Schedule | Dose Level 2 (1*108 cells)Single Dose(1)
Best Overall Response Rate: Complete Responses + Partial Responses | 22/27 (81%) 
Overall Response Rate at Three Months | 14/19 (74%) 
Complete Response Ongoing at Three Months | 13/19 (68%) 
Complete Response Ongoing at Six Months | 7/14 (50%) 
sCRS(2) | 0/29 (0%) 
Severe Neurotoxicity(3) | 2/29 (7%) 
(1) Two patients were evaluable for safety but not yet evaluable for efficacy. (2) For this trial, sCRS is defined based on Lee et al. 2014 criteria, according with which sCRS is generally identified by certain side effects, including hypotension, or low blood pressure, requiring treatment with a high dose of a single vasopressor or with multiple vasopressors, or respiratory distress, or breathing difficulties, requiring significant supplemental oxygen and in some cases mechanical ventilation and medical management in the intensive care unit.(3) CTCAE Grade 3 and above neurotoxicity. Characteristic symptoms of neurotoxicity include encephalopathy, headache, seizure, tremor, confusion, and aphasia.

Other treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE), whether or not treatment related, occurring in at least 25% of core patients included neutropenia, fatigue, anemia, CRS of any grade, and thrombocytopenia. For tolerability across doses in full group, the most common TEAE other than CRS and NT that occurred at ≥ 25% included neutropenia (50%), fatigue (38%), anemia (39%), thrombocytopenia (28%), diarrhea (25%), and nausea (26%). The most common TEAEs were similar between core and full groups.
The TRANSCEND trial continues, enrolling more patients at DL2 using a single dose. During 2018, given the results to date, we may explore a third, higher dose as well. 
Encouraged by JCAR014 data in r/r CLL presented in 2016, we have also begun a Phase I/II trial using JCAR017 for the treatment of r/r CLL. We believe that if the results of the planned trial are successful, they may support U.S. regulatory approval in r/r CLL as early as 2019 or 2020.
JCAR014
Overview. JCAR014 also targets CD19. JCAR014, like JCAR017, uses the 4-1BB costimulatory domain and is composed of CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells in a defined ratio. A different manufacturing process from JCAR017 leads to different 
-15-

phenotypic and metabolic profiles for these T cells. At this time, we do not intend to develop JCAR014 commercially, but we do believe that its clinical development provides insights that we can apply across our CD19 portfolio and to our CAR T cell technology more broadly. JCAR014 was originally developed at FHCRC. 
Clinical Experience. JCAR014 is being evaluated at FHCRC in a Phase I/II trial as a treatment for adults with any of several B cell malignancies, including ALL, NHL, and CLL, in patients relapsed or refractory to standard therapies, under a FHCRC IND. The trial was initiated in May 2013. The Phase I/II trial is designed to evaluate three dose levels: 2x105 cells/kg, 2x106 cells/kg, and 2x107 cells/kg. Dose level 3 (2x107 cells/kg) has been discontinued as it exceeded the maximum tolerated dose as defined by the study. The primary endpoint of the trial is to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary safety of using JCAR014 to treat CD19-positive advanced B cell malignancies. The secondary endpoints of the trial include assessing the duration of persistence of the modified T cells, determining whether the modified T cells traffic in the bone marrow and function in vivo, determining if the modified T cells have antitumor activity in patients with measurable tumor burden prior to T cell transfer, and determining if the treatment is associated with tumor lysis syndrome. In 2017, we amended the protocol for this trial to explore the combination of JCAR014 with ibrutinib in r/r CLL patients.
We are also conducting trials with JCAR014 in combination with other agents, including an ongoing Phase Ib trial with the MedImmune checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab in which we are enrolling adult r/r NHL patients and Phase I testing with ibrutinib in r/r CLL patients. We believe that these and other combination trials will provide key insights on the next set of development trials in lymphoma and CLL. These trials may also potentially inform strategies for solid organ tumor settings and next generation CAR constructs.
JCAR015
In early 2017 we determined to cease development of JCAR015 and to redirect associated resources to the development of a defined cell product candidate in the adult r/r ALL setting.
CD22-directed Product Candidate: JCAR018
We also have another product candidate in clinical trials, JCAR018, that also designed for the treatment of B cell malignancies, but uses technology to target a different cell surface protein on B cells, CD22. Like CD19, CD22 is widely expressed on B lymphocytes. It is expressed by most B cell malignancies, including NHL, ALL, and CLL, although its expression is not as common as CD19 in some of these diseases. Within these CD22 positive malignancies, it is generally expressed on all of a patient’s cancer cells. Additionally, treatment with CD19-directed therapies has led to the emergence in some patients of CD19-negative cancer cells. To date, these patients’ cancer cells have retained CD22 expression, potentially making a CD22-directed CAR T cell product candidate an important potential treatment for these patients, alone or in combination with CD19-directed therapy. Similar to CD19, CD22 is not known to be expressed on any healthy tissue other than B cells. It is also not expressed on hematopoietic stem cells, and therefore B cells should return when the CAR T cell is no longer present.
JCAR018 is the CD22-directed CAR product candidate with respect to which we have licensed technology from Opus Bio. JCAR018 has a fully human binding domain and a 4-1BB costimulatory domain. This product candidate was originally developed at the NCI. 
JCAR018 is being tested in a Phase I trial at the NCI in pediatric and young adult patients that have CD22-positive r/r ALL or r/r NHL, under an NCI IND. The trial is open to patients who have either CD19-negative or CD19-positive disease and who have or have not received previous CAR T cell treatment. 
Based on investigator-reported data presented at ASH 2017 as of a data cutoff date in October 2017, in r/r ALL patients who received dose level 2 (1x106 cells/kg) of JCAR018 and flu/cy lymphodepletion, 17 of 22, or 78%, achieved a CRm as measured by flow cytometry, with the longest durable remission beyond two years. The product candidate had generally manageable adverse events in the 31 r/r ALL patients and one r/r NHL patient treated. The primary adverse event was CTCAE Grade 1 to 2 CRS, with no severe or irreversible neurotoxicity. There were two deaths due to sepsis in a patient after resolution of CRS. Other treatment-emergent adverse events, whether or not treatment related, occurring in at least 25% of patients included hypoalbuminemia, anemia, aspartate aminotransferase increased, hypocalcemia, lymphocyte count decreased, neutrophil count decreased, fever, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, platelet count decreased, white blood cell decreased, activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged, alanine aminotransferase increased, febrile neutropenia, hypophosphatemia, alkaline phosphatase increased, hypotension, diarrhea, headache, nausea, pain, sinus tachycardia, anorexia, edema limbs, hypomagnesemia, vomiting, fatigue, abdominal pain, creatinine phosphokinase increased, chills, blood bilirubin increased, hypercalcemia, hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia. All of the treated r/r ALL patients had been previously treated with anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy and had previously undergone at least one allogeneic stem cell transplant.
This trial continues and we plan to present additional data on this trial in 2018. 
-16-

Combining CD19-directed therapy and CD22-directed therapy may increase the selection pressure on the cancer and significantly reduce the overall risk of relapse. We are currently testing preclinical constructs to better understand the optimal way to target both CD22 and CD19 in the same product, with the aim of increasing the rate of durable remissions.
B Cell Malignancies Strategy and Development Plans
With respect to r/r NHL, we initiated our multi-center trial for JCAR017 in adults in 2015 and announced promising interim data from the trial at ASH 2017. Although the trial began as a dose-escalation Phase I trial, we have now completed enrollment in the trial of the pivotal cohort that we believe can support registration, with a goal of enabling a commercial launch of JCAR017 in r/r DLBCL in 2019. 
With respect to r/r CLL, we began a Phase I/II trial using JCAR017 for the treatment of r/r CLL. We believe that if the results of the trial are successful, they may support U.S. regulatory approval in r/r CLL as early as 2019 or 2020.
With respect to pediatric and adult r/r ALL, we intend to outline the specifics of our strategy later in 2018.
Not every patient achieves a complete remission or CR, and of those that do, many patients have seen their cancer relapse. Several key hypotheses have emerged for improving patient long-term outcomes. In particular, we believe that improving the predictability of early cell expansion, improving CAR T cell persistence, overcoming the immunosuppressive effects of the tumor microenvironment, and addressing cancer cells losing expression of the epitope to which the CAR T binds are important areas to explore for potential clinical benefit. We expect several generations of product improvements for CD19 over the coming years, as we work to optimize patient outcomes for patients with lymphoma or leukemia.
Improved Predictability of Cell Expansion
We began a Phase I trial through our collaborator MSK of a CD19/4-1BBL "armored" CAR in 2017. "Armored" CAR product candidates are designed to explore the potential for synergistic effects of a CAR T cell and the production or expression of locally acting signaling proteins by the CAR T cell, such as 4-1BBL. In preclinical models, these "armored" CARs have greater cell expansion than our other CAR T product candidates. We may in the future study additional "armored" CARs directed to CD19 beyond the CD19/4-1BBL "armored" CAR that is currently being studied at MSK.
Improving CAR T Cell Persistence
We began a Phase I clinical trial in 2017 at FHCRC of our CD19-directed CAR product candidate with a fully human binding domain, in advanced B cell malignancies, including r/r NHL. We believe that the use of a human binding domain may lead to decreased risk of an immune response by a patient’s own immune system against the CAR T cell and increased persistence of the CAR T cells in the body. Our clinical experience to date suggests that increased CAR T cell persistence can potentially increase the duration of clinical response. 
Overcoming the Tumor Microenvironment
We initiated a multi-center, global trial, referred to as the PLATFORM trial, in collaboration with Celgene in 2017 to explore JCAR017 in combination with durvalumab in patients with r/r NHL. We expect to open additional arms of this trial in 2018 and 2019 to explore combinations of JCAR017 with other immunomodulatory agents. We are also conducting Phase Ib trials, under FHCRC INDs, using JCAR014 in combination with durvalumab in patients with r/r NHL and in combination with ibrutinib in patients with r/r CLL. We believe that these and other combination trials will provide key insights on the next set of development trials in leukemia, lymphoma, and solid tumor settings, and also potentially inform next generation CAR constructs. 
Overcoming CD19 Epitope Loss
As noted, we have an ongoing development program targeting CD22. Combining CD19-directed therapy and CD22-directed therapy may increase the selection pressure on the cancer and significantly reduce the overall risk of relapse. We are currently testing preclinical constructs to better understand the optimal way to target both CD22 and CD19 in the same CAR T product, with the aim of increasing the rate of durable remissions.
EU Development
As described in more detail under the caption "Licenses and Third-Party Collaborations" below, Celgene has opted in to our CD19 program and thereby has obtained an exclusive license to our CD19 product candidates for development and commercialization outside of North America and China. Celgene now is responsible for development and commercialization of our CD19 product candidates in its territories and is actively planning one or more trials of our CD19 product candidates in the 
-17-

EU. Celgene intends to treat patients in the EU in 2018, with a first regulatory approval in r/r DLBCL potentially as early as 2019. 
Product Candidates in Multiple Myeloma
Another key area of focus for us is the treatment of multiple myeloma, which is a cancer of the plasma cells. Plasma cells are B cells that have matured to specialize in the production of antibodies. As plasma cells are primarily found in the bone marrow, cancerous plasma cells usually generate tumors in bone, and infrequently appear elsewhere. Multiple myeloma is a condition in which these plasma cells become malignant, with a single clone growing at an uncontrolled pace. These myeloma cells secrete large quantities of the same antibody, and patient symptoms can develop from the myeloma cells crowding out other plasma and bone marrow cells, leading to increased risk of infection, risk of bone destruction, and kidney disease. Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic malignancy making up approximately 2% of all cancers. Despite many recent advances in therapy, this form of cancer is still largely fatal and an area of high unmet medical need, with greater than 12,500 deaths estimated to have occurred in 2016.
Multiple myeloma shares some common attributes with B cell malignancies that make it an attractive target for CAR T cell therapy:

• | There are certain cell surface proteins that appear on many multiple myeloma cancer cells with consistency.


• | There are identifiable proteins whose expression is limited to the B cell lineage, decreasing the likelihood of off-target toxicity.


• | Multiple targets have been identified for potential use in CAR T therapy.

Targeting BCMA is an area with significant promise in the treatment of multiple myeloma, and we have begun a Phase I clinical trial with JCARH125 in r/r multiple myeloma. JCARH125 is a CAR T cell product candidate that incorporates several important elements that we believe are important for maximizing patient benefit, including a next-generation manufacturing process, a fully-human binding domain, and a 4-1BB costimulatory domain. We expect early results from this study as we move through 2018. If the results are compelling, we intend to move JCARH125 into a registration study. 
We also have two other CAR T cell product candidates, MCARH171 and FCARH143, that target BCMA being studied in Phase I clinical trials, one at each of MSK and FHCRC, respectively. These trials use manufacturing processes from these academic partners. We intend to use these trials to better understand safety and obtain other translational insights to help us to accelerate our JCARH125 program and our multiple myeloma program more generally. 
We have also licensed rights to binding domains against two multiple myeloma targets other than BCMA that we may also advance to the clinic. In addition, in late 2017, we announced three license agreements to advance our program in multiple myeloma using GSIs in combination with BCMA-directed CAR T cells. Gamma secretase is an enzyme that cleaves a set of transmembrane proteins, including BCMA. Multiple publications have shown that treatment with GSIs can increase surface expression of BCMA on tumors, particularly multiple myeloma. Increased cell surface BCMA may increase potency of a BCMA-directed CAR T therapy. In 2018, we plan to begin clinical trials combining a GSI with one of our BCMA CAR T cell product candidates.
Additional Product Candidates
We are exploring the potential of our CAR and TCR technologies against targets that have the potential to treat cancers beyond B cell malignancies and multiple myeloma—in particular, difficult-to-treat solid organ tumors such as certain breast, lung, and pancreatic cancers. We and our collaborators are working on a number of product candidates in early clinical or late-stage preclinical development that target different cancer proteins associated with solid organ tumors. We have five such candidates in clinical testing against five different targets, with additional product candidates in the preclinical pipeline. 
Glycoprotein Targets: L1CAM (CD171) and Lewis Y
We have two CAR product candidates in the clinic that target glycoproteins, which are proteins that have carbohydrates attached to them, on the cell surface. The first of the targets is L1CAM, also known as CD171, a cell-surface adhesion molecule that plays an important role in the development of a normal nervous system. It is overexpressed in neuroblastoma, and there is increasing evidence of aberrant expression in a variety of solid organ tumors, including glioblastoma and lung, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers. The second of the targets is Lewis Y, which has an aberrant glycosylation when Lewis Y is expressed in multiple types of cancer, such as lung, leukemia, breast, and ovarian cancers. 
-18-

JCAR023 is our L1CAM directed CAR T cell product candidate, which was originally developed at SCRI. It has a defined cell composition. Preliminary data from a non-human primate study has shown no evidence of reactivity of JCAR023 to normal tissues at cell doses 10-100 fold higher than the anticipated target dose in humans. SCRI is conducting a Phase I trial of JCAR023 in in patients with refractory or recurrent pediatric neuroblastoma, under a SCRI IND.
Our Lewis Y-directed CAR T cell product candidate was originally developed by the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. The Lewis Y-directed product candidate is currently being tested in lung cancer patients in a Phase I trial in Australia at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre.
JCAR020: MUC-16 / IL-12
MUC-16 is a protein overexpressed in the majority of ovarian cancers, but not on the surface of normal ovary cells. CA-125 is a protein found in the blood of ovarian cancer patients that results from the cleavage of MUC-16. CA-125 levels in the blood are a common test for ovarian cancer progression because they correlate with cancer progression. Our MUC-16/IL-12 product candidate, JCAR020, which was originally developed at MSK, has a binding domain that recognizes an extracellular domain of MUC-16 that remains following cleavage of CA-125.
JCAR020 is our first development candidate that uses our "armored CAR" technology. IL-12 is a cytokine that can help overcome the inhibitory effects that the tumor micro-environment can have on T cell activity. Systemic delivery of IL-12 has been limited to date by severe side effects, which have included severe hematological toxicity, severe hepatic dysfunction, and immune reactive events such as colitis, some of which resulted in deaths and trial stoppage. However, we believe local delivery to the tumor may provide efficacy while avoiding these side effects. JCAR020 secretes IL-12. Because CAR T cells aggregate at the target protein, IL-12 delivery is likely to concentrate in areas with significant MUC-16 protein expression, in this case, MUC-16 expressing cancers. We believe the armored CAR utilizing IL-12 has the potential to enhance T cell potency and persistence. MSK is conducting a Phase I trial of JCAR020 in ovarian cancer, under an MSK IND. The Phase I trial for JCAR020 opened for enrollment in late 2015, and the trial will continue to enroll patients at ascending doses in 2018. In addition to assessing safety and preliminary efficacy, the trial is designed to provide potential biomarker and translational insights.
JCAR024: ROR-1
ROR-1 is a protein expressed in the formation of embryos, but in normal adult cells its surface expression is predominantly found at low levels on adipocytes, or fat cells, and briefly on precursors to B cells, or pre-B cells, during normal B cell maturation. ROR-1 is overexpressed on a wide variety of cancers including a subset of non-small cell lung cancer, triple negative breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer. It is highly expressed on B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma.
JCAR024 is our ROR-1-directed CAR T cell product candidate, which was originally developed at FHCRC. It has a defined cell composition. Preliminary data in non-human primates has shown no evidence of acute clinically relevant side effects at cell doses exceeding the anticipated target dose in humans. We began a Phase I trial in early 2016 of JCAR024 in patients with ROR-1 expressing cancers, under a FHCRC-sponsored IND. We are also developing a next generation ROR-1-directed CAR T cell product candidate using a fully human binder.
JTCR016: WT-1
Our lead high-affinity TCR T cell product candidate, JTCR016, targets WT-1, an intracellular protein that is overexpressed in a number of cancers, including adult myeloid leukemia ("AML") and non-small cell lung, breast, pancreatic, ovarian, and colorectal cancers. This product candidate was originally developed at FHCRC. 
The first trial to test WT-1 was a Phase I/II trial that began in 2002, under a FHCRC IND, for the treatment of patients who have relapsed or are at a high risk of relapse after having received an allogeneic HSCT for AML, myelodysplasic syndrome, and chronic myeloid leukemia. In preliminary investigator-reported clinical data presented at ASH 2016 from the Phase I dose-escalation portion of the trial, 12 patients who had relapsed and 12 patients with no measurable disease but at high risk of relapse of AML had been treated as of the data cutoff date of November 1, 2016. In these patients, JTCR016 was relatively well-tolerated with prolonged persistence of the engineered T cells and no relapses as of the data cutoff date in the 12 patients at high risk of relapse. In the portion of the trial in which the 12 relapsed patients were treated, there was some early evidence of a direct anti-leukemic effect of JTCR016. Across all patients treated on the trial, treatment-emergent adverse events of Grade 3 and above, whether or not treatment related, occurring in at least 10% of patients included platelet count decreased, lymphocyte count decreased, anemia, neutrophil count decreased, white blood cell count decreased, hyponatremia, and hypotension. FHCRC only collects adverse event data of Grade 3 and above for this trial. There were no observed events of sCRS or severe neurotoxicity in any patients treated with JTCR016 in the trial. 
-19-

In 2015, FHCRC began a second Phase I/II trial of JTCR016, in patients with advanced NSCLC or mesothelioma, under a FHCRC IND. In early clinical data presented at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting 2016 ("AACR 2016") in April 2016 from the Phase I portion of the trial, out of three patients treated as of the data cutoff date of April 1, 2016, one mesothelioma patient had an ongoing partial response and one mesothelioma patient had stable disease after receiving JTCR016. JTCR016 was generally well-tolerated in these three patients, with no evidence of sCRS or severe neurotoxicity. This trial continues to enroll patients.
We have begun a third Phase I/II trial of JTCR016 at FHCRC, in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed high risk AML, under a FHCRC IND. 
We expect additional data to be presented from one or more JTCR016 trials in 2018.
HPV e6/e7 Oncoproteins
Another active area of research for Juno is the possibility of treating cancers that are caused by viruses, such as HPV. Subject to completion of certain preclinical studies, we are planning a Phase I trial to begin in 2019 under a Juno IND with a TCR product candidate targeting the HPV e6/e7 oncoproteins, which are proteins that are expressed in many HPV-associated cancers, including certain cervical cancers and head and neck malignancies. 
IL13rα2
We are developing a CAR product candidate that targets a cytokine receptor, IL13rα2, which is overexpressed on glioblastoma. The New England Journal of Medicine recently published a case study showing a patient who received a non-Juno CAR product candidate directed toward IL13rα2. This case study offers a proof of concept that CAR T cell therapy directed toward IL13rα2 may be efficacious in the treatment of glioblastoma.
We are planning to initiate a Phase I trial in glioblastoma in 2018, subject to completion of certain preclinical studies, using a CAR product candidate directed at IL13rα2.
Process Development and Manufacturing
We are devoting significant resources to process development and manufacturing in order to optimize the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, as well as to reduce our per unit manufacturing costs. The manufacture of our product candidates involves complex processes, including the separation of the appropriate T cells from blood product collected from the patient, the activation of the T cells, the insertion of the gene sequence for the CAR or TCR construct into the cell’s DNA, and the growth in the number of these modified T cells to the desired dose level. We have established a semi-automated, closed platform for this process, and we are investing further resources in improving and further automating the process so as to reduce the cost of manufacturing.
We continue to leverage our relationships with our academic partner institutions for manufacturing for some of our Phase I/II clinical trials. Doing so has significantly accelerated our ability to advance clinical trials, gain insights into the multiple manufacturing processes, and establish an infrastructure for future Phase I and II trials.
Our manufacturing strategy is designed to meet the demand needs of clinical supply and commercial launch, while also pursuing the goal of carefully managing our cost structure, maximizing optionality, and driving long-term cost of goods as low as possible. We have established a Juno owned and operated manufacturing facility in Bothell, Washington, that is manufacturing JCAR017 for the TRANSCEND trial and JCARH125 for the Phase I multiple myeloma trial. . We also have plans to expand our manufacturing capacity in 2018 and 2019. We may also use CMOs for drug product manufacturing in the future if needs require. We believe that operating our own manufacturing facility will provide us with enhanced control of material supply for both clinical trials and the commercial market, will enable the more rapid implementation of process changes, and will allow for better long-term margins. We believe this approach will position us to support multicenter clinical trials and commercialization.
Our manufacturing strategy is currently structured to support our U.S. development plans. Although we believe the general manufacturing strategy developed for the United States will be applicable in other geographies, specific strategies for other geographies will be developed as part of our clinical and commercial plans for such other geographies. As such, we are currently working with Celgene on our strategy for those geographies, such as the EU, where Celgene will be leading the development and commercialization of our CD19 product candidates, and we are working with JW Cayman (defined below) on developing a strategy for manufacturing in China.
-20-

Commercialization Plan
We currently have limited sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities and as a company we have no experience in commercializing products. We are in the process of building our U.S. commercial infrastructure and intend to build our own global commercialization capabilities over time as well as to leverage Celgene’s global capabilities in certain geographies for CD19 product candidates and any other programs that Celgene opts into.
According to Decision Resources Group’s projections, the combined global market for ALL, DLBCL, and CLL combined is expected to be approximately $20 billion by 2025. In the United States alone, there are approximately 6,000 patients diagnosed with ALL, 72,000 patients diagnosed with NHL and another 20,000 diagnosed with CLL each year. If any of our CD19 product candidates are approved, we expect to commercialize those products in the United States with an experienced sales, marketing, payer access and distribution organization including a national specialty hematology sales force.
Outside the United States, we have not yet defined our regulatory and commercial strategy. Under our license agreement with Celgene for the CD19 program, Celgene leads development and commercialization activities outside of North America and China. We expect to further outline our global plan for further development and commercialization of our CD19 product candidates in partnership with Celgene in 2018. With respect to product candidates arising out of other programs that Celgene opts in to, we would expect to leverage Celgene’s global development and commercial capabilities in those territories where Celgene receives development and commercialization rights. With respect to product candidates arising from programs for which Celgene chooses not to exercise its option, we would expect to build global commercial capacity internally or identify strategic partners for ongoing global commercialization of such product candidates, which may include biopharmaceutical partners, distributors, and contract sales and marketing organizations. We plan to further evaluate these alternatives as we approach approval for one of our product candidates.
As additional product candidates advance through our pipeline, our commercial plans will evolve as we consider elements such as the market potential, the unmet clinical need, the competitive landscape, development costs, etc., in order to efficiently and successfully commercialize our assets.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from our collaborators or other third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates, continuing innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of immunotherapy. We additionally rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions when available, and plan to seek and rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations. Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents; and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
We have developed and in-licensed numerous patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of immunotherapy product candidates, including related manufacturing processes and technology. Many of these in-licensed patents and patent applications claim the inventions of investigators at MSK, FHCRC, SCRI, NIH, City of Hope, and St. Jude, as described in more detail below under the caption "Licenses and Third-Party Collaborations." As of December 31, 2017, our owned and licensed patent portfolio includes approximately 38 licensed U.S. issued patents, approximately 39 licensed U.S. pending patent applications, approximately 52 owned U.S. issued patents, and approximately 65 owned U.S. pending patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements, and our most advanced product candidates, as well as approximately 20 owned patents issued in jurisdictions outside the United States, approximately 188 licensed patents issued in jurisdictions outside of the United States, approximately 387 licensed patent applications pending in jurisdictions outside of the United States (including 10 licensed pending Patent Cooperation Treaty applications), and approximately 259 owned patent applications pending in jurisdictions outside of the United States (including 35 owned pending Patent Cooperation Treaty applications) that, in many cases, are counterparts to the foregoing U.S. patents and patent applications. For example, these patents and patent applications include claims directed to:

• | proprietary CARs, T cell receptors and antibodies;

-21-


• | proprietary CAR constructs, including those with customized spacer domains for improved tumor recognition;


• | engineered transgenes for T cell selection, identification, and in vivo ablation;


• | proprietary gene transfer vectors;


• | reversible reagents for cell selection, expansion and engineering;


• | systems, assays, and processes for generating, evaluating, and manufacturing cells and compositions for adoptive immunotherapy;


• | adoptive immunotherapy using defined T cell compositions;


• | multispecific cellular therapy approaches, including bispecific CARs, cells and compositions;


• | formulations, dosages, combinations, and treatment methods for adoptive immunotherapy, including those for predicting risk of and reducing toxicity associated with adoptive immunotherapy;


• | approaches for improving exposure to therapeutic cell product and promoting resistance to factors of tumor microenvironments;


• | diagnostic and prognostic methods and compositions;


• | libraries and high throughput methods for the discovery of antigen-binding molecules and targets;


• | compositions, combinations, and treatment methods related to the modulation of adenosine and/or adenosine receptors; and


• | compositions, combinations, and treatment methods related to the modulation of gamma secretase and/or Notch.

As for the immunotherapy products and processes we develop and commercialize, in the normal course of business, we intend to pursue, when possible, composition, method of use, dosing and formulation patent protection. We may also pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing and drug development processes and technology. 
Individual patents extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. Our patents issued as of December 31, 2017, will expire on dates ranging from 2019 to 2035. If patents are issued on our patent applications pending as of December 31, 2017, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2021 to 2038. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of immunotherapy has emerged in the United States. The patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of our intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products and the methods used to manufacture those products. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. The area of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our patented product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated, 
-22-

or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our product candidates. For example, in 2015, Kite Pharma, Inc. ("Kite") filed a petition with the USPTO for inter partes review of U.S. Patent No. 7,446,190, a patent that we have exclusively licensed from MSK. Although the USPTO upheld all the claims of this patent in December 2016, Kite has appealed this decision. If Kite is successful in its appeal, one or more of the patent's claims could be narrowed or invalidated. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. For these reasons, we may have competition for our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.
Patent disputes are sometimes interwoven into other business disputes. For example, we were a party in a lawsuit captioned Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania v. St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Civil Action No. 2:13-cv-01502-SD (E.D. Penn.), which concerned both a contractual dispute between St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital ("St. Jude") and the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania ("Penn"), and a dispute about U.S. Patent No. 8,399,645 (the "’645 Patent"), which St. Jude has exclusively licensed to us. This lawsuit settled in April 2015.
As of December 31, 2017, our registered trademark portfolio currently contains 61 registered trademarks and pending trademark applications, consisting of 4 trademark registrations and 5 pending trademark applications in the United States, and 28 registered trademarks and 24 pending trademark applications in the following countries through both national filings and under the Madrid Protocol: Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, the European Union (including Germany), India, Japan, Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Switzerland. We may also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, please see the section captioned "Risks Related to Intellectual Property" in Part I—Item 1A—"Risk Factors" of this report.
Licenses and Third-Party Collaborations
Celgene Corporation
Collaboration Agreement
In June 2015, we entered into a master research and collaboration agreement (the "Celgene Collaboration Agreement") with Celgene pursuant to which Juno and Celgene will research, develop and commercialize novel cellular therapy product candidates and other immuno-oncology and immunology therapeutics, including, in particular, CAR and TCR product candidates. The Celgene Collaboration Agreement became effective on July 31, 2015 and was amended and restated in August 2015 to clarify certain procedural aspects relating to a party’s exercise of an option for a given program, and to provide additional detail regarding a party’s entry into the applicable development and commercialization agreement thereafter. Pursuant to the collaboration, each of Celgene and Juno will conduct independent programs to research, develop, and commercialize such product candidates (including, in the case of Juno, our CD19 and CD22 programs). As detailed below, each party has certain options to obtain either an exclusive license to develop and commercialize specified product candidates arising from specified types of programs conducted by the other party within the scope of the collaboration, or the right to participate in the co-development and co-commercialization of specified product candidates arising from such programs. BCMA-directed product candidates are excluded from the collaboration.
The parties may exercise their options with respect to specified product candidates arising under programs within the scope of the collaboration until July 31, 2025, which is the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Celgene Collaboration Agreement (the "Research Collaboration Term"), subject to a tail period applicable to certain programs, for which options have not yet been exercised as of the expiration of the Research Collaboration Term. For therapeutic product candidates that are directed to the target of a program for which an option is exercised, but for which the party exercising its option has not elected to obtain rights upon option exercise, each party is obligated during the remainder of the Research Collaboration Term to 
-23-

continue to offer the other party the right to exercise an additional option to obtain rights to develop and commercialize such other product candidates in such program until commencement of a pivotal clinical trial, upon terms set forth in the Celgene Collaboration Agreement. If a party does not exercise its option with respect to a program that is subject to the other party’s exclusive right to exercise an option prior to the expiration of all applicable option exercise periods for such product candidates in such program, the option with respect to such product candidates and such program will expire and the party required to offer such product candidates and program to the other party is free to develop and commercialize such product candidates independently.
Pursuant to the Celgene Collaboration Agreement, each party is solely responsible for research and development activities conducted under its programs prior to the other party’s exercise of an option. Following a party’s exercise of its option for a program, the parties will enter into an agreed form of license agreement or co-development and co-commercialization agreement for such program, as applicable, which agreement will set forth the allocation of rights and responsibilities as between the parties for development and commercialization activities for product candidates arising out of such program in the Celgene Territory and the Juno Territory, as applicable (as each is defined below).
Options under Celgene Collaboration Agreement
First, we granted Celgene options to obtain an exclusive license with respect to Juno’s internally conducted programs, to develop and commercialize specified types of immuno-oncology and immunology therapeutics that are selected by Celgene at the time it exercises such options and are directed to the molecular targets that are the subject of the relevant Juno programs. Juno will retain the right to develop and commercialize product candidates arising from such programs in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and for cellular therapy product candidates, China (such countries, the "Juno Territory" and all other countries, the "Celgene Territory"). Celgene may exercise the foregoing options on a program-by-program basis at various time points through completion of certain clinical trials with respect to product candidates in each program. Upon Celgene’s exercise of such option for specified product candidates for a program, the parties are obligated to enter into either a license agreement or a co-development and co-commercialization agreement as specified below.
If Celgene exercises an option with respect to our internally developed programs within the scope of the collaboration, as it has for our CD19 program, Juno and Celgene will enter into an agreed form of a license agreement pursuant to which Celgene receives an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize, at Celgene’s cost, specified therapeutic product candidates directed to the targets of such Juno programs in the Celgene Territory, and Juno retains all rights to develop further and commercialize, at Juno’s cost, such therapeutic product candidates in the Juno Territory, subject to Celgene’s right to exercise an option for a specified number of such programs, excluding the CD19 program and the CD22 program, to co-promote such product candidates in the Juno Territory (in which case the parties would execute a co-development and co-commercialization agreement as specified below). Under all such license agreements, Juno has the right to participate in specified commercialization activities arising from such programs in certain major European markets.
For internally developed Juno programs for which Celgene exercises one of its specified number of rights to co-develop and co-commercialize product candidates arising in such program, as described above, the parties shall enter into an agreed form of co-development and co-commercialization agreement, pursuant to which Celgene shall have the right to co-develop and co-commercialize such product candidates, with the parties each entitled to bear and receive an equal share of the profits and losses arising out of such programs following the exercise of such co-promote right. In general, under such agreements, Juno will be the lead party for development and commercialization activities for such product candidates in the Juno Territory, and Celgene will be the lead party for development and commercialization activities for such product candidates in the Celgene Territory. Under such agreements, Celgene has the right to elect to participate in up to a specified percentage of specified commercialization activities for such product candidates in the Juno Territory, and Juno has the right to elect to participate in up to a specified percentage of specified commercialization activities for such product candidates in certain major European markets.
If Juno exercises its option with respect to specified product candidates arising in internally developed Celgene programs within the scope of the collaboration, the parties are obligated to enter into a co-development and co-commercialization agreement pursuant to which Juno bears thirty percent (30%) and Celgene bears seventy percent (70%) of global profits and losses. Under such co-development and co-commercialization agreements, Celgene is the lead party for all development and commercialization activities for such product candidates worldwide, subject to Juno’s right to participate in up to a specified percentage of specified commercialization activities in North America under certain circumstances and in certain major European countries.
Furthermore, each party will have the exclusive right to exercise options to co-develop and co-commercialize product candidates arising out of programs for which the other party in-licenses or acquires rights that are within the scope of their collaboration, where such rights are available to be granted, with the parties each bearing an equal share of the profits and 
-24-

losses arising out of such programs following the exercise of such option. In general, for such programs where the rights are in-licensed or acquired by Juno and for which Celgene exercises its options, Juno will be the lead party for development and commercialization of product candidates arising from such programs in the Juno Territory, subject to Celgene’s right to elect to participate in certain commercialization activities for such product candidates in the Juno Territory, and Celgene will be the lead party for development and commercialization of product candidates arising in such programs in the Celgene Territory, subject to Juno’s right to elect to participate in certain commercialization activities for such product candidates in certain major European markets. Conversely, for such programs where the rights are in-licensed or acquired by Celgene and for which Juno exercises its options, Celgene will be the lead party for development and commercialization activities for product candidates arising from such programs on a worldwide basis, subject to Juno’s right to elect to participate in certain commercialization activities for such product candidates in the Juno Territory and in certain major European markets. The party exercising an option for these in-licensed or acquired programs is required to pay to the other party an upfront payment equal to one half of the costs incurred by other party in connection with the acquisition of rights to such programs.
In addition to an upfront cash payment of approximately $150.2 million under the Celgene Collaboration Agreement made by Celgene upon its effectiveness, Celgene is required to pay to Juno an additional upfront fee if Celgene exercises its option for each of the CD19 Program and the CD22 Program, totaling, if the options are exercised for both programs during the initial opt-in window, $100.0 million. In April 2016, Celgene paid us $50.0 million upon its exercise of its option for the CD19 Program. Upon a party’s exercise of the option for any other program (other than certain in-licensed or acquired programs where a party exercises its option at the time such program is acquired), the party exercising the option is required to pay to the other party an upfront payment at the time of exercise of its option, calculated as a multiple of the costs incurred by the other party in relation to the development activities for such program prior to the exercise of the option, with such multiple based on the point in development of such product at which such party exercises such option. For programs for which the parties have entered into a license agreement, Juno will also receive royalties from Celgene, for product candidates arising from the CD19 and CD22 programs, at a percentage in the mid-teens of net sales of such product candidates in the Celgene Territory, and for product candidates arising from other Juno programs that are subject to a license agreement, tiered royalties on net sales of such product candidates in the Celgene Territory, at percentages ranging from the high single digits to the mid-teens, calculated based on the stage of development at which Celgene exercises its option for such program.
In addition to each party’s rights with respect to development and commercialization of product candidates arising from programs in the collaboration as set forth above, the parties have agreed to enter into a manufacturing and supply agreement that will govern the terms of manufacture and supply of cellular therapy product candidates and other product candidates included within collaboration programs following the exercise of an option for each such program. Under this agreement, Juno would manufacture and supply cellular therapy product candidates for the Juno Territory, and provide certain support for the manufacture and supply of cellular therapy product candidates for the Celgene Territory. Celgene would be responsible for the supply of other types of product candidates for which options are exercised.
The Celgene Collaboration Agreement will terminate upon the later of the last-to-expire of all option exercise periods, or, if an option is exercised by a party for one or more programs in the collaboration, upon the termination or expiration of the last-to-exist license agreement or co-development and co-commercialization agreement, as applicable, for any such program. The Celgene Collaboration Agreement may be terminated by either party for the insolvency of, or for an uncured material breach of the Celgene Collaboration Agreement by, the other party. Celgene may terminate the Celgene Collaboration Agreement in its entirety for any reason by providing Juno with prior written notice if there are no active development and commercialization agreements in place. Juno may terminate the Celgene Collaboration Agreement if Juno exercises its termination rights under the Voting and Standstill Agreement (as defined below) between the Parties for Celgene’s breach of certain covenants therein, or if either party terminates the 2015 Celgene SPA (as defined below) other than as a result of a failure by Juno to meet specified closing conditions under such agreement. Either party also has the right to terminate the Celgene Collaboration Agreement on a program-by-program basis if the other party or any of its affiliates challenges the validity, scope or enforceability of or otherwise opposes, any patent included within the intellectual property rights licensed to the other party under the Celgene Collaboration Agreement.
On a program-by-program basis and prior to the exercise of an option, either party may terminate the Celgene Collaboration Agreement either in its entirety or with respect to one or more programs on prior written notice to the other party in the case of an uncured material breach by the other party that frustrates the fundamental purpose of the Celgene Collaboration Agreement,. On a program-by-program basis following the exercise of an option for a program, either Party may also terminate any license agreement, or co-development and co-commercialization agreement for such program upon prior notice for an uncured material breach by the other party with respect to such program that frustrates the fundamental purpose of such agreement. Either party may terminate a license agreement or co-development and co-commercialization agreement upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. Either party also has the right to terminate the license agreement or the co-development and co-commercialization agreement if the other party or any of its affiliates challenges the validity, scope or enforceability of or otherwise opposes, any patent included within the intellectual property rights licensed to the other party under such agreement.

CD19 License Agreement
In April 2016, Celgene exercised its opt-in right to develop and commercialize product candidates from our CD19 program in the Celgene Territory. As a result, we entered into a license agreement with Celgene (the "Celgene CD19 License") pursuant to which Celgene received an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize therapeutic CAR product candidates from our CD19 program in the Celgene Territory. Juno retains all rights to develop further and commercialize such product candidates in the Juno Territory, except that Juno has authorized Celgene to conduct certain clinical trials in the United States with respect to certain CD19 combination therapies. Juno and Celgene will generally share worldwide research and development costs for certain CD19 product candidates, although either party may opt out of funding specific studies led by the other. Juno will be responsible for commercialization costs in the Juno Territory and Celgene will be responsible for commercialization costs in the Celgene Territory. Juno has the right to participate in specified commercialization activities for licensed products arising from the CD19 program in certain major European markets. Celgene has the right to participate in specified commercialization activities in North America for licensed products for certain indications under the CD19 program. We received a $50.0 million option exercise fee from Celgene upon the exercise of Celgene’s option for the CD19 program. We will also receive royalties from Celgene for CAR product candidates arising from the CD19 program at a percentage in the mid-teens of net sales of such product candidates in the Celgene Territory.
The term of the Celgene CD19 License will expire on the last to expire royalty payment obligation of Celgene under that agreement. Such royalty payment obligation will expire, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and a country-by-country basis, after sales of such licensed product decline to specified levels following the latest of (i) the expiration of the last to expire Juno patent licensed to Celgene covering such licensed product in such country, (ii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such licensed product in such country, and (iii) a specified anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country.
Celgene may terminate the Celgene CD19 License in its entirety upon prior written notice. Celgene also has the right to terminate the Celgene CD19 License, on a product candidate-by-product candidate basis, immediately upon written notice to Juno upon the occurrence of certain safety events. Either Juno or Celgene may terminate the Celgene CD19 License upon prior written notice for an uncured material breach by the other party that frustrates the fundamental purpose of the Celgene CD19 License. Either Juno or Celgene may terminate the Celgene CD19 License upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party, or if the other party or any of its affiliates challenges the validity, scope or enforceability of or otherwise opposes, any patent included within the intellectual property rights licensed to the other party under the Celgene CD19 License. Juno may also terminate the Celgene CD19 License immediately for certain breaches by Celgene of the voting and standstill agreement between Celgene and Juno.
Equity Placement
In June 2015, we also entered into a share purchase agreement (the "2015 Celgene SPA") with Celgene. Pursuant to the 2015 Celgene SPA, we agreed to sell 9,137,672 shares of our common stock to Celgene at an aggregate cash price of approximately $849.8 million, or $93.00 per share of common stock, at an initial closing. The initial closing occurred on August 4, 2015.
First Period Top-Up Rights
Starting in 2016 and until June 29, 2020, Celgene has the annual right, following the filing of each Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by Juno (including this report), to purchase additional shares from Juno at a market average price, allowing it to "top up" to an ownership interest equal to 10% of the then-outstanding shares (after giving effect to such purchase), subject to adjustment downward in certain circumstances. If Celgene does not exercise its top-up right in full in any given year, then the percentage of ownership targeted for a top-up stock purchase for the next year will be reduced to Celgene’s percentage ownership at the time of such non-exercise or partial exercise (after giving effect to the issuance of shares in any partial exercise). 
In March 2016, Celgene exercised its annual top-up right to purchase 1,137,593 shares at a price of $41.32 per share, for an aggregate cash purchase price of $47.0 million. As Celgene in March 2016 did not exercise the top-up right in full to reach 10% ownership that would have been permitted by the top-up right, the top-up right that was triggered by the filing of the 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K permitted Celgene to top-up its ownership stake in the Company to 9.76%. 
In March 2017, Celgene exercised its annual top-up right to purchase 75,568 shares at a price of $22.39 per share, for an aggregate cash purchase price of $1.7 million. The top-up right that will be triggered by the filing of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 will only permit Celgene to top-up its ownership stake of the Company’s common stock to 9.76%. 
-26-

Based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of February 21, 2018 as set forth on the cover of this report, we estimate that Celgene will have the right to acquire approximately 241,000 shares of our common stock if it exercises the "top up" right triggered by the filing of this report.
First Acquisition Right
During the period beginning on June 29, 2019 and ending on June 28, 2020, subject to Celgene opting in to a certain number of Juno programs under the Celgene Collaboration Agreement, Celgene will have the right (the "First Acquisition Right") to purchase up to 19.99% of the then-outstanding shares of Juno’s common stock (after giving effect to such purchase) at the closing price of the common stock on the principal trading market (currently The Nasdaq Global Select Market) on the date of exercise (the "FAR Base Price"), plus a premium on all shares in excess of the number of shares for which Celgene would then be able to purchase if it then had a top-up right as described in the preceding paragraph.
Second Period Top-Up Rights
After the closing of the purchase of shares upon the exercise of the First Acquisition Right until the SAR Termination Date (as defined below), in the event that Celgene has been diluted after exercising the First Acquisition Right, Juno may elect annually, upon the filing of each Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by Juno, to offer Celgene the right to purchase additional shares from Juno at 105% of market average price, allowing Celgene to "top up" to an ownership interest (after giving effect to such purchase) equal to the percentage ownership of shares that Celgene obtained upon exercise of the First Acquisition Right, subject to adjustment downward in certain circumstances. If Celgene does not exercise its top-up right in full in any year in which it is offered such right by Juno, then the percentage of ownership targeted for a top-up stock purchase for the next year it is offered such top-up right will be reduced to Celgene’s percentage ownership at the time of such non-exercise or partial exercise (after giving effect to the issuance of shares in any partial exercise). The "SAR Termination Date" is the later of (a) June 29, 2025, and (b) the earlier of (x) the date that is 6 months following the date that the conditions to the exercise of the Second Acquisition Right (as defined herein) are satisfied and (y) December 29, 2025.
Second Acquisition Right
During the period beginning on June 29, 2024 and ending on the SAR Termination Date, subject to each of Celgene and Juno opting into a certain number of programs under the Celgene Collaboration Agreement, and provided that Celgene exercised the First Acquisition Right so as to obtain a percentage ownership of 17% of Juno, Celgene will have the right (the "Second Acquisition Right") to purchase up to 30% of the then-outstanding shares of Juno’s common stock (after giving effect to such purchase) at the closing price of the common stock on the principal trading market on the date of exercise (the "SAR Base Price"), plus a premium on all shares in excess of the number of shares for which Celgene would then be able to purchase if it then had a top-up right as described in the preceding paragraph.
Final Top-Up Rights
Following the closing of the purchase of shares upon the exercise of the Second Acquisition Right and until the Celgene Collaboration Agreement expires or is terminated, Celgene would have the annual right, in the event that Celgene has been diluted after exercising the Second Acquisition Right, following the filing of each Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by Juno, to purchase additional shares from Juno at a price equal to 105% of market average price, allowing it to "top up" to the percentage ownership it had attained upon exercising the Second Acquisition Right, less 250 basis points, subject to adjustment downward in certain circumstances. If Celgene does not exercise its top-up right in full in any given year, then the percentage of ownership targeted for a top-up stock purchase for the next year will be reduced to Celgene’s percentage ownership at the time of such non-exercise or partial exercise (after giving effect to the issuance of shares in any partial exercise).
These rights and the other described top-up rights, as well as the First Acquisition Right and Second Acquisition Right, may be limited or eliminated in certain circumstances when and if Celgene disposes of any of its shares.
Conditions to Closing; Termination; Stockholder Approval
Closings of top-up rights, the First Acquisition Right, and the Second Acquisition Right, are subject to customary closing conditions, including termination or expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. We have the ability to terminate Celgene’s future purchase rights under the 2015 Celgene SPA in the event that Celgene breaches certain of its obligations under the Voting and Standstill Agreement (described below), Celgene undergoes a change in control, or the Celgene Collaboration Agreement terminates or expires.
-27-

Voting and Standstill Agreement
In connection with the 2015 Celgene SPA, we entered into a voting and standstill agreement (the "Voting and Standstill Agreement") with Celgene in June 2015. Pursuant to the Voting and Standstill Agreement, until the later of the fifth anniversary of the date of the Voting and Standstill Agreement and the expiration or earlier termination of the Celgene Collaboration Agreement, Celgene will be bound by certain "standstill" provisions which generally will prevent it from purchasing outstanding shares of Juno common stock or common stock equivalents, making a tender offer or encouraging or supporting a third party tender offer, calling a meeting of Juno’s stockholders, nominating a director whose nomination has not been approved by the Board, soliciting proxies in opposition to the recommendation of the Board, depositing shares of common stock in a voting trust, assisting a third party in taking such actions, entering into discussions with a third party as to such actions, or requesting or proposing in writing to the Board or any member thereof that Juno amend or waive any of these limitations. However, the Voting and Standstill Agreement contains an exception to the foregoing standstill restrictions on Celgene's actions in the event that any such action is approved by Juno, as is the case for the Offer, which is part of a negotiated transaction that was approved by the Board. In addition, as part of the negotiated transaction with Celgene, Juno agreed to a customary “fall away” provision that would cause the standstill provisions by which Celgene is bound to be suspended upon the occurrence of certain events, including the entry into a definitive acquisition agreement with a third party other than Celgene or a tender offer or exchange offer initiated by any person other than Celgene or its affiliates in which Juno recommends acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer. 
Further, under the Voting and Standstill Agreement, Celgene has also agreed not to dispose of any shares of common stock beneficially owned by it during certain specified lock-up periods, other than under certain exceptions. Following the expiration of such lock-up periods, Celgene may sell shares subject to certain manner of sale and volume limitations, as well as restrictions on sales to persons defined as "competitors." Celgene has agreed generally to vote its shares in accordance with the recommendations of the majority of Juno’s Board.
We have agreed to give Celgene certain Board designation rights until at least June 29, 2020, and thereafter for as long as Celgene and its affiliates beneficially own at least 7.5% of the voting power of Juno’s outstanding shares. Dr. Thomas O. Daniel was Celgene’s original designee on the Board. On April 13, 2017, Celgene designated, and our Board appointed, Rupert Vessey, M.A., B.M. B.ch., FRCP, D. Phil., as Celgene's new designee on the Board. Juno has agreed to nominate Dr. Vessey for election and reelection as a director on the Board, provided in each case that Dr. Vessey is reasonably acceptable to the nominating and governance committee of the Board. Celgene may designate another nominee to replace Dr. Vessey upon Dr. Vessey's departure from the Board or as a replacement nominee for election at a meeting of stockholders at which such position is up for election. Any subsequent designee may not be an employee or officer of Celgene, must be independent under Nasdaq rules, and must be reasonably acceptable to the nominating and governance committee of the Board. 
The rights and restrictions applicable to Celgene under the Voting and Standstill Agreement are subject to termination upon the occurrence of certain events, including certain events involving a change of control, or potential change of control, of Juno.
Registration Rights Agreement
In connection with the 2015 Celgene SPA, we also entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Celgene Registration Rights Agreement") with Celgene in June 2015. Pursuant to the Celgene Registration Rights Agreement, if and as Celgene is permitted to sell shares under the Voting and Standstill Agreement, Juno has agreed to, upon the written request of Celgene, prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a registration statement on Form S-3 for purposes of registering the resale of the shares specified in Celgene’s written request or, if Juno is not at such time eligible for the use of Form S-3, use its commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file a registration statement on a Form S-1 or alternative form that permits the resale of the shares. Juno has also agreed, among other things, to indemnify Celgene under the registration statement from certain liabilities and to pay all fees and expenses (excluding any legal fees of the selling holder(s) above $10,000 per registration statement, and any underwriting discounts and selling commissions) incident to the Juno’s obligations under the Celgene Registration Rights Agreement.
September 2017 Private Placement
On September 21, 2017, we entered into a share purchase agreement and omnibus amendment (the "2017 Celgene SPA") with Celgene pursuant to which we agreed to sell and Celgene agreed to buy 758,327 shares of Juno’s common stock in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, at a sale price equal to the price to the public in a concurrent public offering, $41.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $31.1 million. The number of shares sold to Celgene constituted approximately 9.76% of the aggregate number of the shares sold in the public offering and the private placement to Celgene. The 2017 Celgene SPA also amended the terms of the Voting and Standstill Agreement and the Celgene Registration Rights Agreement in order to subject the shares purchased in the 2017 Celgene SPA to the same terms and conditions under such agreements as if the shares had been purchased pursuant to the 2015 Celgene SPA.
-28-

Merger Agreement
On January 21, 2018, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Celgene Corp. and Purchaser, as described above under the caption "Merger Agreement." If the proposed acquisition is consummated, Juno would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celgene Corp.
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center License and Collaboration Agreement
In October 2013, we entered into a license agreement with FHCRC that grants us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain patent rights, and a non-exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain technology, to research, develop, manufacture, improve, and commercialize products and processes covered by such patent rights or incorporating such technology for all therapeutic uses for the treatment of human cancer. This agreement was amended and restated in November 2014, and further amended in October 2015 and March 2016 to add additional patent assets and associated payment obligations to the agreement. The patents and patent applications covered by this agreement are directed, in part, to CAR constructs, including target specific constructs and customized spacer regions, TCR constructs, and their use for immunotherapy. Pursuant to this license agreement, as of December 31, 2017, we have rights to one issued U.S. patent, five pending U.S. patent applications, four issued patents in jurisdictions outside the United States, and a number of other patent applications in jurisdictions outside the United States. We paid to FHCRC an upfront payment of $250,000 upon entering into this agreement. We are required to pay to FHCRC an annual maintenance fee of $50,000 for the first four years of the agreement’s term and thereafter minimum annual royalties of $100,000 per year, with such payments reduced by the amount of running royalties paid to FHCRC in the applicable prior year. With respect to technology licensed under the license agreement that is applicable to JCAR014 and JCAR017, we may be obligated to pay to FHCRC up to a maximum of $6.75 million per licensed product upon our achievement of certain specified clinical and regulatory milestones. In addition, the license agreement provides that we are required to pay to FHCRC low single-digit royalties based on annual net sales of the licensed products by us and by our sublicensees. We are also required to pay to FHCRC a portion of the payments that we receive from sublicensees of the rights licensed to us by FHCRC, on a tiered basis, up to a cap. In addition, we have agreed to use a set amount of these sublicensee payments to support the research and development of licensed products, and if, by the fifth anniversary of the license agreement, we have received at least such amount in sublicensee payments but have spent less than such amount on such research and development activities, we must pay to FHCRC the difference between such set amount and the actual amounts we have spent on such activities.
The license agreement will expire on the later of the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents rights covering a licensed product, on a country-by-country basis, or 15 years following the regulatory approval of the first licensed product. We may terminate the agreement at will upon 90 days’ notice, in its entirety, on a country-by-country basis, or with respect to any aspect of any licensed patent. FHCRC has the right to terminate the agreement upon 90 days’ notice in the event of our uncured breach, but upon 45 days’ notice if such breach is of a payment or reporting obligation, and upon written notice if we are more than three days late with any payment obligation on any two occasions within a 12-month period. FHCRC may also terminate the agreement upon 30 days’ written notice if we challenge, or notify FHCRC that we intend to challenge, the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patent rights, and the agreement will terminate automatically in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon termination, but not expiration, of the agreement, we are required, upon FHCRC’s request, to timely enter into good faith negotiations with FHCRC’s future licensees for the purpose of granting licensing rights to our modifications to or improvements upon the licensed patents or technologies.
Also in October 2013, we entered into a collaboration agreement with FHCRC relating to the research and development of cellular immunotherapy products. The research is conducted under project orders containing plans and budgets approved by the parties. We have an exclusive option to obtain a royalty-bearing license to intellectual property owned by FHCRC that is developed in connection with the work conducted under the collaboration agreement, such license to be exclusive with respect to patents and patent applications and non- exclusive with respect to any other intellectual property. In addition, FHCRC granted us an exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, sublicensable license to any such intellectual property that constitutes an improvement to any process used to manufacture any human cellular and tissue-based collaboration study product, for the development and/or commercialization of cellular immunotherapy products.
The term of the collaboration agreement shall continue for six years from the effective date, unless earlier terminated. Either party may terminate the collaboration agreement, in its entirety or with respect to a particular collaboration project, upon 30 days’ prior written notice in the case of the other party’s uncured material breach. Either we or FHCRC may also terminate upon written notice in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency.
In connection with the collaboration agreement in October 2013, we entered into a letter agreement with FHCRC pursuant to which we issued to FHCRC 3,274,998 shares of our common stock and also agreed to make success payments to FHCRC, payable in cash or publicly-traded equity at our discretion. In December 2015, we amended this letter agreement to make 
-29-

certain clarifying amendments thereto. These success payments are based on increases in the per share fair market value of our common stock during the term of the success payment agreement, which is a period of time that begins on the date of our collaboration agreement with FHCRC and ends on the later of: (1) the eighth anniversary of that date and (2) the earlier of (a) the eleventh anniversary of that date and (b) the third anniversary of the first date on which the FDA issues formal written approval for us to market a pharmaceutical or biologic product developed at least in part by our company. Success payments are owed (if applicable) after measurement of the value of our common stock in connection with the following valuation measurement dates during the term of the success payment agreement: (1) December 19, 2014 (the date our common stock first became publicly traded upon our initial public offering); (2) the date on which we sell, lease, transfer, or exclusively license all or substantially all of our assets to another company; (3) the date on which we merge or consolidate with or into another entity (other than a merger in which our pre-merger stockholders own a majority of the shares of the surviving entity); (4) any date on which ARCH Venture Fund VII, L.P. or C.L. Alaska L.P. transfers a majority of its shares of company capital stock held by it on such date to a third party; (5) every second anniversary of any event described in the preceding clauses (1), (2), (3) or (4), but only upon a request by FHCRC made within 20 calendar days after receiving written notice from us of such event; and (6) the last day of the term of the success payment agreement. Any success payment will generally be made within 90 days after the applicable valuation measurement date, except that (1) in the case of an initial public offering, the payment was required on December 21, 2015, which was the first business day following the first anniversary of the date our common stock first became publicly traded upon our initial public offering, and (2) in the case of a merger or sale of all of our company’s assets, the success payment will be made on the earlier of the 90th day following the transaction or the first date that transaction proceeds are paid to any of our stockholders. In the case of an initial public offering, the value of our common stock for determining whether a success payment was owed was determined by the average closing price of a share of our common stock over the consecutive 90 calendar day period preceding December 19, 2015, which was the first anniversary of the date our common stock first became publicly traded following our initial public offering. In the case of a valuation measurement date triggered by each second anniversary of our stock first becoming publicly traded, the value of our common stock for determining whether a success payment is owed will be determined by the average closing price of a share of our common stock over the consecutive 90 calendar day period preceding such anniversary date, so long as our common stock is publicly tradable during such 90 calendar day period. On all other valuation measurement dates (if any), the value will be determined either, in the case of a merger or stock sale, by the consideration paid in the transaction for each share of our stock or, in all other cases, by a baseball arbitration process. The amount of a success payment is determined based on whether the value of our common stock meets or exceeds certain specified threshold values ascending from $20.00 per share to $160.00 per share, in each case subject to adjustment for any stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, or other similar events. Each threshold is associated with a success payment, ascending from $10.0 million at $20.00 per share to $375.0 million at $160.00 per share, payable if such threshold is reached. Any previous success payments made to FHCRC are credited against the success payment owed as of any valuation measurement date, so that FHCRC does not receive multiple success payments in connection with the same threshold. The success payments paid to FHCRC will not exceed, in aggregate, $375.0 million, which would be owed only when the value of the common stock reaches $160.00 per share. In June 2014, we entered into an agreement with FHCRC to provide that certain indirect costs related to the collaboration projects conducted by FHCRC are creditable against any success payments, and we amended this agreement in December 2015. If we elect to make a success payment in shares of our common stock, the number of shares to be issued is computed by dividing the dollar amount of the success payment by the volume weighted average trading price of a share of our common stock on the trading day preceding the date on which the success payment is made.
In December 2015, success payments to FHCRC were triggered in the aggregate amount of $75.0 million, less indirect cost offsets of $3.3 million. We elected to make the payment in shares of our common stock, and thereby issued 1,601,085 shares of our common stock to FHCRC in December 2015.
The completion of the Offer would trigger a success payment valuation measurement date, and success payments of $100 million, less indirect cost offsets, would be owed to FHCRC.
Memorial Sloan Kettering License and Research Agreement
In November 2013, we entered into a license agreement with MSK that grants us a worldwide, sublicensable license to certain patent rights and intellectual property rights related to certain know-how to develop, make, and commercialize licensed products and to perform services for all therapeutic and diagnostic uses, which license is exclusive with respect to such patent rights and tangible materials within such know-how, and nonexclusive with respect to such know-how and related intellectual property rights. The patents and patent applications covered by this agreement are directed, in part, to CAR constructs, including bispecific and armored CARs, and their use for immunotherapy. Pursuant to this license agreement, as of December 31, 2017, we have rights to three issued U.S. patents, six pending U.S. patent applications, and a number of other patents and patent applications in jurisdictions outside the United States. Upon entering the agreement, we paid MSK an upfront payment of $6.9 million, and we are required to pay to MSK annual minimum royalties of $100,000 commencing on 
-30-

the fifth anniversary of the license agreement, with such payments creditable against royalties. The license agreement requires us to pay to MSK mid-to-high single-digit royalties based on annual net sales of licensed products or the performance of licensed services by us and our affiliates and sublicensees, which royalty will be reduced in the case of licensed products or services that are not covered by a valid patent in the country in which such products or services are manufactured or commercialized. In addition, if the first product we commercialize contains a chimeric antigen receptor T cell that is not a licensed product under the terms of the agreement, we are required to pay to MSK a below-single-digit royalty on net sales of such product for ten years after the first commercial sale of such product. We may also be obligated to pay to MSK up to a maximum of $6.75 million in clinical and regulatory milestone payments for each licensed product, which includes JCAR015. 
The license agreement will expire, on a country-by-country and licensed-product-by-licensed-product and/or licensed-service-by-licensed-service basis, until the later of the expiration of the last to expire of the patents and patent applications covering such licensed product or service, the expiration of any market exclusivity period granted by a regulatory authority for such licensed product or service in such country, ten years from the first commercial sale of such licensed product or service in such country, or ten years from the first commercial sale of such licensed product or service in such country, where such product or service was never covered by a valid patent or patent application in such country. Upon the expiration of the agreement in any country for a particular licensed product, we will retain a nonexclusive, royalty-free license in such country to the licensed know-how useful to manufacture or commercialize such product. MSK may terminate the license agreement upon 90 days’ notice in the event of our uncured material breach, or upon 30 days’ notice if such breach is of a payment obligation. MSK may also terminate the agreement upon written notice in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency or our conviction of a felony relating to the licensed products, or if we challenge the validity or enforceability of any licensed patent right. In addition, we have the right to terminate the agreement in its entirety at will upon 30 days’ notice to MSK, but if we have commenced the commercialization of licensed products we can only terminate at will if we cease all development and commercialization of licensed products.
Also in November 2013, we entered into a master sponsored research agreement, which we refer to as the MSRA, with MSK focused on research and development relating to chimeric antigen receptor T cell technology. The research is conducted under project orders containing plans and budgets approved by the parties. We have an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license to intellectual property owned by MSK developed in connection with the work conducted under the MSRA, and an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to MSK’s interest in any improvements to the intellectual property licensed by us to MSK for conducting a research project. If the exclusive license agreement with MSK described above is still in effect, any such intellectual property licensed by us pursuant to our exercise of either such option shall be included within the rights licensed to us under the exclusive license agreement, although we may agree to additional diligence and other obligations. The term of the MSRA shall continue until the activities set forth in each statement of work entered into under the MSRA are completed. The MSRA may be terminated by either party upon 90 days’ notice in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach. MSK may terminate the MSRA upon 30 days’ notice in the event of our uncured failure to make a payment.
Also in November 2013, we entered into a master clinical study agreement, which we refer to as the MCSA, for clinical studies to be conducted at MSK on our behalf. Each such clinical study will be conducted in accordance with a written plan and budget and protocol approved by the parties. We have an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license to intellectual property owned by MSK developed in connection with the work conducted under the MCSA, and an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to MSK’s interest in any improvements to the intellectual property licensed by us to MSK to conduct any clinical study under the MCSA. If the exclusive license agreement with MSK described above is still in effect, any such intellectual property licensed by us pursuant to our exercise of either such option shall be automatically included within the rights licensed to us under the exclusive license agreement. The MCSA has a term of five years and may be terminated by either party upon 30 days’ notice in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach, or upon written notice in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency.
In connection with these arrangements, in November 2013 we entered into a letter agreement with MSK pursuant to which we issued to MSK 500,000 shares of our common stock and agreed to make success payments to MSK, payable in cash or publicly-traded equity at our discretion. In December 2015, we amended this letter agreement to make certain clarifying amendments thereto. These success payments are based on increases in the per share fair market value of our common stock during the term of the success payment agreement, which is a period of time that begins on the date of our research agreement with MSK and ends on the later of (1) the eighth anniversary of that date and (2) the earlier of (a) the 11th anniversary of that date and (b) the third anniversary of the first date on which the FDA issues formal written approval for us to market a pharmaceutical or biologic product developed at least in part by our company. Success payments will be owed (if applicable) after measurement of the value of our common stock in connection with the following valuation measurement dates during the term of the success payment agreement: (1) December 19, 2014 (the date our common stock first became publicly traded upon our initial public offering); (2) the date on which we sell, lease, transfer, or exclusively license all or substantially all of our assets to another company; (3) the date on which we merge or consolidate with or into another entity (other than a merger in 
-31-

which our pre-merger stockholders own a majority of the shares of the surviving entity); (4) any date on which ARCH Venture Fund VII, L.P. or C.L. Alaska L.P. transfers a majority of its shares of company capital stock held by it on such date to a third party; (5) every second anniversary of any event described in the preceding clauses (1), (2), (3) or (4); and (6) the last day of the term of the success payment agreement. Any success payment will generally be made within 90 days after the applicable valuation measurement date, except that (1) in the case of an initial public offering, the payment will be made on March 19, 2016, which the date that is 90 days after the first anniversary of the date our common stock first became publicly traded upon our initial public offering, and (2) in the case of a merger or sale of all of our company’s assets, the success payment will be made on the earlier of the 90th day following the transaction or the first date that transaction proceeds are paid to any of our stockholders. In the case of an initial public offering, the value of our common stock for determining whether a success payment was owed was determined by the average closing price of a share of our common stock over the consecutive 90 calendar day period preceding December 19, 2015, which was the first anniversary of the date our common stock first became publicly traded following our initial public offering. In the case of a valuation measurement date triggered by each second anniversary of our stock first becoming publicly traded, the value of our common stock for determining whether a success payment is owed will be determined by the average closing price of a share of our common stock over the consecutive 90 calendar day period preceding such anniversary date, so long as our common stock is publicly tradable during such 90 calendar day period. On all other valuation measurement dates (if any), the value will be determined either, in the case of a merger or stock sale, by the consideration paid in the transaction for each share of our stock or, in all other cases, by a baseball arbitration process. The amount of a success payment is determined based on whether the value of our common stock meets or exceeds certain specified threshold values ascending from $40.00 per share to $120.00 per share, in each case subject to adjustment for any stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, or other similar events. Each threshold is associated with a success payment, ascending from $10.0 million at $40.00 per share to $150.0 million at $120.00 per share, payable if such threshold is reached. Any previous success payments made to MSK are credited against the success payment owed as of any valuation measurement date, so that MSK does not receive multiple success payments in connection with the same threshold. The success payments paid to MSK will not exceed, in aggregate, $150.0 million, which would be owed only when the value of the common stock reaches $120.00 per share. In October 2015, we entered into an agreement with MSK to provide that certain indirect costs related to certain clinical studies and research projects are creditable against any success payments, and we amended this agreement in December 2015. If we elect to make a success payment in shares of our common stock, the number of shares to be issued is computed by dividing the dollar amount of the success payment by the volume weighted average trading price of a share of our common stock on the trading day preceding the date on which the success payment is made.
In December 2015, a success payment to MSK was triggered in the amount of $10.0 million, which we elected to pay, less indirect cost offsets of $1.0 million, in the form of 240,381 shares of our common stock in March 2016. In April 2016, we agreed to repurchase the 240,381 shares of common stock issued to MSK at a repurchase price of $41.90 per share.
The completion of the Offer would trigger a success payment valuation measurement date, and a success payment of $70 million, less indirect cost offsets, would be owed to MSK.
Seattle Children’s Research Institute License and Collaboration Agreement
In February 2014, we entered into a license agreement with SCRI that grants to us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing sublicensable license to certain patent rights to develop, make, and commercialize licensed products and to perform licensed services for all therapeutic, prophylactic, and diagnostic uses. The patents and patent applications covered by this agreement are directed, in part, to regulated transgene expression and CAR constructs, including bispecific CARs and customized spacer regions, and their use for immunotherapy. Pursuant to this license agreement, as of December 31, 2017, we have rights to one issued U.S. patent, eight pending U.S. patent applications, and a number of other pending patent applications in jurisdictions outside the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid SCRI an upfront payment of $200,000 and are required to pay to SCRI annual license maintenance fees, creditable against royalties and milestone payments due to SCH, of $50,000 per year for the first five years and $200,000 per year thereafter. Pursuant to the license agreement, we are obligated to pay to SCRI low single-digit royalties based on annual net sales of licensed products and licensed services by us and our affiliates and sublicensees. Based on the progress we make in the advancement of licensed products, including JCAR014 and JCAR017, we may be required to make clinical and regulatory milestone payments totaling up to $13.3 million in the aggregate per licensed product and up to $3.0 million in commercial milestone payments. In addition, we are required to pay to SCRI a percentage of the payments that we receive from sublicensees of certain rights licensed to us by SCRI, up to an aggregate of $15.0 million, which percentage will be based upon the date we receive such payments and the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones. The term of the license agreement will continue until the expiration or abandonment of all licensed patents and patent applications. We have the right to terminate the agreement at will upon 60 days’ written notice to SCRI. SCRI may terminate the agreement upon 90 days’ notice in the event of our uncured material breach, or upon 30 days’ notice if such breach is of a payment obligation. SCRI may terminate the agreement immediately if we challenge the enforceability, validity, 
-32-

or scope of any licensed patent right or assist a third party to do so. The agreement will terminate immediately in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency.
Also in February 2014, we entered into a sponsored research agreement with SCRI. The research is conducted under project orders containing plans and budgets approved by the parties. We have an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license to certain improvements, inventions, and other intellectual property rights owned by SCRI developed in connection with the work conducted under the sponsored research agreement. In some circumstances, we may be required to pay an option exercise fee to SCRI of up to $100,000 per improvement. When improvements provide substantial new functionality or commercial benefit and can be practiced without a license to any of the patents already licensed under the license agreement, we may agree to additional royalties, development milestones, and diligence obligations. The initial term of the sponsored research agreement was five years, and has since been extended through April 2020. SCRI may terminate the agreement for any reason upon 180 days’ notice, or immediately if the principal investigator is unable to continue performing the research and there is no successor acceptable to both parties. Either party may terminate the agreement upon 30 days’ notice in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach.
City of Hope License Agreement
In November 2009, ZetaRx LLC ("ZetaRx") entered into a license agreement with City of Hope ("COH") pursuant to which ZetaRx was granted an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license under certain patent rights to manufacture and commercialize products involving genetically engineered white blood cells for the treatment or prevention of disease in humans. The agreement was amended in May 2016 to update the patent exhibits to the agreement. The patents and patent applications covered by this agreement are directed, in part, to CAR constructs, including bispecific CARs and T cell ablation technologies, and their use for immunotherapy. Pursuant to this license agreement, as of December 31, 2017, we have rights to 13 issued U.S. patents, three pending U.S. patent applications, and a number of other patents and patent applications in jurisdictions outside the United States. The license is sublicensable with consent, and our sublicensees cannot grant further sublicenses. This license agreement was assumed by us in connection with our acquisition of certain of ZetaRx’s assets in October 2013. Under the terms of the license agreement, we are required to pay COH an annual license maintenance fee of $25,000, which payment is creditable against any other royalties due for the applicable year. In addition, the license agreement requires us to pay COH low single-digit royalties on annual net sales by us and our sublicensees. In addition, we are required to pay COH a fixed percentage of certain payments we receive from sublicensees of the technology licensed to us by COH.
The license agreement shall expire, on a country-by-country basis, upon the expiration of the last to expire of the patent rights licensed to us in such country. The agreement may be terminated by either party upon 30 days’ prior written notice in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach. In addition, COH may terminate the agreement immediately upon written notice in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of our company, or if we do not reach certain clinical milestones by certain dates.
We and COH are involved in litigation regarding this license agreement. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital Agreement; Sublicense to Penn and Novartis
In December 2013, we entered into an agreement with St. Jude (the "St. Jude License Agreement") pursuant to which we (1) obtained control over, and are obliged to pursue and defend, St. Jude’s causes of action in a pending litigation in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania v. St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Civil Action No. 2:13-cv-01502-SD (the "Penn litigation"), in which we and St. Jude were each adverse to Penn and Novartis, and (2) acquired an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license under certain patent rights owned by St. Jude, including the ’645 Patent, to develop, make, and commercialize licensed products and services for all therapeutic, diagnostic, preventative, and palliative uses. The patents and patent applications covered by this agreement are directed, in part, to CAR constructs capable of signaling both a primary and a co-stimulatory pathway. Pursuant to the St. Jude License Agreement, as of December 31, 2017, we have rights to three issued U.S. patents and three pending U.S. patent applications. The Penn litigation concerned both the ’645 Patent and a contractual dispute between St. Jude and Penn. We also obtained settlement authority in the Penn litigation, subject to certain conditions.
Upon entering into this the St. Jude License Agreement, we made an initial payment to St. Jude of $25.0 million. In addition, the agreement requires us to pay St. Jude low single-digit royalties on net sales of licensed products and services. We are also obligated to pay a $100,000 minimum annual royalty for the first two years of the agreement, and a $500,000 minimum royalty thereafter through the term of the agreement. In addition, we are required to make milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $62.5 million upon the achievement of specified clinical, regulatory, and commercialization milestones for licensed products, which includes JCAR014 and JCAR017. In addition, we are required to pay St. Jude a percentage of certain payments we 
-33-

receive from sublicensees of the rights licensed to us by St. Jude or in settlement of litigation with respect to such rights. We were also required to pay a percentage of St. Jude’s reasonable legal fees incurred in connection with the Penn litigation.
The term of the St. Jude License Agreement will expire, on a country-by-country basis, upon the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents and patent applications in such country. The agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency, or upon advance written notice in the event of the other party’s uncured breach. We may terminate the agreement at will, in its entirety or with respect to any particular licensed patent or patent application, upon advance written notice to St. Jude.
In April 2015, St. Jude and we agreed to settle the litigation with Penn and Novartis. In connection with such settlement, we entered into a sublicense agreement (the "Penn/Novartis Sublicense Agreement") with Penn and an affiliate of Novartis pursuant to which Juno granted to Novartis a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing sublicense under certain patent rights, including the ‘645 Patent, to develop, make and commercialize licensed products and licensed services for all therapeutic, diagnostic, preventative and palliative uses. This sublicense is not sublicensable without our prior written consent, although Novartis may authorize third parties to act on its behalf with respect to the manufacture, development or commercialization of Novartis’ licensed products and licensed services. Pursuant to the Penn/Novartis Sublicense Agreement, Novartis paid Juno $12.3 million upon the effectiveness of such agreement, which amount was first applied to cover certain predetermined litigation expenses incurred by St. Jude, with the remainder divided between Juno and St. Jude at a fixed ratio. In addition, Novartis is also required to pay mid-single digit royalties on the U.S. net sales of products and services related to the disputed contract and patent claims (the "Novartis Royalty Payments"), a low double digit percentage of the royalties Novartis pays to Penn for global net sales of those products (the "Penn Royalty Payments"), and milestone payments upon the achievement of specified clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestones for licensed products (the "Novartis Milestone Payments"). If Juno achieves any of the milestones prior to Novartis, the related Novartis Milestone Payment will be reduced by 50%. In addition, if Juno achieves any milestone after Novartis, Juno will reimburse Novartis 50% of any Novartis Milestone Payment previously paid by Novartis to Juno in respect of such milestone. These milestones largely overlap with the milestones for which Juno may owe a payment to St. Jude under the St. Jude License Agreement and the Novartis Milestone Payments would in effect serve to partially offset Juno’s obligations to St. Jude with respect to such milestones.
The term of the Penn/Novartis Sublicense Agreement will expire when there are no remaining payment obligations due under the agreement. The Penn/Novartis Sublicense Agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency or upon the occurrence of certain specified breaches, or upon advance written notice in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach. Novartis may terminate the Penn/Novartis Sublicense Agreement at will upon advance written notice to Juno.
In connection with the settlement, Juno also amended the St. Jude License Agreement to provide the terms by which the Penn/Novartis Sublicense Agreement would be treated under the St. Jude License Agreement. The net effect of the Penn/Novartis Sublicense Agreement and amendment to the St. Jude License Agreement is that (1) Juno will pass through a percentage of the Novartis Royalty Payments to St. Jude, and (2) Juno will pass through a portion of the Penn Royalty Payments and Novartis Milestone Payments to St. Jude.
In 2016, Novartis paid us an aggregate of $14.3 million upon the achievement of two clinical milestones by Novartis, $12.5 million of which we were required to pass on to St. Jude. We separately achieved the same clinical milestones in September 2017, as a result of which we were required to reimburse Novartis $7.1 million.
In August 2017, a regulatory milestone was met under both the Penn/Novartis Sublicense Agreement and the St. Jude License Agreement, pursuant to which the Company recognized milestone revenue of $25.0 million from Novartis, and a corresponding research and development expense to St. Jude of $6.8 million. In the event we separately achieve the same clinical milestone in the future, we will be required to reimburse Novartis $12.5 million.
License Agreements with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center assumed from ZetaRx
We assumed two license agreements with FHCRC in connection with our acquisition of certain of ZetaRx’s assets in October 2013. ZetaRx entered into these license agreements with FHCRC in 2009 (the "2009 FHCRC Agreement") and 2012 (the "2012 FHCRC Agreement"). These agreements were amended and restated in November 2014, and the 2012 FHCRC Agreement was further amended in October 2015 to add additional patent assets to the scope of the license. Under each of these license agreements, we received an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under patent and technology rights to make, manufacture, use, and commercialize products (and, under the 2009 FHCRC Agreement only, services) for all fields of use. The patents and patent applications covered by these agreements are directed, in part, to defined T cell compositions and their use for immunotherapy. Pursuant to these license agreements, as of December 31, 2017, we have rights to one issued U.S. patent, four pending U.S. patent applications, approximately eight issued patents in jurisdictions outside the United States, and a 
-34-

number of other patent applications in jurisdictions outside the United States. Pursuant to each of the agreements, we are required to pay FHCRC a low single-digit running royalty based on annual net sales of licensed products (and, under the 2009 FHCRC Agreement only, licensed services) by us and by our affiliates and sublicensees. In addition, under each agreement, we are required to pay to FHCRC a minimum annual royalty of $5,000 until we receive FDA approval of a licensed product, and a minimum annual royalty of $20,000 thereafter for the remainder of the applicable agreement term, which payments will be creditable against any running royalties due to FHCRC under the respective license agreements. Under the 2012 FHCRC Agreement, we are required to pay to FHCRC up to an aggregate of $1.4 million upon our achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones relating to the licensed products, which includes JCAR014 and JCAR017. In addition, under each of the license agreements, we are required to pay FHCRC a fixed percentage of certain payments that we receive from sublicensees of the rights licensed to us by FHCRC, up to a cap.
Unless earlier terminated, each of these license agreements will expire upon the expiration of the last to expire of the patent rights licensed to us under the respective agreements. Each agreement may be terminated by FHCRC upon 90 days’ written notice if we fail to provide satisfactory written evidence that we have submitted an IND application to the FDA, by June 2015 in the case of the 2009 FHCRC Agreement, and by January 2017 in the case of the 2012 FHCRC Agreement. We have the right to terminate each of the agreements at will, in part or in their entirety, upon 60 days’ written notice to FHCRC. Each of the license agreements may also be terminated by FHCRC in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency, upon 90 days’ written notice in the event of our uncured material breach, and upon 30 days’ written notice in the event of our uncured breach of a payment or reporting obligation. Upon termination, but not expiration, of either of these license agreements, we must grant to FHCRC a royalty-bearing, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license with respect to any improvements we make based on the patents or technology licensed to us under the respective agreements.
Royalty and Milestone Obligations for JCAR017
Under our existing license agreements, our overall royalty burden for net sales of JCAR017 in the United States is approximately 10%. As of the date of this report, based on our planned manufacturing process for JCAR017, the aggregate maximum amount of future milestone payments we could be required to make under our existing license and collaboration agreements is approximately $95 million for JCAR017. Certain milestones would be paid in euros, which have been estimated in U.S. dollars for the foregoing figures based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2017.
Opus Bio License Agreement
In December 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Opus Bio pursuant to which we were granted an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain patent rights and data to research, develop, make, have made, use, have used, sell, have sold, offer to sell, import and otherwise exploit products that incorporate or use engineered T cells directed against CD22 and that are covered by such patent rights or use or incorporate such data. Certain of the licensed patent rights are in-licensed by Opus Bio from the National Institutes of Health ("NIH"). The patents and patent applications covered by this agreement are directed, in part, to various human monoclonal antibodies specific for CD22 and their use in immunotherapy. Pursuant to this license agreement, as of December 31, 2017, we have rights to six issued U.S. patents, three pending U.S. patent applications, and a number of other patents and patent applications in jurisdictions outside the United States. The licensed data was generated under an agreement between Opus Bio and the National Cancer Institute ("NCI") and Opus Bio’s rights to the licensed data are not exclusive. Our rights to such data are therefore exclusive only as between us and Opus, and non-exclusive as between us and third parties, who may license such data from the NCI. Our license from Opus Bio is limited to the field of treating B cell malignancies that express CD22 on their cell surface using CARs containing certain specified antibody binding fragments. Under the agreement, we will be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop, and commercialize licensed products. Such development must be in accordance with the timelines provided in the license agreement for achievement of certain clinical, regulatory, and commercial benchmarks, and with the development plans set forth in Opus Bio’s agreements with the NIH. In November 2015, the license agreement was amended to adjust certain of these timelines.
Upon the effectiveness of this license in December 2014, we made an upfront payment to Opus Bio of $20.0 million in cash and issued to Opus Bio 1,602,564 shares of our common stock. Upon our achievement of certain clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones set forth in the license agreement, we will be obligated to pay Opus Bio additional consideration. The consideration due upon achievement of the first three clinical milestones would consist of additional shares of our common stock in an amount equal to the dollar value specified for the applicable milestone, divided by the greater of $10.92 and the arithmetic average of the daily volume-weighted average price of our common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market over the 30 trading days preceding the achievement of the milestone, up to a maximum of 4,807,692 shares in the aggregate (this minimum per share value and maximum number of shares subject, in each case, to adjustment for any stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, or other similar events). Two of these milestones were achieved in the first quarter of 2016, for which we issued a total of 603,364 shares of our common stock as payment. After giving effect to the achievement of these 
-35-

milestones, as of December 31, 2016, one milestone required to be paid in equity in the amount of $25.0 million remains to be achieved, along with up to $215.0 million in milestones payable in cash. The license agreement further provides that we are required to pay to Opus Bio tiered royalties based on annual net sales of licensed products by us and by our sublicensees, at rates ranging from the low-single to mid-single digits. We will also be required to make certain pass-through payments owed by Opus Bio to NIH under its NIH license agreements, including certain patent costs, development and commercial milestones of up to $2.8 million in the aggregate, and low single-digit royalties based on annual net sales.
Our obligations to pay royalties to Opus Bio will expire, on a country-by-country and licensed-product- by-licensed-product basis, upon the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering such product in such country and the expiration of the period of data protection or market exclusivity or similar protection granted by the regulatory authority in such country for such product. The license agreement will expire on the expiration of our payment obligations to Opus Bio and to the NIH. We may terminate the agreement at will upon 30 days’ prior written notice. Opus Bio has the right to terminate the agreement immediately in the event of our material breach, including our failure to meet certain regulatory, clinical, and commercial deadlines, that remains uncured after a period of notice from Opus Bio, and immediately upon notice in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency. If we terminate for convenience, or if Opus Bio terminates due to our material breach, then we will be subject to obligations allowing Opus Bio to continue to develop licensed products, including transfer of certain materials and products, transfer of ownership of certain regulatory documents and any approved trademarks or brand names, the assignment of third-party agreements solely related to the licensed products and necessary for the research, development, or commercialization of the licensed products, our continued manufacture of the licensed products, and the grant of certain non-exclusive licenses under certain technology controlled by us. If we terminate the license agreement for convenience and Opus elects to continue to develop the licensed products, then we have the option to resume our rights under the license agreement in exchange for additional payment obligations to Opus.
Other Licenses and Third-Party Collaboration Agreements
We have entered into a number of other license agreements and collaboration agreements with third parties, including additional license agreements with MSK, FHCRC, and SCRI, in connection with our preclinical and clinical research and development activities. These include, among others:

• | A collaboration and license agreement with Fate to identify and utilize small molecules to modulate our genetically-engineered T cell product candidates to improve their therapeutic potential for cancer patients.


• | A collaboration and license agreement with Editas to pursue research programs utilizing Editas’ genome editing technologies with Juno’s CAR and TCR technologies.


• | A clinical study collaboration agreement with MedImmune to conduct combination clinical trials in immuno-oncology with one of our investigational CD19-directed CAR product candidates and MedImmune’s investigational PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab.


• | We and WuXi AppTec formed a company, JW (Cayman) Therapeutics Co., Ltd ("JW Cayman"), to leverage Juno’s CAR and TCR technologies and WuXi AppTec’s research and development and manufacturing platform and local expertise to develop novel cell-based immunotherapies for patients in China with hematologic and solid organ cancers. In December 2017, Juno entered into a license and strategic alliance agreement with JW Cayman and its affiliates (the "JW License and Strategic Alliance Agreement"). Under the agreement, JW Cayman received an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize a therapeutic product candidate in China, as well as the right of first negotiation to license Juno's future pipeline candidates for further development in China.


• | A license agreement with MSK and Eureka Therapeutics, Inc. pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive license pertaining to a fully-human binding domain targeting BCMA, as well as binding domains against two additional undisclosed multiple myeloma targets to be used for the potential development and commercialization of CAR cell therapies for patients with multiple myeloma.


• | License agreements with Eli Lilly and Company, OncoTracker, Inc., and FHCRC, to advance Juno's program in multiple myeloma using GSIs in combination with BCMA-directed CAR T cells. Gamma secretase is an enzyme that cleaves a set of transmembrane proteins, including BCMA. Multiple publications have shown that treatment with GSIs can increase surface expression of BCMA on tumors, particularly multiple myeloma. Increased cell surface BCMA may increase potency of a BCMA-directed CAR T therapy.

Acquisitions
During 2015 and 2016, we completed four business acquisitions to augment our research and development capabilities, to obtain access to a compound that could potentially be used in combination trials, and to improve our supply chain and long-term cost of goods.
Stage Cell Therapeutics
In May 2015, we acquired Stage, a company focused on developing technology platforms, including novel reagents and automation technologies, that enable the development and production of cell therapeutics. The acquisition of Stage is intended to provide us access to transformative cell selection and activation capabilities, next generation manufacturing automation technologies, enhanced control of our supply chain, and lower expected long-term cost of goods.
As consideration for the Stage acquisition, we paid €52.5 million in cash and issued an aggregate of 486,279 shares of common stock to the selling shareholders. We also agreed to pay additional amounts of up to an aggregate of €135.0 million in cash based on the achievement of certain technical, clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones related to novel reagents (€40.0 million), advanced automation technology (€65.0 million), and Stage’s existing clinical pipeline (€30.0 million). As of December 31, 2017, we have triggered and paid €6.0 million in such milestone payments.
X-Body
In June 2015, we acquired X-Body, a company focused on the discovery of human monoclonal antibodies and discovery of TCR binding domains. 
As consideration for the X-Body acquisition, we paid $21.3 million in cash and issued an aggregate of 366,434 shares of common stock to the former X-Body stockholders. We also agreed to pay additional amounts in cash upon the realization of specified milestones substantially as follows, with respect to products generated using the X-Body technology: $5.0 million per target upon the achievement, during a specified period, of a certain regulatory milestone for products that utilize a certain type of binding mechanism; up to $30.0 million upon the achievement, during a specified period, of regulatory and clinical milestones for the first product using another type of binding mechanism (any product using such type of binding mechanism, a "Type X Product"); $5.0 million per product upon the achievement, during a specified period, of a certain regulatory milestone for a certain number of subsequent Type X Products; $50.0 million upon the achievement, during a specified period, of a clinical milestone related to the first product with certain specified binding properties (a "Type Y Product"); and $20.0 million upon the achievement, during a specified period, of a clinical milestone related to the first product with certain other specified binding properties. If a Type X Product or a Type Y Product is commercialized, we can choose either to make a commercialization milestone payment for such a product or to pay a low single-digit royalty on net sales of such a product.
AbVitro
In January 2016, we acquired AbVitro, a company with a leading next-generation single cell sequencing platform. The AbVitro acquisition is intended to augment our capabilities to create best-in-class engineered T cells against a broad array of cancer targets. We will initially use this technology in our translation research assays, to find and generate fully-human TCRs and antibodies, and to find novel targets.
As consideration for the AbVitro acquisition, we paid $74.7 million in cash and issued 1,289,188 shares of our common stock. There are no milestone payment obligations under the terms of the AbVitro acquisition.
We and Celgene have agreed in principle to enter into an agreement to license Celgene a subset of the acquired AbVitro technology and to grant Celgene options to certain related potential product rights emanating from the acquired technology.
RedoxTherapies
In July 2016, we acquired RedoxTherapies. The acquisition provides us with an exclusive license to vipadenant, a small molecule A2a receptor antagonist that has the potential to disrupt important immunosuppressive pathways in the tumor microenvironment in certain cancers. As consideration for the acquisition, we paid $10.0 million in cash and agreed to deliver additional consideration upon achievement of specified clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones.

Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including the gene therapy field, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We face substantial competition from many different sources, including large biopharmaceutical companies, midsize/smaller public and privately-held biotechnology firms, academic research institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions.
In addition to the current standard of care treatments for patients, a large number of commercial and academic clinical trials are being pursued by variety of parties in the field of immunotherapy. Early positive clinical results from these trials have fueled continued interest in the field of immunotherapy. In the CAR and TCR space, our competitors include, but are not limited to, Novartis / Penn, Kite / Gilead Sciences, Inc. ("Gilead") / Amgen / NCI, Cellectis / Pfizer / Servier, Johnson & Johnson / Transposagen Biopharmaceuticals / Legend Biotech, Poseida, bluebird bio, Bellicum, Celyad, NantKwest, Intrexon / ZIOPHARM / MD Anderson Cancer Center, Unum Therapeutics, Adaptimmune / GlaxoSmithKline, ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, Adicet Bio, Autolus, and Mustang Bio, Inc. In August 2017, Novartis received approval from the FDA for Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel), formerly known as CTL019, for the treatment of pediatric and young adult r/r ALL. Additionally, in October 2017, Kite received approval from the FDA for Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), formerly known as KTE-C19, for treatment of patients with r/r NHL. Kite has been acquired by Gilead.
We also face competition from non-cell based treatments offered by companies such as Amgen, Pfizer, Abbvie, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers, Incyte, Merck, Roche, Regeneron, Corvus, MacroGenics, and Johnson & Johnson. 
Many of our larger current or potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have greater financial resources and deeper expertise in manufacturing, preclinical testing, clinical trial execution, regulatory matters and commercializing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and gene therapy industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of very capable competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining experienced scientific and management personnel, patient enrollment for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs’ success.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that alone or in combination have better efficacy, less toxicity, more convenience, or are less expensive than the products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do, which may also include broader labels, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety, and convenience, along with our ability to simply operationalize the use of our products.
Government Regulation
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices ("GLP") regulation;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;


• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board ("IRB") or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;

-38-


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigations to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices ("GCP"); and


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
In addition to the IND submission process, sponsors of certain clinical studies of cells containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, including human gene transfer studies, must comply with the National Institutes of Health’s ("NIH") Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules ("NIH Guidelines"). The NIH Guidelines set forth the principles and requirements for NIH and institutional oversight of research with recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, including the standards for investigators and institutions to follow to ensure the safe handling and containment of such molecules. In April 2016, modifications to the NIH Guidelines went into effect, pursuant to which only a subset of human gene transfer protocols are subject to review by the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee ("RAC"), a federal advisory committee that provides recommendations regarding research involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules. Specifically, under the modified NIH Guidelines, RAC review of the protocol will be required only in exceptional cases where (1) an oversight body such as an Institutional Biosafety Committee ("IBC"), which provides local review and oversight of research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, or an IRB determines that the protocol would significantly benefit from RAC review, and (2) the protocol (a) uses a new vector, genetic material, or delivery methodology that represents a first-in-human experience and thus presents an unknown risk, and/or (b) relies on preclinical safety data that were obtained using a new preclinical model system of unknown and unconfirmed value, and/or (c) involves a proposed vector, gene construct, or method of delivery associated with possible toxicities that are not widely known and that may render it difficult for oversight bodies to evaluate the protocol rigorously. The RAC review proceedings are public, and reports are posted publicly to the website for the NIH’s Office of Biotechnology Activities. Although compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for research conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. Independent of RAC review, the NIH Guidelines also require all human gene transfer protocols subject to the NIH Guidelines to be registered with NIH, with limited exemptions. A study subject to the NIH Guidelines may not begin until the IBC approves the protocol, and the IBC cannot approve the protocol until confirmation from the NIH that such registration is complete. In the event that RAC review is warranted, the protocol registration process cannot be completed until RAC review has taken place. 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial 
-39-

must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.

• | Phase I—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.


• | Phase II—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase II clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase III clinical trials.


• | Phase III—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.


• | Phase IV—In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so- called Phase IV studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA.

Phase I, Phase II and Phase III testing may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
BLA Submission and Review by the FDA
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial User Fee to FDA, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority Review designation will direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of applications for products that, if approved, would be significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an 
-40-

advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response Letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response Letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS") to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase IV post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act was signed into law. The Act is intended, among other things, to modernize the regulation of drugs and biologics and to spur innovation.
A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA’s review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. For a fast track product, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if relevant criteria are met. A fast track designated product candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA sets the target date for FDA action on the BLA at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted when there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious disease or condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the biologic’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act ("FDASIA"), which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established the breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Sponsors may request that FDA designate a product candidate as a breakthrough 
-41-

therapy at the time of or any time after the submission of an IND, but ideally before an end-of-phase II meeting with FDA. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller trials or more efficient trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. Breakthrough therapy designation comes with all of the benefits of fast track designation, which means that the sponsor may file sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis if certain conditions are satisfied, including an agreement with FDA on the proposed schedule for submission of portions of the application and the payment of applicable user fees before the FDA may initiate a review. We plan to seek designation as a breakthrough therapy for some or all of our CD19 product candidates, as qualification permits. We have obtained breakthrough therapy designation for JCAR017 for the treatment of patients with r/r aggressive large B cell NHL, including DLBCL, not otherwise specified (de novo or transformed from indolent lymphoma), primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), or follicular lymphoma grade 3B.
Fast Track designation, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee.
A designated orphan drug many not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if the second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. We plan to seek orphan drug designation for some or all of our CD19 product candidates in specific orphan indications in which there is a medically plausible basis for the use of these products. We have obtained orphan drug designation for JCAR017 in DLBCL, CLL, ALL, and follicular lymphoma, and for JCARH125 for the treatment of multiple myeloma.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and 
-42-

documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may, among other things, halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the BLA.
We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates, and expect to rely in the future on third parties for the production of commercial quantities. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the "Affordable Care Act"), signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 ("BPCIA"), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. To date, only a handful of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, although numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.
Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or 
-43-

switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant's own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed "interchangeable" by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued "Written Request" for such a study.
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Our sales, promotion, medical education and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to FDA, including potentially the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services and state and local governments. Our promotional and scientific/educational programs must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the False Claims Act, the Veterans Health Care Act, physician payment transparency laws, privacy laws, security laws, and additional state laws similar to the foregoing.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, the offer, receipt, or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients or the use of products or services that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. The government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham research or consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as private payors.
The False Claims Act ("FCA"), imposes liability on persons who, among other things, present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal health care program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multibillion dollar settlements under the FCA in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition, companies have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans, and have often become subject to consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements, restricting the manner in which they conduct their business. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will

continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments or other transfers of value made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices, require reporting of marketing expenditures and pricing information and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and other healthcare professionals.
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH"), and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's privacy and security standards directly applicable to "business associates," defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
Also, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, future distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers, integrated delivery networks, and other organizations. Although we currently believe that third-party payors will provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our products. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Moreover, a payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
Healthcare Reform
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.

By way of example, the Affordable Care Act signed into law in 2010 was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to our potential drug candidates are:

• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;


• | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;


• | extension of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.

Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. We expect that the current presidential administration and U.S. Congress will likely continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. Most recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. The impact that President Trump’s administration and the U.S. Congress may have, if any, is uncertain, and any changes will likely take time to unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Affordable Care Act.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, the 21st Century Cures Act changes the reimbursement methodology for infusion drugs and biologics furnished through durable medical equipment in an attempt to remedy over- and underpayment of certain drugs. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.
We expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, lower reimbursement, new payment methodologies, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments

from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs.
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. 
In the EU, member states require both regulatory clearances by the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical trial. 
Under the EU regulatory systems, authorization to market a product in the member states of the European Union proceeds under one of four procedures: a centralized authorization procedure, a mutual recognition procedure, a decentralized procedure, or a national procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. It is compulsory for medicines that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions; viral disease; for advanced therapy medicinal products; for products officially designated orphan medicines and; for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes (i.e., recombinant DNA technology, controlled expression of genes coding for biologically active proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes including transformed mammalian cells, and hybridoma and monoclonal antibody methods). Because our products are produced by one of those biotechnological processes, we would be subject to the centralized process. 
Under the centralized authorization procedure, the EMA's Committee for Human Medicinal Products ("CHMP") serves as the scientific committee that renders opinions about the safety, efficacy and quality of medicinal products for human use on behalf of the EMA. The CHMP is composed of experts nominated by each member state's national authority for medicinal products, one of whom is appointed to act as Rapporteur for the co-ordination of the evaluation with the possible assistance of another member of the Committee acting as a Co-Rapporteur. After approval, the Rapporteur(s) continue to monitor the product throughout its life cycle. The CHMP has 210 days to adopt an opinion as to whether a marketing authorization should be granted. The process usually takes longer in case additional information is requested, which triggers clock-stops in the procedural timelines. The process is complex and involves extensive consultation with the regulatory authorities of member states and a number of experts. Once the procedure is completed, a European Public Assessment Report ("EPAR") is produced. If the opinion is negative, information is given as to the grounds on which this conclusion was reached. After the adoption of the CHMP opinion, a decision on the marketing authorization application must be adopted by the European Commission, after consulting the EU Member States, which in total can take more than 60 days.
