Item 1. Business
Founded in 1889, CB&I, a Netherlands company, provides a wide range of services, including conceptual design, technology, engineering, procurement, fabrication, modularization, construction and commissioning services to customers in the energy infrastructure market throughout the world. Our stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “CBI.” With more than a century of experience and approximately 26,400 employees worldwide, we capitalize on our global expertise and local knowledge to safely and reliably deliver projects virtually anywhere. At a given point in time, we have active projects in process in more than 70 countries.
Our business is aligned into three operating groups, which represent our reportable segments: Engineering & Construction; Fabrication Services; and Technology. See below and Note 5 within Item 8 for further discussion of our discontinued operations and below and Note 19 within Item 8 for further discussion of our reportable segments and related financial information.
Business Combination
On December 18, 2017, we entered into an agreement (the “Combination Agreement”) to combine with McDermott International, Inc. (“McDermott”) in an all-stock transaction whereby McDermott stockholders will own approximately 53% of the combined company and our shareholders will own approximately 47% (the “Combination”). Under the terms of the Combination Agreement, our shareholders would be entitled to receive 2.47221 shares of McDermott common stock for each share of our common stock (or 0.82407 shares if McDermott effects a planned three-to-one reverse stock split prior to closing), together with cash in lieu of fractional shares and subject to any applicable withholding taxes. The Combination is anticipated to close in the second quarter 2018, subject to the approval of our shareholders and McDermott stockholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
Dispositions
Capital Services Operations—On February 27, 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement (the “CS Agreement”) with CSVC Acquisition Corp (“CSVC”), under which CSVC agreed to acquire our “Capital Services Operations” (primarily comprised of our former Capital Services reportable segment). Our Capital Services Operations provided comprehensive and integrated maintenance services, environmental engineering and remediation, construction services, program management, and disaster response and recovery services for private-sector customers and governments. We completed the sale on June 30, 2017 (the “Closing Date”), and during 2017 we received net proceeds of approximately $599.0 million (approximately $645.5 million net of cash sold and including $46.5 million for transaction costs and estimated working capital and other adjustments required by the CS agreement). As a result of the aforementioned, during 2017, we recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $64.8 million, and income tax expense of approximately $51.6 million resulting from a taxable gain on the transaction (due primarily to the non-deductibility of goodwill). The transaction did not result in any material cash taxes associated with the taxable gain due to the use of previously recorded net operating loss carryforwards. The proceeds received were used to reduce our outstanding debt. See Note 5 within Item 8 for further discussion of the sale of our Capital Services Operations. 
Nuclear Operations—On December 31, 2015, we completed the sale of our nuclear power construction business (our “Nuclear Operations”), previously included within our Engineering & Construction operating group, to Westinghouse Electric Company LLC (“WEC”) for transaction consideration of approximately $161.0 million, which was to be due upon WEC’s substantial completion of the acquired VC Summer and Vogtle nuclear projects. At December 31, 2015, we recorded the present value of the transaction consideration (the “Transaction Receivable”); however, during the fourth quarter 2016 we determined that recovery was no longer probable and recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of approximately $148.1 million (approximately $96.3 million after-tax) to reserve the Transaction Receivable. During 2015, we also recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of approximately $1.5 billion (approximately $1.1 billion after-tax) related to the impairment of goodwill (approximately $453.1 million) and intangible assets (approximately $79.1 million) and a loss on the net assets sold (approximately $973.7 million) as a result of the sale. See Note 4 and Note 14 within Item 8 for further discussion of the sale of our Nuclear Operations and related dispute with WEC, respectively. 
Discontinued Operations
Capital Services Operations—We considered the aforementioned Capital Services Operations to be a discontinued operation in the first quarter 2017, as the divestiture represented a strategic shift and will have a material effect on our operations and financial results. Our classification of the Capital Services Operations as a discontinued operation requires retrospective application to financial information for all periods presented. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, the values presented throughout this report have been updated to reflect our continuing operations. See below and Note 5 within Item 8 for further discussion of our discontinued Capital Services Operations. 
5

Technology Operations—In July 2017, we initiated a plan to market and sell our “Technology Operations” (primarily comprised of our Technology reportable segment and our “Engineered Products Operations”, representing a portion of our Fabrication Services reportable segment). We considered the Technology Operations to be a discontinued operation in the third quarter 2017, as the anticipated divestiture represented a strategic shift and would have a material effect on our operations and financial results. However, during the fourth quarter 2017, we suspended our plan to sell our Technology Operations due to the Combination Agreement. As such, the Technology Operations are not reported as a discontinued operation at December 31, 2017 or for any periods presented.

Competitive Strengths
Our core competencies, which we believe are significant competitive strengths, include:
Strong Health, Safety and Environmental (“HSE”) Performance. Because of our long and outstanding safety record, we are sometimes invited to bid on projects for which other competitors do not qualify. Our HSE performance also translates directly to lower costs and reduced risk to our employees, subcontractors and customers. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national Lost Workday Case Incidence Rate for construction companies similar to CB&I was 0.6 per 100 full-time employees for 2016 (the latest reported year), while our rates for 2016 and 2017 were only 0.02 per 100 employees and 0.01 per 100 employees, respectively. CB&I was awarded the 2015 Green Cross for Safety medal by the National Safety Council for our outstanding achievement in workplace safety. CB&I was the first company in our industry to earn this honor, which is one of the most prestigious safety awards a company can receive.
Licensed Technologies. We hold approximately 3,200 patents and offer a broad, state-of-the-art portfolio of over 100 hydrocarbon refining, petrochemical and gas processing technologies. Our ability to provide licensed technologies sets us apart from our competitors and presents opportunities for increased profitability. Combining technology with EPC capabilities

strengthens our presence throughout the project life cycle, allowing us to capture additional market share in higher margin growth markets. 
Worldwide Record of Excellence. We have an established record as a leader in the international engineering and construction industry by providing consistently superior project performance for more than a century. The extensive roster of successful projects that we have executed around the world serves as a reference list for prospective clients, many of whom view such reference projects as a critically important element in selecting a contractor. 
Global Execution Capabilities. With a network of approximately 90 sales and operations offices around the world, established supplier relationships and available workforces, we have the ability to rapidly mobilize personnel, materials and equipment to execute projects in locations ranging from highly industrialized countries to some of the world’s most remote regions. Additionally, due primarily to our long-standing presence in numerous markets around the world, we have a prominent position as a local direct hire contractor in global energy and industrial markets.
Integrated Execution Model. We are one of the few EPC contractors that has self-perform construction capability in the U.S. and worldwide. In addition, we believe our world class piping fabrication facilities around the world are unique in the EPC contractor industry. These are key elements of our integrated project delivery model which is designed to provide our customers with lower costs and schedule assurance due to our ability to directly perform and control the critical path activities of most projects. This provides us with a competitive advantage over other EPC contractors that operate in our space.
Modular Fabrication. We are one of the few EPC contractors and process technology providers with fabrication facilities, which allows us to offer customers the option of modular construction, when feasible. In contrast to traditional on-site “stick built” construction, modular construction enables modules to be built within a tightly monitored shop environment which allows us to, among other things, better control quality, minimize weather delays and expedite schedules. Once completed, the modules are shipped to, and assembled at, the project site.
Recognized Expertise. Our in-house engineering team includes internationally-recognized experts in a broad range of energy infrastructure fields, including processes and facilities related to oil and gas production, LNG, refining, petrochemicals, gas processing, power generation, modular design and fabrication, cryogenic storage and processing, and bulk liquid storage and systems. Several of our senior engineers are long-standing members of committees that have helped develop worldwide standards for storage structures and process vessels for the oil and gas industry, including the American Petroleum Institute and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. In addition, and due in part to our integrated execution model, our engineers work closely with project managers to ensure that our design proposals place a premium on practical construction considerations.
Diversified Offering of Products and Services. We are well-diversified in our offerings and in the geographies we serve within the energy infrastructure market. Our diversity ranges from downstream activities such as gas processing, LNG, refining, and petrochemicals, to fossil based power plants and upstream activities such as offshore oil and gas and onshore oil sands projects. Our products and services for these end markets through our continuing operations include feasibility studies and consulting, technology licensing, front end engineering design, EPC, piping and modular fabrication and storage solutions. The diversity of our offerings improves our competitive positioning by allowing us to provide our customers with a fully-integrated platform for turnkey delivery, while retaining the flexibility to provide stand-alone offerings. In addition to serving the energy infrastructure market, we provide diversified government services.
Strong Focus on Project Risk Management. We are experienced in managing the risks associated with identifying, screening, bidding and executing complex projects, and we continually seek to strengthen our risk management processes through the ongoing refinement of our policies and practices. Our position as an integrated EPC service provider allows us to execute global projects on a competitively bid and negotiated basis. We offer our customers a range of contracting options, including cost-reimbursable, fixed-price and hybrid, which has both cost-reimbursable and fixed-price characteristics.
Management Team with Extensive Engineering and Construction Industry Experience. Members of our senior management team have an average of over 25 years of experience in the energy infrastructure industry. 
Growth Strategy
Although our near-term prospects may be moderated by the overall level of capital investment in energy infrastructure, we anticipate that our intermediate-term growth will primarily be derived organically from our competitive positioning in existing end markets. Through our fully integrated offerings, we have the ability to provide technology, engineering, procurement, fabrication, construction, and associated services. Our ability to grow is underpinned by our capacity to compete for, and execute, the largest energy infrastructure projects globally while maintaining the agility to pursue stand-alone opportunities that generate a strong base of work. Our competitive positioning is further supported by our superior record of project execution across the vast majority of our portfolio coupled with selectivity in the developments we pursue and our partnering arrangements.

Competition
We operate in a competitive environment. Technology performance, price, timeliness of completion, quality, safety record, track record and reputation are principal competitive factors within our industry. There are numerous regional, national and global competitors that offer similar services to those offered by each of our operating groups.
Marketing and Customers
We contract directly with hundreds of customers in the energy, petrochemical, natural resource and power industries. We rely primarily on direct contact between our technically qualified sales and engineering staff and our customers’ engineering and contracting departments. Dedicated sales employees are located in offices throughout the world.
Our significant customers are primarily in the hydrocarbon and power generation industries and include major petroleum and petrochemical companies (see the “Segment Financial Information” section above for a representative listing of our customers by operating group). We have longstanding relationships with many of our significant customers; however, we are not dependent upon any single customer on an ongoing basis and do not believe the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our business. 
For 2017, revenue from our LNG export facility project in the U.S. for Freeport LNG, LNG export facility project in the U.S. for Sempra Energy, and ethylene plant project in the U.S. for LACC, LLC was approximately $1.3 billion (approximately 19% of consolidated 2017 revenue), approximately $1.2 billion (approximately 18% of consolidated 2017 revenue), and approximately $721.0 million (approximately 11% of consolidated 2017 revenue), respectively. For 2016, revenue from our LNG export facility project in the U.S. for Sempra Energy, LNG mechanical erection project in the Asia Pacific region for Gorgon LNG, and LNG export facility project in the U.S. for Freeport LNG was approximately $1.6 billion (approximately 19% of consolidated 2016 revenue), approximately $1.1 billion (approximately 13% of consolidated 2016 revenue), and approximately $1.1 billion (approximately 13% of consolidated 2016 revenue), respectively. For 2015, revenue from our LNG mechanical erection and tank projects in the Asia Pacific region for Gorgon LNG and our former Nuclear Operations project in Georgia was approximately $1.6 billion (approximately 15% of consolidated 2015 revenue) and approximately $1.2 billion (approximately 11% of consolidated 2015 revenue), respectively.
Backlog
New awards represent the expected revenue value of new contract commitments received during a given period, as well as scope growth on existing commitments. Backlog represents the unearned value of our new awards. New awards and backlog include the entire award values for joint ventures we consolidate and our proportionate share of award values for joint ventures we proportionately consolidate. New awards and backlog also include our pro-rata share of the award values for unconsolidated joint ventures we account for under the equity method. As the net results for our equity method joint ventures are recognized as equity earnings, their revenue is not presented in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Backlog may fluctuate with currency movements.
At December 31, 2017, we had backlog of approximately $11.4 billion (including approximately $1.2 billion related to our equity method joint ventures), compared with approximately $13.0 billion at December 31, 2016 (including approximately $1.7 billion related to our equity method joint ventures). The decrease in backlog from 2016 is primarily due to the impact of revenue exceeding new awards by $1.4 billion (including approximately $479.1 million of revenue related to our equity method joint ventures) and other adjustments. The geographic mix of our backlog and revenue is primarily dependent upon global energy demand and at December 31, 2017, approximately 30% of our backlog was derived from projects outside the U.S., and for 2017 approximately 20% of our revenue was derived from projects outside the U.S. In addition, as certain contracts within our Engineering & Construction operating group are dependent upon funding from the U.S. government, where funds are appropriated on a year-by-year basis, while contract performance may take more than one year, approximately $355.7 million of our backlog at December 31, 2017 was for contractual commitments that are subject to future funding decisions. Due to the timing of awards and the long-term nature of some of our projects, approximately 40% to 45% of our December 31, 2017 backlog (including backlog associated with our equity method joint ventures) is anticipated to be recognized beyond 2018. See the applicable risk factor in Item 1A “Risk Factors”, and the “Overview” section of Item 7, for further discussion of our backlog.
Types of Contracts
Our contracts are awarded on a competitively bid and negotiated basis using a range of contracting options, including cost-reimbursable, fixed-price and hybrid, which has both cost reimbursable and fixed-price characteristics. Each contract is designed to optimize the balance between risk and reward. At December 31, 2017, approximately 90% of our backlog was contracted on a fixed-price or hybrid basis.

Raw Materials and Suppliers
The principal raw materials we use are metal plate, structural steel, pipe, fittings, catalysts, proprietary equipment and selected engineered equipment such as pressure vessels, exchangers, pumps, valves, compressors, motors and electrical and instrumentation components. Most of these materials are available from numerous suppliers worldwide, with some furnished under negotiated supply agreements. We anticipate being able to obtain these materials for the foreseeable future; however, the price, availability and schedule validities offered by our suppliers may vary significantly from year to year due to various factors, including supplier consolidations, supplier raw material shortages, costs, and surcharges, supplier capacity, customer demand, market conditions, and any duties and tariffs imposed on the materials.
We use subcontractors where it assists us in meeting customer requirements with regard to resources, schedule, cost or technical expertise. These subcontractors may range from small local entities to companies with global capabilities, some of which may be utilized on a repetitive or preferred basis. To the extent necessary, we anticipate being able to locate and contract with qualified subcontractors in all global areas where we do business.
Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to extensive and changing U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as the laws of other countries, that establish health and environmental quality standards. These standards, among others, relate to air and water pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. We are exposed to potential liability for personal injury or property damage caused by any release, spill, exposure or other accident involving such pollutants, substances or wastes.
In connection with the historical operation of our facilities, including those associated with acquired operations, substances which currently are or might be considered hazardous were used or disposed of at some sites that will or may require us to make expenditures for remediation. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify parties from whom we have purchased or to whom we have sold facilities for certain environmental liabilities arising from acts occurring before the dates those facilities were transferred.
We believe we are in compliance, in all material respects, with environmental laws and regulations and maintain insurance coverage to mitigate our exposure to environmental liabilities. We do not believe any environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial position or cash flow. We do not anticipate we will incur material capital expenditures for environmental controls or for the investigation or remediation of environmental conditions during 2018 or 2019.
Patents
We have numerous active patents and patent applications throughout the world, the majority of which are associated with technologies licensed by our Technology operating group. However, no individual patent is so essential that its loss would materially affect our business.
Employees
At December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 26,400 persons worldwide, comprised of approximately 9,300 salaried employees and approximately 17,100 hourly and craft employees. Our number of employees, particularly hourly and craft, varies in relation to the location, number and size of projects we have in process at any given time. To preserve our project management and technological expertise as core competencies, we continuously recruit and develop qualified personnel, and maintain ongoing training programs for all our key personnel.
The percentage of our employees represented by unions at December 31, 2017 was approximately 5% to 10%. We have agreements, which generally extend up to 3 years, with various unions representing groups of employees at project sites and fabrication facilities in the U.S. and Canada and various other countries. We enjoy good relations with our unions and have not experienced a significant work stoppage in any of our facilities in more than ten years.
