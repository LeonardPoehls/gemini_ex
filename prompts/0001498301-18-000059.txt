General
The Company is a leading national specialty retailer of apparel for women and tween girls. The Company's operations consist of its direct channel operations and approximately 4,600 stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. The Company had annual revenues for Fiscal 2018 of approximately $6.6 billion. 
Change for Growth Program
In Fiscal 2017, the Company announced that it was beginning a multi-year transformation plan with the objective of supporting sustainable long-term growth and increasing shareholder value (the "Change for Growth" program). In Fiscal 2017, the Company (i) refined its operating model to increase the focus on key customer segments, (ii) developed initiatives which will optimize the flow of product through the Company's distribution channels, including its direct channel and its brick-and-mortar retail locations, (iii) consolidated certain support functions into its brand services group, including Human Resources, Real Estate, Non-Merchandise Procurement, and Asset Protection, and (iv) began a review of its store fleet with the goal of reducing the number of under-performing stores through either rent reductions or store closures, in an effort to increase the overall profitability of the remaining store portfolio and convert sales from these stores into direct channel sales or to nearby store locations. In Fiscal 2018, in addition to continuing a number of the activities started in Fiscal 2017, the Company (i) began to develop new capabilities such as markdown optimization, size pack optimization and localized inventory planning with the goal of allowing it to better compete in the shifting

retail landscape, (ii) enhanced its capability to analyze transaction data to support strategic decisions, and (iii) transitioned certain transaction processing functions within the brand services group to an independent third-party managed-service provider. In connection with the Change for Growth program, the Company realized savings of approximately $135 million in Fiscal 2018 and expects to realize approximately $100 to $125 million in incremental cost savings through Fiscal 2020, bringing the total expected cost savings from these activities, when combined with the $65 million cost savings achieved during Fiscal 2017, to approximately $300 to $325 million. Activities associated with the Change for Growth program are currently expected to continue through Fiscal 2019.
Integration of ANN INC.
In Fiscal 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of ANN INC. ("ANN"), a retailer of women’s apparel, shoes and accessories sold primarily under the Ann Taylor and LOFT brands, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion (the "ANN Acquisition"). During Fiscal 2018, integration activities were substantially completed as the Company (i) completed the post-acquisition integration of ANN’s distribution operations, including the closure and sale of the former ANN distribution facility in Louisville, Kentucky and (ii) realized cost reductions from sourcing merchandise through third-party buying agents. As a result of its integration activities, the Company has realized cumulative integration-related cost savings of approximately $205 million through Fiscal 2018 and expects to realize additional synergies of approximately $30 million subsequent to Fiscal 2018 for a total expected realized savings of approximately $235 million.

Sourcing

The Company's brands source their products through one of three channels - ascena's internal sourcing group (ascena Global Sourcing ("aGS")), third-party buying agents, or directly from market vendors. Factors affecting the selection of sourcing channels include cost, speed to market, merchandise selection, vendor capacity and fashion trends.
Operating through offices located in South Korea, China, India and Bangladesh, aGS maintains direct relationships with manufacturing partners, enabling desired product quality control and speed to market, along with favorable pricing as compared to market vendors. 
Merchandising and Design
The Company continues to focus on building its merchandising and design functions to align with its market positions and support its direct sourcing model. The merchandising and design teams determine inventory needs for the upcoming season in response to fast changing fashion trends and customer preferences.

Advertising and Marketing
The Company uses a combination of broad-based and targeted marketing and advertising strategies to effectively define, evolve, and promote our brands. These strategies are designed to deliver a personalized and relevant shopping experience for our customers and include customer research, advertising and promotional events, window and in-store marketing materials, direct mail marketing, Internet and social media marketing, lifestyle magazines, and other means of communication.
Customer Relationship Management
The Company continues to focus on building our customer relationships and promoting customer loyalty through various programs including brand-specific loyalty and credit card programs. Customers shopping at our brands who are enrolled in our loyalty programs earn reward points that are redeemable toward future purchases. Our brands also offer credit card programs to eligible customers providing additional discounts and promotional offers. These programs provide opportunities to attract new customers, retain and enhance existing customer relationships, and deliver a more personalized shopping experience through a better understanding of our customers' preferences and shopping behaviors. 
Community Service 
ascena and its brands have a rich history of giving. This is demonstrated through ascena cares, which reflects our culture and the extraordinary philanthropic efforts taking place within our organization. Together, the Company has a shared commitment for making the world a better place for the women and girls it serves, for the communities where it lives and works and for our dedicated associates.

Whether through collective partnerships or individual brand outreach efforts, ascena supports the women who buy, make and sell our products. More information about our charitable giving, including the non-profit partners it supports, is available at www.ascenaretail.com.
Competition
The retail apparel industry is highly competitive and increasingly fragmented. The Company competes with numerous retailers, including department stores, off-price retailers, specialty stores and Internet-based retailers, on pricing, styles and fulfillment capability. Our business is vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts, channel shifts and changes in customer preferences. Some of our competitors operate at a lower cost structure, and are able to offer better pricing; others have more sophisticated direct channel or omni-channel capabilities. Examples of our competitive set include but are not limited to Gap Inc., Amazon, Walmart, Macy’s, JCPenney, Target and TJX Companies. Other competitors may enter the markets we serve. If the Company fails to compete successfully, it could face continued sales declines and may need to offer greater discounts to our customers, which could result in decreased profitability. The Company is working aggressively to differentiate our brands and our assortments to reinforce the value proposition it delivers by focusing on our target customers and by offering up-to-date fashion, unique experiences, superior customer service and shopping convenience across our multiple sales channels. 
Merchandise Vendors

The Company purchases its merchandise from many domestic and foreign suppliers. It has no long-term purchase commitments or arrangements with any of our suppliers, and believes that it is not dependent on any one supplier as no third-party supplier accounts for more than 10% of our merchandise purchases. The Company believes that it has good working relationships with its suppliers.
Employees

As of August 4, 2018, the Company has approximately 63,000 employees, 47,000 of whom worked on a part-time basis. The Company typically adds temporary employees during peak selling periods, which vary throughout the year at each of its brands, and adjust the hours they work to coincide with holiday shopping patterns. Additionally, none of its employees are covered by any collective bargaining agreement except for approximately 83 employees of Lane Bryant that are represented by unions. The Company believes that it has good working relations with its employees and unions.
