ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Description of Business and History
 
Evergreen-Agra Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”) was incorporated on June 13, 2008 by filing Articles of Incorporation under the Nevada Secretary of State. The Company was incorporated under the name AMF Capital Group, Inc. In June 2009, the Company changed its name to Blackrock Resources, Inc. In January 2010, the Company changed its name to Artepharm Global Corp. Effective July 20, 2011, the Company changed its name to Sharprock Resources Inc. Effective October 23, 2013 the Company changed its name to Evergreen-Agra, Inc. During the Company’s quarter ended September 30, 2011, the Company shifted its focus from mineral exploration to organic veterinary medical products. In the quarter ended December 31, 2013, the Company shifted its focus to medical marijuana coincident with its acquisition of Evergreen Systems effective November 19, 2013.
 
In May 2017, the Company announced plans to register the company as a closed ended fund to invest in public companies within the pharmaceutical cannabis sector as a whole.

On November 19, 2013, pursuant to a letter of intent dated September 10, 2013, the Company issued 20,000,000 post-split shares of its common stock to Rene Hamouth in exchange for 100% ownership of Evergreen Systems (“ES”). Except for conducting research on the medical marijuana industry, ES had no assets, liabilities, or business operations prior to the acquisition. At closing, the Company also issued 19,600,000 post-split shares of its common stock to Harpreet Sangha (then director and former chief executive officer of the Company from September 19, 2009 to September 1, 2013) for future services to be rendered and 1,000,000 post-split shares of its common stock to Richard Specht (secretary and director of the Company from September 1, 2013 to November 21, 2014) for services rendered. ES became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
The acquisition resulted in a change of control of the Company on November 19, 2013. The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities and operations of Evergreen Systems from its inception on August 15, 2013 to November 19, 2013 and are consolidated with Evergreen-Agra, Inc. thereafter.
 
Search for Business Opportunities
 
The Company’s search will be directed toward medical marijuana assets and small and medium-sized enterprises in that industry which have a desire to become reporting corporations and which are able to provide audited financial statements. While the Company is focused on the medical marijuana industry, the Company does not propose to restrict its search for investment opportunities to any particular geographical area or solely to that industry, and may, therefore, engage in essentially any business, to the extent of its limited resources. The Company’s discretion in the selection of business opportunities is unrestricted, subject to the availability of such opportunities, economic conditions, and other factors. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in finding or acquiring a desirable business opportunity, and no assurance can be given that any acquisition, which does occur, will be on terms that are favorable to the Company or its current stockholders. 
 
The Company may merge with a company that has retained one or more consultants or outside advisors. In that situation, the Company expects that the business opportunity will compensate the consultant or outside advisor. As of the date of this filing, there have been no discussions, agreements or understandings with any party regarding the possibility of a merger or acquisition between the Company and such other company. Consequently, the Company is unable to predict how the amount of such compensation would be calculated at this time.
 
The Company will not restrict its search to any specific kind of firm or type of assets, but may acquire a venture, which is in its preliminary or development stage, one which is already in operation, or in a more mature stage of its corporate existence, or simply acquire assets from which it will build its (desire to have its shares publicly traded, or may seek other perceived advantages which the Company may offer.
 
Evaluation of Business Opportunities 
 
The analysis of business opportunities will be under the supervision of the Company’s management and directors, who are not professional business analysts. In analyzing prospective business opportunities, management will consider such matters as available technical, financial and managerial resources; working capital and other financial requirements; history of operations, if any; prospects for the future; nature of present and expected competition; the quality and experience of management services which may be available and the depth of that management; the potential for further research, development, or exploration; specific risk factors not now foreseeable, but which then may be anticipated to impact the proposed activities of the Company; the potential for growth or expansion; the potential for profit; the perceived public recognition or acceptance of products, services, or trades; name identification; and other relevant factors. In many instances, it is anticipated that the historical operations of a specific business opportunity may not necessarily be indicative of the potential for the future because of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the possible need to expand substantially, shift marketing approaches, change product emphasis, change or substantially augment management, raise capital and the like. To the extent possible, the Company intends to utilize written reports and personal investigation to evaluate the above factors. Prior to making a decision to participate in a business opportunity, the Company will generally request that it be provided with written materials regarding the business opportunity containing as much relevant information as possible, including, but not limited to, such items as a description of products, services and company history; management resumes; financial information; available projections, with related assumptions upon which they are based; an explanation of proprietary products and services; evidence of existing patents, trademarks, or service marks, or rights thereto; present and proposed forms of compensation to management; a description of transactions between such company and its affiliates during the relevant periods; a description of present and required facilities;, an analysis of risks and competitive conditions; a financial plan of operation and estimated capital requirements; audited financial statements, or if they are not available at that time, unaudited financial statements, together with reasonable assurance that audited financial statements would be able to be produced within a required period of time; and the like.

The Company is currently subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Under the Exchange Act, any merger or acquisition candidate will become subject to the same reporting requirements of the Exchange Act as the Company following consummation of any merger or acquisition. Thus, in the event the Company successfully completes the acquisition of or merger with an operating business entity, that business entity must provide audited financial statements for at least two most recent fiscal years or, in the event the business entity has been in business for less than two years, audited financial statements will be required from the period of inception. Acquisition candidates that do not have or are unable to obtain the required audited statements will not be considered appropriate for acquisition.
 
Management believes that various types of potential merger or acquisition candidates might find a business combination with the Company to be attractive. These include acquisition candidates desiring to create a public market for their shares in order to enhance liquidity for current stockholders, acquisition candidates which have long-term plans for raising capital through public sale of securities and believe that the possible prior existence of a public market for their securities would be beneficial, and acquisition candidates which plan to acquire additional assets through issuance of securities rather than for cash, and believe that the possibility of development of a public market for their securities will be of assistance in that process. Acquisition candidates, who have a need for an immediate cash infusion, are not likely to find a potential business combination with the Company to be an attractive alternative. Nevertheless, the Company has not conducted market research and is not aware of statistical data which would support the perceived benefits of a merger or acquisition transaction for the owners of a business opportunity. The Company is unable to predict when it may participate in a business opportunity. It expects, however, that the analysis of specific proposals and the selection of a business opportunity may take several months or more. There can also be no assurances that we are able to successfully pursue a business opportunity. In that event, there is a substantial risk to the Company that failure to complete a business combination will significantly restrict its business operation and force management to cease operations and liquidate the Company.
 
Bankruptcy or similar proceedings
 
We have not been the subject of a bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings.
 
Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive industry, many of our competitors have financial resources, staff and facilities substantially greater than ours. The principal area of competition is encountered in the financial ability to cost effectively acquire prospects and then exploit such prospects. Competition for the acquisition of exploration properties is intense, with many properties available in a competitive bidding process in which we may lack technological information or expertise available to other bidders. Therefore, we may not be successful in acquiring, exploring and developing profitable properties in the face of this competition. No assurance can be given that a sufficient number of suitable exploration properties will be available for acquisition, exploration and development.
Employees
 
We have no significant employees other than our officers and directors. We plan to retain independent consultants on a contract basis to conduct the work to carry out our plan of operations.
Research and Development Expenditures
 
We have not incurred any research or development expenditures since our incorporation.

In addition, we will file Form 8-K and other proxy and information statements from time to time as required.
