Our Business
We are primarily focused on selling our existing water rights and storage credits that we own in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico. The long-term future demand for our existing water assets is driven by population and economic growth relative to currently available water supplies in the southwestern United States. We have developed sources of water for municipal and industrial use, either from existing supplies of water, such as water used for agricultural purposes, acquired unappropriated (previously unused) water, or discovered new water sources based on science and targeted exploration. We are not a water utility, and do not currently intend to enter into regulated utility activities.

A water right is the legal right to divert water and put it to beneficial use. Water rights are real property rights which can be bought and sold and are commonly measured in acre-feet (“AF”), which is a measure of the volume of water required to cover an area of one acre to a depth of one foot and is equal to 325,850 gallons. The value of a water right depends on a number of factors, which may include location, the seniority of the right, whether or not the right is transferable, or if the water can be moved from one location to another. We believe we have purchased water rights at prices consistent with their then current use, which was typically agricultural in nature, with the expectation that the value would increase as we converted the water rights through the development process to a higher use, such as municipal and industrial use. We acquired and developed water resources with the expectation that such water resources would be the most competitive source of water (the most economical source of water supply) to support new growth in municipalities or new commercial and industrial projects.
Over the past six years, the population growth of these states also exceeded the national growth rate collectively and individually, with the exception of New Mexico. According to the Census Bureau’s estimate of state population changes for the period April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2017, Nevada’s growth rate was 11.02%, Arizona 9.77%, Colorado 11.49%, and New Mexico 1.4%. These population growth statistics compare to the national total growth rate of 5.5% over the same period.
Historically, a significant portion of the Southwest’s water supplies have come from the Colorado River. The balance is provided by other surface rights, such as rivers and lakes, groundwater (water pumped from underground aquifers), and water previously stored in reservoirs or aquifers. Prolonged droughts (decreased snow pack runoff and the related decreased surface water) and rapid population growth in the past twenty years have exacerbated the region’s general water scarcity.
In December 2012, the U.S. Department of the Interior released a report titled: The Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study, examining the future water demands on the Colorado River Basin. The report projects water supply and demand imbalances throughout the Colorado River Basin and adjacent areas over the next 50 years. The average imbalance in future supply and demand is projected to be greater than 3.2 million acre-feet per year by 2060. The study projects that the largest increase in demand will come from municipal and industrial users as a result of population growth. The Colorado River Basin currently provides water to some 40 million people, and the study estimates that this number could nearly double to approximately 76.5 million people by 2060, under a rapid growth scenario.
Certain areas of the Southwest confronting long-term growth have insufficient known supplies of water to support their future economic and population growth. The inefficient allocation of available water between agricultural users and municipal or industrial users, the lack of available known water supplies in a particular location, or inadequate infrastructure to fully utilize or store existing and new water supplies provide opportunities for us to apply our water resource development expertise.
The development of our water assets required significant capital and expertise. A complete project, from acquisition, through development, permitting, and sale is typically a long-term endeavor. In the regions in which we operate, new housing, and commercial and industrial developments require an assured, or sustainable, water supply (for example, in Arizona, access to water supplies for at least 100 years is required) before a permit for the development will be issued.
We have acquired or developed water rights and water related assets in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Colorado, and New Mexico. We also developed and operated our own water storage facility near Phoenix, Arizona, utilize water storage capacity operated by third parties in Arizona, and “bank,” or store, water with municipalities in Nevada and New Mexico.
We have also entered into “teaming” and joint resource development arrangements with third parties who have water assets but lack the capital or expertise to commercially develop these assets. The first of these arrangements was a water delivery teaming agreement in southern Nevada with the Lincoln County Water District (“Lincoln/Vidler”), which is developing water resources in Lincoln County, Nevada. In northern Nevada, we have also entered into a joint development agreement with Carson City and Lyon County, Nevada to develop and provide water resources in Lyon County as well as a water banking agreement with Washoe County in Reno, Nevada.

We generate revenues by:

• | selling our developed water rights to real estate developers, power generating facilities or other commercial and industrial users who must secure rights to an assured, or sustainable, supply of water in order to receive permits for their development projects; 


• | selling our developed water rights to water utilities, municipalities and other government agencies for their specific needs, including to support population growth;


• | selling our stored water to state agencies, commercial developers or municipalities that have either exhausted their existing water supplies or require reserves for future water obligations, or, in instances where our water represents the most economical source of water, for their commercial projects or communities; and


• | leasing our water, or land.

We owned the following significant water resource and water storage assets at December 31, 2017:
Fish Springs Ranch
We own a 51% membership interest in, and are the managing partner of, Fish Springs Ranch, LLC (“FSR”), which owns the Fish Springs Ranch and other properties totaling approximately 7,313 acres in Honey Lake Valley in Washoe County, approximately 40 miles north of Reno, Nevada. FSR also owns 12,984 acre-feet of permitted water rights related to the properties of which 7,984 acre-feet are designated as water credits, transferable to other areas within Washoe County (such as Reno and Sparks) to support community development. Although the additional 5,000 AF has been approved and permitted by the Nevada State Engineer, existing federal rights of way will need to be updated before such water is transferable. To date, we have funded all of the operational expenses, development, and construction costs incurred in this partnership. Certain of the development and construction costs are treated as preferred capital under the partnership agreement which among other things, entitles us to receive interest on the initial balance of the preferred capital and the accumulated interest at the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 450 basis points. The preferred capital and accumulated interest is first in line to be paid out as the partnership generates sufficient revenue. At December 31, 2017 the balance in the preferred capital account including $75 million of accrued interest, was $169.6 million and the associated interest rate was 6.2%.
During 2006, we started construction of a pipeline and an electrical substation to provide the power required to pump the water to the north valleys region of Reno. In July 2008, we completed construction of and dedicated our pipeline and associated infrastructure to Washoe County, Nevada under the terms of an Infrastructure Dedication Agreement (“IDA”) between Washoe County and FSR. Under the provisions of the IDA, Washoe County is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the pipeline and we own the exclusive right to the capacity of the pipeline to allow for the sale of water for future economic development in the north valley area of Reno. Our 7,984 acre-feet of water that has regulatory approval to be imported to the north valleys of Reno is available for sale under a Water Banking Agreement entered into between FSR and Washoe County. Under the Water Banking Agreement, Washoe County holds our water rights in trust. We can sell our water credits to developers, who must then dedicate the water to the local water utility for service. In December 2014, Washoe County Water Utilities merged with the Truckee Meadows Water Authority (“TMWA”), consolidating water supply service in Washoe County. Also effective at the end of 2014, FSR, Washoe County, and TMWA consented to the Assignment of the Water Banking Agreement and the IDA to the Truckee Meadows Water Authority.
Carson/Lyon
The capital of Nevada, Carson City, and Lyon County are located in the western part of the state, close to Lake Tahoe and the border with California. While Carson City’s housing growth has been and is expected to be minimal due to land constraints, there is planned growth for the Dayton corridor, directly east of Carson City. The planned growth in this area is anticipated to be driven by the employment growth at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center (“TRIC”) and the construction of the extension of the USA Parkway, completed in August 2017, which connects Interstate route 80 to TRIC and the extension connects Interstate route 80 and TRIC to U.S. route 50 near Silver Springs, Lyon County. There are currently few existing water sources to support future growth and development in the Dayton corridor area and we have worked with Carson City and Lyon County for several years on ways to deliver water to support this expected growth.
We have development and improvement agreements with both Carson City and Lyon County to provide water resources for planned future growth in Lyon County and to connect, or “intertie,” the municipal water systems of Carson City and Lyon County. The agreements allow for certain river water rights owned or controlled by us to be conveyed for use in Lyon County. The agreements also allow us to bank water with Lyon County and authorize us to build the infrastructure to upgrade and inter-connect the Carson City and Lyon County water systems.
 5

We own or control water rights consisting of both Carson River agriculture designated water rights and certain municipal and industrial designated water rights. We anticipate that we will have up to 4,000 acre-feet available for municipal use in Lyon County for future development, if and when demand occurs, principally by means of delivery through the new infrastructure we constructed.
Vidler Arizona Recharge Facility
We built and received the necessary permits to operate a full-scale water “recharge” facility that allowed us to bank water underground in the Harquahala Valley, Arizona. “Recharge” is the process of placing water into storage underground. When needed, the water will be “recovered,” or removed from storage, by ground water wells. This stored water creates a long term storage credit (“LTSC”).
We hold recharged Colorado River water at this facility, which is a primary source of water for the Lower Basin States of Arizona, California, and Nevada. The water storage facility is strategically located adjacent to the Central Arizona Project (“CAP”) aqueduct, a conveyance canal running from Lake Havasu to Phoenix and Tucson. Our recharged water was purchased from surplus flows of CAP water. Proximity to the CAP provides a competitive advantage as it minimizes the cost of water conveyance of our LTSCs.
Potential users include industrial companies, power-generating companies, developers, and local governmental political subdivisions in Arizona, and out-of-state users such as municipalities and water agencies in Nevada and California. The Arizona Water Banking Authority (“AWBA”) has the responsibility for intrastate and interstate storage of water for governmental entities. To date, we have not stored water at the facility for any third party and there is no longer excess water which can be banked.
While Arizona was the only southwestern state with surplus flows of Colorado River water available for storage, there is little to no surplus flows available to us as drought conditions have reduced the flow of the Colorado River and other water users have fully utilized their water allocations. In the future, we do not anticipate purchasing and storing surplus flows of Colorado River water and we have discontinued using the recharge element of the storage site. At December 31, 2017, we had LTSCs of approximately 251,000 acre-feet of water in storage at the facility. To date, we have not generated any revenue from selling our stored water at this facility.
Phoenix AMA Water Storage
As of December 31, 2017, we owned approximately 54,000 acre-feet of LTSCs stored in the Arizona Active Management Area (“AMA”), approximately 44,000 acre-feet of which is in the Roosevelt Water Conservation District (“RWCD”). For the purposes of storing water, the RWCD is part of the Phoenix AMA, which corresponds to the Phoenix metropolitan area. Accordingly, water stored in the AMA may be recovered and used anywhere in the AMA and could have a variety of uses for commercial developments within the Phoenix metropolitan area. All of the storage sites we utilize within the AMA are operated by third parties.
Harquahala Valley Ground Water Basin
Any new residential development in Arizona must obtain a permit from the Arizona Department of Water Resources certifying a “designated assured water supply” sufficient to sustain the development for at least 100 years. Harquahala Valley groundwater meets the designation of assured water supply.
Under Arizona law, the property and water rights in the Harquahala Valley are located in one of three areas in the state from which groundwater may be withdrawn and transferred from a rural area to a metropolitan area. In July 1998, we were granted approval for the transportation of three acre-feet of groundwater per acre of previously irrigated ground, totaling 3,837 acre-feet of groundwater, from Harquahala Valley into the Phoenix-Scottsdale metropolitan area. During 2011, we were granted approval for 9,877 acre-feet of groundwater, which included the prior 3,837 acre-feet awarded.
At December 31, 2017, we own 1,926 acres of land and have the ability to utilize 6,040 acre-feet of groundwater for development within the Harquahala Basin. The Analysis of Adequate Water Supply for the 6,040 acre-feet must be renewed before December 2021 in order to maintain these rights.
In addition, the area in and around the Harquahala Valley appears to be a desirable area to site natural gas fired and solar power-generating plants. The site’s proximity to energy transmission lines and the high solarity in the region are strengths of the location. The water assets we own in this region could potentially provide a water source for energy plants that might be constructed in this area.

Lincoln County, Nevada Water Delivery and Teaming Agreement
Lincoln/Vidler entered into a water delivery teaming agreement to locate and develop water resources in Lincoln County, Nevada for planned projects under the County’s master plan. Under the agreement, proceeds from sales of water will be shared equally after Vidler is reimbursed for the expenses incurred in developing water resources in Lincoln County. Lincoln/Vidler has filed applications for more than 100,000 acre-feet of water rights with the intention of supplying water for residential, commercial, and industrial use, as contemplated by the county’s approved master plan. We believe that this is the only known new source of water for Lincoln County. Although it is uncertain, Vidler currently anticipates that over the long-term, up to 40,000 acre-feet of water rights will ultimately be permitted from these applications, and put to use for planned projects in Lincoln County.
Tule Desert Groundwater Basin
Lincoln/Vidler jointly filed permit applications in 1998 for approximately 14,000 acre-feet of water rights for industrial use from the Tule Desert Groundwater Basin in Lincoln County, Nevada. In November 2002, the Nevada State Engineer awarded Lincoln/Vidler a permit for 2,100 acre-feet of water rights, which Lincoln/Vidler subsequently sold in 2005, and ruled that an additional 7,240 acre-feet could be granted pending additional studies by Lincoln/Vidler (the “2002 Ruling”). Subsequent to the 2002 Ruling and consistent with the Nevada State Engineer’s conditions, we completed these additional engineering and scientific studies.
On April 15, 2010, Lincoln/Vidler and the Nevada State Engineer announced that we entered into a Settlement Agreement with respect to litigation between the parties regarding the amount of water to be permitted in the Tule Desert Groundwater Basin. The Settlement Agreement resulted in the granting to Lincoln/Vidler of the original application of 7,240 acre-feet of water rights with an initial 2,900 acre-feet of water rights available for sale or lease by Lincoln/Vidler. The balance of the water rights (4,340 acre-feet) is the subject of staged pumping and development over the next several years to further refine the modeling of the basin and potential impacts, if any, from deep aquifer pumping in the remote, unpopulated desert valley in Lincoln County, Nevada.
The Tule Desert Groundwater Basin water resources were developed by Lincoln/Vidler to support the Lincoln County Recreation, Conservation and Development Act of 2004 (the “Land Act”) and Vidler’s proposed Toquop Power generation project, as discussed below. The water permitted under the Settlement Agreement is anticipated to provide sufficient water resources to support any development of the Toquop Power generation project and a portion of Land Act properties.
Lincoln County Power Plant Project
We developed the Toquop Power project. We are finalizing the required studies and National Environmental Protection Act (“NEPA”) permits for the project. We continue to engage in discussions with potential energy generation partners capable of building a power generation facility in Lincoln County. We own 100% of this power plant project, as it is not part of the Lincoln/Vidler teaming agreement.

Kane Springs
In 2005, Lincoln/Vidler agreed to sell water to a developer of Coyote Springs, a new planned residential and commercial development 60 miles north of Las Vegas, as and when supplies were permitted from Lincoln/Vidler’s existing applications in Kane Springs, Nevada. Lincoln/Vidler currently has priority applications for approximately 17,375 acre-feet of water in Kane Springs for which the Nevada State Engineer has requested additional data before making a determination on the applications from this groundwater basin. The actual permits received may be for a lesser quantity, which cannot be accurately predicted.
Currently, we have an option agreement with a developer to sell our remaining 500 acre-feet of water rights we own in this area at a price of $6,358 per acre-foot that is escalated at 7.5% per year from September 2017. The agreement expires in September 2019 and requires an annual option fee of $60,000 to maintain the rights under the option. To date, the developer has made all required annual option payments.
The following table summarizes our other water rights and real estate assets at December 31, 2017:

Name and location of asset | Brief description | Present commercial use 
Nevada: | | 
Truckee River Water Rights | Approximately 299 acre-feet of Truckee River water rights permitted for municipal use. | Water rights are available to support development through sale, lease, or partnering arrangements. 
Dry Lake | Vidler owns 595 acres of agricultural and ranch land in Dry Lake Valley North. Lincoln/Vidler owns the 1,009 acre-feet of permitted agricultural groundwater rights associated with the land.Located in Lincoln County. | Water rights and land are available to support development through sale, lease, or partnering arrangements. 
Muddy River | 267 acre-feet of water rights.Located 35 miles east of Las Vegas. | Currently leased to farmers in the Muddy River Irrigation Company. 
Dodge Flat | 1,428 acre-feet of permitted municipal and industrial use water rights, and 1,068 acres of land.Located in Washoe County, east of Reno. | Water rights and land are currently under contract.In November 2014, we entered into an option agreement with a solar developer for the potential development of a solar power project of up to 180 megawatts. 
Colorado: | | 
Tunnel | Approximately 155 acre-feet of water rights.Located in Summit County (the Colorado Rockies), near Breckenridge. | 59 acre-feet of water leased under long term leases. 96 acre-feet are available for sale or lease. 
New Mexico: | | 
Campbell Ranch | Application for a new appropriation of 350 acre-feet of ground water. Vidler is in partnership with the land owner. The water rights would be used for a new residential and commercial development.Located 25 miles east of Albuquerque. | In November 2014, our application was denied by the New Mexico State Engineer causing us to record an impairment loss of $3.5 million which reduced the capitalized costs and other assets of this project to zero. We appealed this decision on November 19, 2014. 
Lower Rio Grande Basin | Approximately 1,215 acre-feet of agricultural water rights.Located in Dona Ana and Sierra Counties. | Water is available for sale, lease or other partnering opportunities.In 2014, we entered into a long term lease for a portion of these water rights. 
Middle Rio Grande Basin | Approximately 99 acre-feet of water rights permitted for municipal use.Located in Santa Fe and Bernalillo Counties. | Water is available for sale, lease, or other partnering opportunities.

We also own investments in small businesses which have typically been venture capital-type situations.The most significant at December 31, 2017 is Mindjet Inc. (“Mindjet”), which is a privately held company located in San Francisco, California that provides software to help business innovation. The investment is comprised of common and preferred stock and a convertible debt security. The investment is held at cost and included in investments in our consolidated financial statements while the outstanding loan balance is included in other assets. At December 31, 2017, we controlled 19.3% of the voting stock of the company and the carrying value of our total investment in Mindjet was $2.3 million, comprised of $1.3 million in preferred stock and a loan of $1 million.
It is reasonably possible given the volatile nature of the software industry that circumstances may change in the future which could require us to record impairment losses on our investments included in this segment.
