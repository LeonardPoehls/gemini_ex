Item 1. Business
Organization
 
We are a leading provider of software-as-a-service, or SaaS, financial technology, or fintech, solutions to the financial services industry. We provide traditional financial institutions and alternative financial service, or AFS, providers with innovative mobile and other solutions to enable them to offer a suite of leading-edge mobile financial services to their customers through the Internet, or cloud-based, access. As a SaaS provider, we develop, host and maintain software solutions that we license to our clients. We serve three primary markets in the United States: banks, credit unions and AFS providers, which includes providers of non-traditional banking services such as reloadable prepaid cards and check cashing services. In the future, we intend to expand outside of the United States, including Latin America and Europe, as opportunities present themselves.
 
We have been expanding our suite of available fintech solutions. One of our recent solutions, Select Mobile Money, is a prepaid mobile money platform that seamlessly links various mobile banking features with a prepaid debit card issued by financial institutions or AFS providers. This solution enables card users, i.e., customers of our client financial institutions or AFS providers, to conveniently manage their card accounts through an easy-to-use integrated mobile application, or app, with multiple features that is downloaded onto their smart phone or tablet and, by adding a suite of available mobile financial services linked to their card accounts, enhances the card’s usefulness and the cardholder’s mobile banking experience. For example, prepaid cardholders using our application may deposit paper checks and direct payroll deposits into their prepaid card account, access cash from their prepaid card account at any automated teller machine, or ATM, and check their prepaid card account balance and transaction history. We believe that our Select Mobile Money solutions are setting the industry standard for reloadable prepaid mobile money solutions.
 
Our Select Mobile Money solutions comprise two distinct mobile banking technology solutions: first, a white label mobile money platform for larger financial institutions and AFS providers that already have a reloadable prepaid card program and wish to enhance it by integrating a feature rich app; and second, an end-to-end reloadable prepaid card program, which we call Select Mobile Money-Express, or SMM-X, offered to all banks, credit unions and AFS providers of all sizes that would like to deploy a complete reloadable prepaid card program, comprising a prepaid debit card, an integrated mobile app and program management.
 
Our Select Mobile Money solutions are designed to specifically meet the needs of millennials, the “unbanked” (those who have no formal relationship with a bank or credit union, prefer not to use a traditional checking account, or who do not meet the minimum balance required to avoid high bank fees) and the “under-banked” (those who have only a minimal relationship with a bank or credit union). These solutions provide end-users with convenient and secure anywhere and anytime mobile access via the Internet to a variety of convenient self-service mobile banking services through an easy-to-use integrated mobile application with multiple features downloaded onto their smart phone or tablet and linked to a reloadable prepaid card. Both our white label and our SMM-X prepaid mobile money solutions support advanced analytics, which we believe can help our clients gain a competitive advantage by enhancing the prepaid cardholder experience and keeping their customers engaged. As a result, we are experiencing a growing demand for these solutions by financial institutions and AFS providers.
 
As of December 31, 2016, our business has historically focused on offering a full suite of consumer and business remote deposit check capture, or RDC, products that enable financial institutions to provide their customers with the ability to conveniently deposit their checks remotely anytime, anywhere. While we continue to offer these solutions, we recently expanded our focus to include prepaid mobile money solutions. Our latest innovations are a mobile remote payment capture solution, which we call Select Mobile NowPay, which enables enterprises to accept check payments submitted via their customers’ mobile devices, and our mobile account opening solution, which we call Select Mobile Account Opening, which streamlines the account opening process by utilizing photo imaging to capture customer data and auto-populate an account opening application form for checking, savings, credit card and other types of accounts.
 
On January 20, 2017, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No: 333-215650), pursuant to which we intend to raise up to $13.8 million in cash proceeds and list our common stock on an exchange owned by the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (our “Offering”).
 
Industry
 
Mobile Financial Services
 
We believe that the mobile channel will become the primary channel for customers to interact with financial institutions and AFS providers in the United States, and that these financial services providers will seek to offer more services through the mobile channel to strengthen customer loyalty. Mobile financial services resonate with financial services providers because mobile technologies provide these service providers a means to level the competitive playing field and compete with larger financial institutions. In addition, with mobile offerings, branch location is no longer a determining factor of where to bank. According to a December 2015 report by Javelin Strategy & Research, or Javelin, titled “2015 Mobile Banking, Smartphone, and Tablet Forecast,” the proportion of weekly mobile bankers exceeded that of weekly branch bankers for the first time in 2015.

Prepaid Mobile Money
 
A reloadable prepaid card provides the convenience of a debit card, including a secure way to shop online and make other purchases. Reloadable prepaid cards are generally accepted everywhere MasterCard and Visa are accepted. Unlike a debit card, a reloadable prepaid card account is prefunded by the cardholder and it cannot be over-drawn. Card usage is limited to the balance available on the account. This limits the cardholder’s exposure to overdraft fees and other related penalties, and removes the credit history requirements normally required to open a traditional bank account. A prepaid card can be a valuable budgeting tool. It is sometimes used to help teens and young adults learn money management skills.
 
Reloadable prepaid cards are a convenient and safer alternative that have less serious consequences than losing cash or high limit credit cards should the card be lost or stolen. If a reloadable prepaid card is stolen, the loss is limited only to the cash balance remaining on the card, and no valuable financial information is lost or compromised.
 
We believe that the reloadable prepaid card will continue to grow in popularity across all income groups for budgeting, payroll, student usage, travel and more. According to a November 2015 Business Insider Intelligence report, titled “The Prepaid Cards Report: The rise of reloadable cards could affect the way millennials approach banking,” prepaid cards accounted for 800 million transactions worth $20 billion in the United States in 2003, and jumped to 9.2 billion transactions worth $220 billion in the United States in 2012. In that study, Business Insider also estimated that prepaid card volumes in the U.S. market would top $317 billion in 2015.
 
RDC Products
 
Federal legislation commonly referred to as “Check 21” has made the RDC service possible. Implemented in October 2004, this legislation allows financial institutions to clear checks based upon images of the original items instead of having to transport the original check to the paying bank for clearing. The commonly viewed benefits of this service include customer convenience, better deposit availability, reduced non-sufficient funds, reduced transportation costs and eliminating the need to physically transfer the check during the clearing process.
 
We believe that checks are the preferred form of payment for small to medium size businesses compared to other forms of payment because we believe these businesses perceive checks to be less expensive. We also believe that RDC will become an increasingly popular banking service for consumers as it becomes more widely available and consumers become more comfortable with the technology. We believe that our remote and mobile RDC solutions enable banks and credit unions to increase customer satisfaction among their business and consumer customers, grow deposits in a low-cost manner, reduce transaction costs and decrease traffic at bricks-and-mortar branches.
 
Mobile Check Payment
 
Our mobile check payment solution, Select Mobile NowPay, enables the biller to offer its customers the ability to use their mobile devices to take a photo of a check and submit the digital image of the check as payment on their loan or other recurring bill. We believe that a self-service mobile check payment option that fits customers’ lifestyles, meets demand for easier and more convenient payment options and supports more timely payments will gain acceptance in the consumer lending market. We believe that the primary target markets for this solution include lenders, such as special purpose consumer finance subsidiaries of large retailers and captive auto finance companies, and loan servicing companies.
Mobile Account Opening for Consumers
 
Traditional mobile account opening, which requires mobile customers to fill out tedious on-screen forms is cumbersome and time consuming and can potentially lead to account abandonment, errors and incomplete application forms. With consumers’ emerging preference for the mobile channel, we believe that fast and efficient mobile account opening will become increasingly more important to the ongoing success of all financial services companies. By allowing consumers to take photos instead of entering data, our Select Mobile Account Opening solution can streamline the account opening process, reduce the number of human errors resulting from manually completing inaccurate data or failing to complete all relevant or required fields in the application forms, and consequently can reduce new account abandonment rates and enhance the overall account opening experience.
Our Solutions
 
Prepaid Mobile Money Solutions: Select Mobile Money
 
Our prepaid mobile money solutions, Select Mobile Money, comprise two distinct mobile banking technology solutions: a white label mobile money platform for larger financial institutions and AFS providers that already have a reloadable prepaid card program and wish to enhance it by integrating a feature rich app; and an end-to-end reloadable prepaid card program, which we call Select Mobile Money-Express, or SMM-X offered to all banks, credit unions and AFS providers of all sizes. Both our white label and our SMM-X prepaid mobile money solutions support advanced analytics, which we believe can help our clients by enhancing the prepaid cardholder experience and keeping their customers engaged.

Our acquisition of certain mobile money assets from DeviceFidelity, Inc. in March 2014 has enabled us to enter the prepaid mobile money market. In March 2013, prior to the acquisition, DeviceFidelity’s mobile wallet platform (currently, our Select Mobile Money solution) won the 2013 Paybefore Award for the Best-in-Category Outstanding Mobile Wallet and Application. In February 2015, the Navy Federal Credit Union’s Visa Buxx app, which is powered by our white label Select Mobile Money prepaid platform, was the 2015 Paybefore Awards Best-in-Category winner of the judges’ choice award.
 
Our White Label Mobile Money Platform
 
Our white label mobile banking platform enables financial institutions and AFS providers to offer their prepaid cardholders an integrated mobile application with multiple features, which currently include the ability to:

● | deposit a paper check directly into the cardholder’s prepaid card account, 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | direct payroll deposits into the cardholder’s prepaid card account, 
● | access cash from the cardholder’s prepaid card account at any automated teller machine, or “ATM,” 
● | check account balance and transaction history, 
● | access a national coupon network, 
● | make card to card money transfer, 
● | make international money transfers and 
● | locate surcharge-free ATMs and cash loading locations. 

 
As of December 31, 2016, we entered into contracts for the sale of 47 white label mobile money products, of which 22 products were active.
 
Our Select Mobile Money Express Platform (SMM-X)
 
We offer our SMM-X solution, an end-to-end reloadable prepaid card program, to all banks, credit unions and AFS providers of all sizes that would like to deploy a complete reloadable prepaid card program, comprising a prepaid debit card, an integrated mobile app and program management. This program is designed for financial institutions and AFS providers that either do not have the capability or resources to launch or service their own independent reloadable prepaid card program or do not wish to assume the risks and burdens associated with deploying their own independent reloadable prepaid card program. Our SMM-X mobile application provides a full suite of mobile banking services that help our clients’ prepaid cardholders to better manage their prepaid card and their money, with the same features currently available under our white label mobile banking platform.
 
In contrast to our white label mobile money solution, deploying our SMM-X solution typically does not require significant upfront customization or integration efforts. We believe this is advantageous because it allows this solution to be more easily and timely implemented by clients of all sizes. We also believe that the SMM-X solution is advantageous to us because our financial model for this solution is based principally on future transaction and/or user fee components, which are recurring in nature.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we entered into contracts for the sale of a total of nine SMM-X products, of which two were active.
 
RDC Solutions
 
Our RDC solutions are composed of various software applications that permit a business or consumer to scan or take a picture of a check by using a smart phone, tablet or other device (e.g., a desktop computer that is connected to a scanner) and then transmit the resulting image to a bank for posting and clearing. These various software applications are developed to be compatible with both Windows and Mac operating systems, and are marketed and sold with various features and levels of functionality to banks and credit unions in the United States. Our main RDC solutions are marketed under the following names:
 

● | Select Business Merchant Capture—This product provides our clients’ business customers with the ability to scan and deposit checks from their PC or Mac desktop computer or mobile device, eliminating trips to the bank to deposit checks. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Select Mobile Deposit—This product enables our clients to offer their consumer customers the ability to deposit their checks anywhere, anytime by taking a picture of the front and back of the endorsed check using a mobile device. Additional fraud protection is provided through integration with CheckReview, our cloud-based SaaS proprietary technology that helps identify potential fraud, by viewing and validating the digital image of the check in real time and detecting checks submitted for deposit more than once. 
● | Select Mobile Deposit-Express—This product is an unbranded, standalone version of Select Mobile Deposit we developed for iPhone and Android phones to minimize start-up costs and simplify deployment of mobile deposit for small financial institutions that lack the resources to go to market with their own branded mobile deposit apps. 

 
As of December 31, 2016, we entered into contracts for the sale of 819 RDC products, of which 575 RDC products were active.

Remote Payment Capture Solution: Select Mobile NowPay
 
Select Mobile NowPay is a remote payment capture solution that enables financing companies and other lenders to offer their customers the convenience of making a payment on a loan or other recurring debt by using an app on a smartphone to take a photo image of their check and transmit it to the payee. As of December 31, 2016, we sold one Select Mobile NowPay product, which was not yet implemented by the client for use by its customers. We expect our client will begin to deploy or implement this solution in 2017.
Mobile Account Opening for Consumers
 
Select Mobile Account Opening streamlines the account opening process by utilizing photo imaging to capture customer data and auto-populate an account opening application form for checking, savings, credit card and other types of accounts. This SaaS-based solution minimizes the cumbersome and error-prone manual data entry typical of mobile account application forms. Users simply capture a picture of the front and back of their driver’s license, and validated data is used to pre-populate account origination systems and identity verification providers. As of December 31, 2016, we entered into contracts for the sale of a total of five Select Mobile Account Opening products, of which one had been deployed.
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe we have three key competitive strengths.
 
Premier Technology—Our mobile and other innovative solutions, including prepaid mobile money and RDC solutions, enable financial institutions and AFS providers to deploy high-end cloud-based platforms that meet the expectations and needs of their customers.
 
Innovation—We continually drive innovation to ensure that our solutions are best in class and at the forefront of other solutions available in the market. We leverage our technology and take advantage of new opportunities in the mobile payment space.
 
Comprehensive Training and Support Services—We offer comprehensive product training, technical support and marketing support services to our clients to prepare for product launch and beyond, including one-on-one and group training on product use, web-based product training and educational webinars to inform our client’s staff of product features and benefits and how to sell. Our marketing support services include customized marketing collateral, product videos and post-launch contests and promotions to help our clients promote their products and increase customer adoption.
 
Our Objective
 
Our objective is to be the leading innovator and provider of mobile and other innovative technology solutions, including prepaid mobile money solutions and RDC, designed to meet the specific requirements of financial institutions and AFS providers in the market.
Our Strategy
 
To achieve our objective, we are developing new products and enhancements to existing products, focusing on our target markets, marketing and branding our products and services effectively. In addition, we intend to build our sales force, channel partners and resellers, grow revenue from our existing clients, offer our products internationally, and opportunistically pursue acquisitions.
New Products and Product Enhancements
 
We plan to develop new technologies and solutions to enhance our suite of prepaid mobile money, RDC and related products we offer. We are currently focused on the following product enhancements:

● | expanding security sign-on features for our applications, such as touch ID through finger print authentication, iris recognition and retinal scanning; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | developing additional media to enable access to our applications through other devices, including, for example, Apple and Android watches; 
● | expanding the integration of our technologies, such as real time posting of checks, with providers of core banking systems, who we refer to as core providers (for example, Fiserv, FIS, and Jack Henry); and 
● | adding new features to our prepaid mobile money solutions, such as bill payments, international money transfers and coupons. 

Focus on Our Target Markets
 
Using a direct sales force, we focus on banks and credit unions with $500 million to $20 billion in assets and AFS providers that primarily serve the unbanked, under-banked and millennial consumer markets. We believe these institutions represent the best opportunity for acceptance and growth of our prepaid mobile money and RDC solutions because they generally have multiple branches and a significant commercial and/or consumer customer base. Also, many of these institutions often do not have internal marketing capabilities to effectively take advantage of the opportunity that our mobile and other solutions present.

Market and Brand our Solutions and Services Effectively
 
Our marketing strategy has revolved around strengthening brand awareness, building thought leadership and developing and executing targeted lead generation programs promoting our key competitive strengths and innovative products and services.
Build our Internal Sales Force
 
We believe there is significant opportunity to increase our future revenues by increasing the size of our internal sales force, which will increase the number of our clients.
Seek Additional Channel Partners and Resellers
 
We have a number of channel partners and resellers. A channel partner is another company with whom we have integrated our Select Mobile Deposit product into its product offering platform, and that channel partner then sells the integrated solution to a financial institution. A reseller is a sales agent that resells our solutions, currently Select Mobile Deposit and Select Business Merchant Capture, to its clients. We intend to seek new channel partners and resellers which should help us increase the number of our clients.
Grow Revenue from Existing Clients
 
We believe we can continue to grow our revenues from our existing clients by cross selling new solutions and adding new features and functionality into existing solutions. In addition, as our clients add new customers to our solutions, we have experienced revenue growth from increased transactions and user fees.
Offer our Products Internationally
 
To date, we have derived all of our revenues from the U.S. market. We believe that there is an additional growth opportunity for our cloud-based SaaS solutions in international markets.
Pursue Acquisitions
 
While we intend to generate most of our growth organically, we believe there may be opportunities for us in the future to opportunistically pursue acquisitions that will expand our product offerings or bring synergies to our business.
Intellectual Property
 
We generally rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, internal security practices and employee and third-party confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We believe that we possess all proprietary rights necessary to conduct our business.
 Patent Applications
 
We have applied for patents in the United States with regard to how our software is used on the Apple operating system platform and various tablet devices (Android, Microsoft and Apple). We have also applied for patents in the United States with regard to certain aspects of the functionality of our software, including check deposit review, approval and fraud-prevention processes, fees and billing processes used by financial institutions and AFS providers, as well as other capabilities. While these functions are important features of our prepaid mobile money and RDC solutions, we believe that none of them are critical to our overall ability to provide our solutions. Nevertheless, our management does believe that these patents, if ultimately obtained, provide us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace for our prepaid mobile money and RDC services. We have not filed any patent applications outside the United States. The patents applications referred to above are still pending and have not been awarded to date.
Non-Patented Proprietary Technology
 
We develop custom and proprietary software for all of our solutions and products. Our key proprietary software components that we developed for our prepaid mobile money solutions include:

● | financial management tools, including real-time transaction posting, transaction history and fund transfers; 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | a data access gateway that integrates with a processor’s system to connect our prepaid mobile money solutions to the global debit card networks; and 
● | integration of our applications with third party service providers, such as coupon providers, ATM locator service providers and retail service providers. 
Our key proprietary software components that we developed for our RDC solutions include: 
● | decision workflow and business rules, including setting different deposit limits for each customer account and separate financial institution controls; 
● | risk management controls, including duplicate check detection and fraud detection; 
● | a broad integration framework which integrates the financial settlement process for financial institutions, AFS providers, core providers and other financial technology providers; and 
● | returned check management, which is a data feature designed to store information on prior returned checks which our check cashing service provider clients often purchase.

Trademarks
 
We have registered certain trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on the Principal Register. We also rely on the United States on common law rights to certain trademarks. We have not registered any of our trademarks in jurisdictions outside of the United States. Solely for convenience, our trademarks and trade names referred to in this report appear without the ® and ™ symbols, but those references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights, or the right of the applicable licensor to these trademarks and trade names. Additionally, we do not intend for our use or display of other companies’ trade names, trademarks or service marks to imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us, by these other companies.
Outsourced Software Development
 
We outsource software development tasks for our prepaid mobile money solutions and other select development projects to six software developers based in Toronto, Canada, who are our consultants. The work product produced by these consultants is our proprietary software.
 
Licensed Software for our RDC Solutions
 
We also license from third-parties material software products that support our RDC solutions. For example, we license from Mitek Systems Inc. and Parascript, LLC the rights to use their image capture and processing technologies. We license from AQ2 Technologies, LLC its technology for generating check financial settlement files, which includes the pertinent information about the check, for transmission to a financial institution’s core processing platform. We also license from All My Papers software tools to assist with processing returned check files. Server software for these licensed technologies reside in our own offsite data centers, as opposed to being hosted with third party service providers.
 
Indemnification Obligations
 
We are required under our client agreements to indemnify our clients and hold them harmless for any third-party infringement claims relating to our solutions. To the extent we use any licensed software in providing solutions to our clients, we are generally entitled to be indemnified by the software provider for any third-party infringement claims relating to their licensed software.
Competition
 
Prepaid Mobile Money Solutions
 
We are not aware of any direct competitors for our Select Mobile Money solutions. Other mobile platforms in the industry are either not focused on prepaid mobile money solutions or they are offered as ancillary services by core providers such as FIS, Fiserv, Jack Henry and D+H, and are thereby not as current, comprehensive or robust.
 
Monetise is a digital technology company that offers a mobile platform, but we believe it is focused on direct deposit accounts and checking accounts, not prepaid accounts. Our expertise and focus is on developing features and functionality tailored for the prepaid mobile money market.
 
Our prepaid mobile money solutions have a data access gateway that integrates with core banking systems, which are back-end systems that process daily banking transactions and post updates to accounts and other financial records. Core banking systems typically include deposit, loan and credit-processing capabilities, with interfaces to general ledger systems and reporting tools. Having our prepaid mobile money solutions integrate with a core provider’s system enables us to connect to the global debit card networks. As a result, we offer financial institutions and AFS providers a more robust solution than a core provider can offer on its own.
 
FIS, Fiserv, D+H and Jack Henry are the major providers of core banking systems, or core providers. Their technology provides the behind-the-scenes engine that processes all deposits, payments, loans, most transactions and customer data at financial institutions. Many core providers offer mobile banking platforms, but their products are very simple and basic compared to our prepaid mobile money solutions. Everything outside of the core provider’s primary services is considered ancillary. The core provider’s ancillary services tend not to get the same focus for development and updates, and also tend to be inflexible and more expensive.
 
If a client has a need for broader functionality, a core provider will often bring in a partner like us. A core provider can be a competitor, while simultaneously offering us opportunities on which we may partner to provide a more robust prepaid mobile money solution to the client. We have integrated with all the major core providers and expect more opportunities to partner with the major core providers in the future.

RDC Solution
 
Since RDC incorporates both software and hardware solutions, companies involved with these platforms may be considered competitors if they offer a complete solution to their customers. Non-hardware or software companies also offer RDC solutions. These companies typically sell directly to their commercial customers. Pitney Bowes and NCR are two companies we are aware of which offer an RDC solution directly to their customers. Software companies offering RDC solutions include, but are not limited to, Bluepoint Solutions, Fiserv, Goldleaf ProfitStars, Net Deposit, VSoft, Deluxe Corporation (acquired Wausau), and Fidelity Information Services (FIS).
 
Nearly all of these competitors are larger, have more resources, including marketing and sales resources, and have proven viability in RDC and many other related businesses. Competing against these firms presents us with significant challenges and highlights our need to provide excellent products and service that remain innovative.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are not a financial institution or an AFS provider, and therefore we are generally not regulated by the regulatory authorities that regulate financial institutions or AFS providers. However, federal law provides the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) with supervisory and enforcement authority over service providers to certain “covered persons” engaged in offering or providing consumer financial products or services; and we would be subject to such regulatory authority by the CFPB. Additionally, as a provider of fintech solutions to the financial services industry, our clients expect us to be aware of the regulatory requirements and developments applicable to them and maintain the internal controls necessary for their regulatory compliance. We continue to invest the resources required of us to maintain internal controls necessary for our client’s regulatory compliance.
 
For example, our financial institution clients are required to comply with certain regulations under Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as well as certain state regulations relating to financial institutions. Those regulations are designed to establish, implement and maintain such physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to maintain the security and confidentiality of customer data and to protect consumer data privacy.
 
To satisfy our clients’ regulatory requirements and their need to be assured of the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls related to security and availability around their information, we obtain a report on controls at a service organization relevant to security and availability (Service Organization Controls Report (SOC) 2 Type 2) from our independent auditors annually, which we refer to as the SOC 2 Type 2 Report. The SOC 2 Type 2 Report provides a description of the controls necessary to meet the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Trust Services Principles and Criteria, referred to as the TSP Section 100, along with our independent auditor’s tests of our controls to meet the TSP Section 100 and the results of those tests. Upon request, we make this report available to our clients and potential clients.
 
Payment Card Industry Association Compliance
 
Payment Card Industry, or PCI, is a self-regulatory organization founded by its founding members, American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard and Visa Inc. Participating organizations in PCI may include merchants, banks, processors, hardware and software developers and point-of-sale vendors.
 
PCI has defined a set of twelve industry security standards outlined below, called the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS, which is designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment.
 

1. | Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data. 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters. 
3. | Protect stored cardholder data. 
4. | Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks. 
5. | Use and regularly update antivirus software. 
6. | Develop and maintain secure systems and applications. 
7. | Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know. 
8. | Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access. 
9. | Restrict physical access to cardholder data. 
10. | Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data. 
11. | Regularly test security systems and processes. 
12. | Maintain a policy that addresses information security. 


10
--


The PCI founding members have all agreed to incorporate the PCI DSS as part of the technical requirements for each of their data security compliance programs, which effectively means that all merchants, banks, processors, hardware and software developers and point-of-sale vendors must also comply with the PCI DSS.
 
As part of our prepaid mobile money solutions, we have access to and transmit reloadable prepaid card numbers and we also integrate with the reloadable prepaid card issuers’ core system. Therefore, under various agreements with our clients that purchase our prepaid mobile money solutions, we are required to comply with PCI DSS in order to meet these clients’ requirements, and also industry demands and best practices. If we fail to comply, these clients may terminate their agreements with us without any cancelation penalty due from the client. In addition, the PCI governing council may impose a significant monetary penalty on us, depending on the significance of the breach and the number of account holders impacted.
 
Compliance levels are set by the PCI governing body. Our compliance level is PCI level three, which requires an annual attestation of compliance for service providers against the PCI standards. This annual attestation of compliance is prepared by us and submitted to our clients during the fourth quarter of each year.
 
If the number of reloadable prepaid cards we have access and transmit in any calendar year exceeds one million, then our PCI compliance requirements will increase to level two, which entails a full external audit by a PCI-registered qualified security assessor, QSA, a quarterly network scan by an approved scan vender and a report on compliance issued by the QSA. We expect this may occur as early as October 2017. Therefore, we expect to incur additional expenses to satisfy PCI compliance requirements in the future.
 
Research and Development
 
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred research and development costs of $1.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively, to expand the functionality of our products and solutions.
Employees and Consultants
 
We believe our employees have a significant role in the future success of our business. To reflect this, we refer to our employees as associates. Our associates are involved in administration, sales, marketing, technology development, engineering and support.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 63 full-time and two part-time associates, all based in the U.S., of which approximately 34 associates are directly associated with research and product development and client support. The rest of our associates are involved with sales, marketing, finance and administrative functions.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we also have six full-time non-employee consultants based in Toronto, Canada who are software developers that work on software development tasks primarily for our prepaid mobile money solutions and other select development projects.
 
Corporate Information
 
All of our business is conducted entirely by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Cachet Financial Solutions Inc., a Minnesota corporation. Our current corporate organization is depicted below:
 

We were incorporated in Delaware in February 2010. In February 2014 we acquired the business of our subsidiary, and changed our corporate name to “Cachet Financial Solutions, Inc.” Prior to the merger, our corporate name was “DE Acquisition 2, Inc.” We were formed as a “blank check” company with the sole purpose of acquiring a business seeking to become a public reporting company through a merger transaction.
 
Our corporate headquarters and principal executive offices are located at 18671 Lake Drive East, dellFive Business Park G, Minneapolis, MN 55317. Our telephone number is (952) 698-6980.
