ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
-----------------


 
 As used in this annual report, "we", "us", "our", "CBMG", "Company" or "our company" refers to Cellular Biomedicine Group, Inc. and, unless the context otherwise requires, all of its subsidiaries or deemed controlled companies.
  
  Overview
  
 Cellular Biomedicine Group, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company, principally engaged in the development of new treatments for cancerous and degenerative diseases utilizing proprietary cell-based technologies.  Our technology includes two major cell platforms: (i) Immune Cell therapy for treatment of a broad range of cancers using : Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cell (CAR-T), cancer vaccine, and T Central Memory Cell (Tcm) technology, and (ii) human adipose-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells (haMPC) for treatment of joint and autoimmune diseases, with primary research and manufacturing facilities in China.
  
 We are focused on developing and marketing safe and effective cell-based therapies based on our cellular platforms, to treat serious diseases such as cancer, orthopedic diseases, various inflammatory diseases and metabolic diseases. We have developed proprietary practical knowledge in the use of cell-based therapeutics that we believe could be used to help a great number of people suffering from cancer and other serious chronic diseases. We are conducting clinical studies in China for stem cell based therapies to treat knee osteoarthritis (“KOA”). We have completed Phase IIb autologous haMPC KOA clinical study and published its promising results. Led by Shanghai Renji Hospital, one of the largest teaching hospitals in China, we launched Phase I clinical trial of an off-the-shelf allogeneic haMPC (AlloJoin™) therapy for KOA. We have completed patient recruitment and treatment for Phase I clinical studies of KOA on August 5, 2016. We also initiated multiple dose preclinical studies in a Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ("COPD") animal model, and plan to initiate manufacturing of (AlloJoin™) product for KOA preclinical and clinical studies in the United States in 2017.
  
 Our primary target market is Greater China. We believe that the results of our research, acquired knowhow and clinical study results will help to cure or alleviate illness and suffering of the patient. We expect to carry out clinical studies leading to eventual CFDA approval through IND filings and authorized treatment centers throughout Greater China.  
  
 With our acquisition of the University of South Florida’s license on the next generation GVAX vaccine (CD40LGVAX) and its related standard operational procedures (SOPs), we have expanded our immuno-oncology portfolio significantly. We plan to use the knowledge we obtained from the previous phase l clinical study conducted in the U.S. by Moffitt Cancer Center to support an investigator sponsored trial to evaluate the potential synergistic effect of the combination of CD40LGVAX with an anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor, to treat a selected segment of late stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) adenocarcinoma patients. We may also seek approval to conduct clinical trials with leading non-U.S. medical centers or seek partnership for CD40LGVAX sub-license opportunities.
  
 With our recent build-up of multiple cancer therapeutic technologies, we have prioritized our clinical efforts on launching multiple trials for CAR-Ts in several indications and are not actively pursuing the fragmented technical services opportunities. We are striving to build a highly competitive research and development function, a translational medicine team, along with a well established cellular manufacturing capability for clinical grade materials, to support the development of multiple assets in several cancer indications. These efforts will allow us to boost the Company's Immuno-Oncology presence, and pave the way for future partnerships.
  
  Corporate History
  
 Cellular Biomedicine Group, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware and its corporate headquarters located at 19925 Stevens Creek Blvd., Suite 100 in Cupertino, California. The Company is focusing its resources on becoming a biotechnology company bringing therapies to improve the health of patients in China.
  
 Cellular Biomedicine Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (formerly known as EastBridge Investment Group Corporation), was originally incorporated in the State of Arizona on June 25, 2001. The Company's principal activity through June 30, 2005 was to manufacture mobile entertainment products.

 In 2005, the Company decided to exit the mobile entertainment market and dedicate its activities to providing investment related services in Asia, with a strong focus on high GDP growth countries, such as China. The Company concentrated its efforts in the Far East (Hong Kong, mainland China, Australia) and in the United States and sought to provide consulting services necessary for small to medium-size companies to obtain capital to grow their business, either to become public companies in the United States or to find joint venture partners or raise capital to expand their businesses
  
 On February 6, 2013, we completed a merger to acquire Cellular Biomedicine Group Ltd.
  
 In connection with the Merger, effective on March 5, 2013, the Company (formerly named “EastBridge Investment Group Corporation”) changed its name to “Cellular Biomedicine Group, Inc.” In addition in March 2013 we changed our corporate headquarters to 530 University Avenue, #17, Palo Alto, California 94301. 
  
               From February 6, 2013 to June 23, 2014, we operated the Company in two separate reportable segments: (i) Biomedicine Cell Therapy (“Biomedicine”); and (ii) Financial Consulting (“Consulting”).  The Consulting segment was conducted through EastBridge Sub.  On June 23, 2014, the Company announced the discontinuation of the Consulting segment as it no longer fit into management’s long-term strategy and vision.  The Company is continuing to focus its resources on becoming a biotechnology company bringing therapies to improve the health of patients in China.
  
 On September 26, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of Beijing Agreen Biotechnology Co. Ltd. ("AG") and the U.S. patent held by AG’s founder. AG is a biotech company with operations in China, engaged in the development of treatments for cancerous diseases utilizing proprietary cell technologies, which include without limitation, preparation of subset T Cell and clonality assay platform technology for treatment of a broad range of cancers.
  
  Merger with Cellular Biomedicine Group Ltd.
  
 On November 13, 2012, EastBridge Investment Group Corporation (“EastBridge” or “Parent”) and CBMG Acquisition Limited, a British Virgin Islands company and the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (“Merger Agreement”) by and among EastBridge, Merger Sub and Cellular Biomedicine Group Ltd., a British Virgin Islands company (“CBMG BVI”), as amended on January 15, 2013, January 31, 2013 and February 6, 2013, pursuant to which the parties agreed that Merger Sub shall merge with and into CBMG BVI, with CBMG BVI as the surviving entity. The transactions under the Merger Agreement as amended are referred to as the “Merger”. The Merger was subject to customary closing conditions, including, among other things, (a) approval by the shareholders of CBMG BVI, (b) resignations of the departing directors and officers of EastBridge, Merger Sub and CBMG BVI, and (c) execution of certain ancillary agreements, including, but not limited to, executive employment agreements with EastBridge, compliance certificates, lock up agreement and opinions of counsel, as referenced in Article VII of the Merger Agreement.
   
 On December 20, 2012 CBMG BVI obtained shareholder approval by holding an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders, in which holders of a majority of its capital stock approved the merger pursuant to British Virgin Islands law. Since the Merger was structured as a triangular merger in which a wholly owned merger subsidiary of EastBridge merged with CBMG BVI, no stockholder approval on the part of the EastBridge stockholders was required under Delaware law.  We note that although EastBridge issued in excess of 20% of its shares in the merger, since its shares are not listed on a national exchange, no stockholder approval requirement applied to this transaction under any exchange rules.”
  
 On February 5, 2013, the registrant formed a new Delaware subsidiary named EastBridge Investment Corp. (“EastBridge Sub”). Pursuant to a Contribution Agreement by and between the registrant and EastBridge Sub dated February 5, 2013 (the “Contribution Agreement”), the registrant contributed all assets and liabilities related to its consulting services business, to its newly formed subsidiary, EastBridge Investment Corp., from and after which it continued to conduct the consulting services business and operations of EastBridge at the subsidiary level.

 On February 6, 2013 (the “Effective Date”), the Parties executed all documents and filed the Plan of Merger with the registrar of the British Virgin Islands. Upon consummation of the Merger on the Effective Date, CBMG BVI shareholders were issued 3,638,932 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of EastBridge (the “EastBridge Common Stock”) constituting approximately 70% of the outstanding stock of EastBridge on a fully-diluted basis and the EastBridge stockholders retained 30% of the Company on a fully-diluted basis. Specifically, each of CBMG BVI’s ordinary shares (“CBMG Ordinary Shares”) was converted into the right to receive 0.020019 of a share of EastBridge Common Stock.
  
  Reorganization and Share Exchange
  
 Effective January 18, 2013, the Company completed its reincorporation from the State of Arizona to the State of Delaware (the “Reincorporation”). In connection with the Reincorporation, the Company exchanged every 100 shares of the Arizona entity for 1 share of the successor Delaware entity, with the same effect as a 1:100 reverse stock split, which became effective on January 31, 2013. All share and per share information in this Annual Report (including in the above paragraph), unless otherwise specified, reflects this reverse split.
 Recent Developments
  
 In January 2015, we initiated patient recruitment to support a phase II clinical study, in China, of ReJoin® human adipose derived mesenchymal progenitor cell (“haMPC”) therapy for Cartilage Damage (“CD”) resulting from osteoarthritis (“OA”) or sports injury. The study is based on the same science that has shown significant progress in the treatment of Knee Osteoarthritis (“KOA”). Both arthroscopy and the use of magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”) will be deployed to further demonstrate the regenerative efficacy of ReJoin® on CD.
  
  On February 4, 2015, the Company announced its agreement related to the acquisition of Chinese PLA General Hospital's ("PLAGH", Beijing, also known as "301 Hospital") Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cell (“CAR-T”) therapy, its recombinant expression vector CD19, CD20, CD30 and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor's (EGFR or HER1) Immuno-Oncology patents applications, and Phase I clinical data of the aforementioned therapies and manufacturing knowledge. The 301 Hospital team has conducted several preliminary clinical studies of various CAR-T constructs targeting CD19-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia, CD20-positive advanced B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, CD30-positive Hodgkin's lymphoma and EGFR-HER1-positive advanced lung cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer, and renal cell carcinoma. Pursuant to the terms of the Transfer Agreement, PLAGH agreed to transfer to the Company all of its right, title and interest in and to certain technologies currently owned by PLAGH (including, without limitation, four technologies and their pending patent applications) that relate to genetic engineering of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells and its applications (collectively, the “Technology”). In addition, PLAGH is responsible for obtaining governmental approval for the clinical trial related to the Technology.
  
 We announced interim Phase IIb trial results for our ReJoin® haMPC therapy for KOA on March 25, 2015, which confirmed that the primary and secondary endpoints of ReJoin™ therapy groups have all improved significantly compared to their baseline. We released positive 48-week follow-up data in January 2016.
  
  In January 2016, we launched a Phase I clinical trial of an off-the-shelf allogeneic haMPC AlloJoin™ therapy for KOA.
  
  On March 25, 2015, the Company announced results of the Phase I clinical studies on CAR-CD19 (CBM-C19.1) and CAR-CD20 (CBM-C20.1). The Phase I trial data showed an optimistic response rate under controllable toxicities.  In comparison with leading clinical research reports on CAR-CD19 therapies by peers, we believe that the efficacy profile of both CBM-C19.1 and CBM-C20.1 therapies are distinguished for the following reasons:
  
 
I. | The patient selection criteria of this study is highly selective. The participants enrolled in the studies were advanced, relapsed, and refractory to other standard-of-care therapies. This selection criterion is highly distinguishable from other studies, which avoided higher risk patients. Most of these high severity patients would not have been eligible for other entities’ studies because of extramedullary involvement or because the presence of bulky tumors were deemed too risky for their trials. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. | The treatment program design of this study is very stringent. 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | a. Our higher risk patients did not receive conditioning chemotherapy, which is known as a beneficial facilitator of adoptive T cell therapies. b. Moreover, our higher risk patients did not receive subsequent Hematopoietic Stem Cell transplantation (HSCT), which is also known as a beneficial facilitator of adoptive T cell therapies. 


 
  From April 2015, the Company commenced cooperation with agents/hospitals through which it started to provide immune-cell therapy technology consulting services to hospitals located in Beijing, Shandong, Anhui and Shanghai. The Company subsequently decided not to focus on the cell therapy technology service section and accordingly ceased its cooperation with Jihua Hospital and several agents. For the year ended December 31, 2016, revenue of $0.6 million was derived from this service.
  
  On May 27, 2015, the Company announced the appointment of Richard L. Wang, Ph.D., MBA, PMP as Chief Operating Officer. Dr. Wang, a seasoned and accomplished scientist and industry professional, brings operational, project management, and R&D governance experience from multinational pharmaceutical companies, to support the Company’s research of osteoarthritis and oncology therapeutics. Dr. Wang oversees the Company’s research collaborations, technology transfers, drug development clinical trials, regulatory affairs, production, and oversight of the Company’s multicenter operations.
  
 At the 10th Annual World Stem Cells & Regenerative Medicine Congress in London, UK on May 21, 2015, the Company announced results of the Phase I clinical studies of CD30-directed CAR-T therapy on CD30-positive Stage III and IV Hodgkin's lymphoma patients. The results of this trial demonstrated that five out of seven patients responded to the treatment, and the therapy was demonstrated in this trial to be safe, feasible and efficacious.
  
  On June 26, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Blackbird BioFinance, LLC (“Blackbird”)’s license from University of South Florida (“USF”) on the next generation cancer immunotherapy vaccine CD40LGVAX, its related technologies and technical knowledge.  Of the total consideration to be delivered to Blackbird for the purchased assets, $2,500,000 was delivered in cash and 28,120 shares of Company common stock (the "Closing Shares"), representing $1,050,000 of the purchase consideration (based on the 20-day volume-weighted average price of the Company’s stock on the closing date), was issued and delivered to Blackbird. Another 18,747 shares (the “Holdback Shares”), representing $700,000 of the purchase consideration (based on the 20-day volume-weighted average price of the Company’s stock on the closing date), was issued and delivered to Blackbird in November 2015.  Based on the terms of the license, we believe the Company will pay potentially more than $25 million in future milestones and royalty payments.
  
 We believe this technological addition may address meaningful and sizable unmet medical needs. Based on the latest data available from NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (“NSCLC”) (Version 4. 2014), an estimated 224,210 people in the United States were diagnosed with lung cancer in 2014, with an estimated 159,260 deaths occurring because of the disease. In China, 728,552 individuals were diagnosed with lung cancer in 2012, and 592,410 individuals in China died of lung cancer in 2012 (source: Chinese Cancer Registry Annual Report 2012 & GMCD40L Study Synopsis).
  
 Despite the advances of targeted therapies and recent breakthroughs with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD1 or PDL1 monoclonal antibody treatments, there are still significant unmet medical needs in NSCLC, and the disease remains largely incurable. We believe the CD40LGVAX vaccine, in combination with an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody, may provide synergistic and improved clinical benefits in both PDL1 positive and negative patients. We previously anticipated a phase I/II clinical trial for the CD40LGVAX vaccine combined with PD-1 antibody to commence in the second half of 2015.  We are currently evaluating both U.S. and non-U.S. options for furthering clinical trials for the CD40LGVAX vaccine following Moffitt Cancer Center’s notification to us that it will not be continuing its sponsorship of the U.S. CD40LGVAX Trial. In the third quarter of 2015, we reviewed and modified the design of CD40LGVAX trial by expanding the number of patient recruitment, changing from single site to multi-sites trial and adding stratification to the trial.  We are converting the CD40LGVAX Investigator Sponsor Research (“ISR”) to a CBMG IND trial.

  On June 26, 2015, the Russell Investments Group reconstituted its comprehensive set of U.S. indexes, the Company was selected to be included in the broad-market Russell 3000® Index.  The Russell 3000® Index encompasses the 3,000 largest U.S.-traded stocks by objective, market-capitalization rankings and style attributes. This weighted index by market capitalization was constructed to provide a comprehensive barometer of the broad market and it now represents approximately 98% of the investable U.S. equity market. Membership in this index, which remains in place for one year, means automatic inclusion in the small-cap Russell 2000® Index as well as the appropriate growth and value style indexes.  Russell indexes are widely used by investment managers and institutional investors for index funds and as benchmarks for active investment strategies.
  
 In July 2015, the Company has received two new certifications from the China Food and Drug Administration (the “CFDA”) for its proprietary cell and tissue preservation media kits, in accordance with the CFDA’s new regulations announced on June 1, 2015. These certified kits enable long-term preservation and long distance shipment of cells and tissue, without freezing them down, from and to the point of care for ready applications by physicians. The latest certifications further strengthen our Vertically Integrated Cell Manufacturing System (VICMS) to centralize the processing and supplying of autologous cell therapies, and reinforce our potential to be a world-class biotechnology company, serving large unmet medical needs.
  
 On August 26, 2015 the Company filed new patents - “Preparation of HER1 chimeric antigen receptor and NKT cells and application” for China patent and PCT and “Preparation of CD19 chimeric antigen receptor and NKT cells and application” for China patent.
  
 On September 26, 2015, the Company presented at the 2015 European Cancer Congress’ (“ECCO”) annual meeting held in Vienna, Austria results from the first 11 NSCLC patients in the trial outlined in the abstract, entitled Chimeric Antigen Receptor-Modified T-Cells for the Immunotherapy of Patients with HER-1 Expressing Advanced Relapsed/Refractory Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
  
 On September 28, 2015, the Company announced results of the Phase I clinical studies of CAR-T EGFR-HER1 (“CBM-EGFR.1”) for the treatment of patients with EGFR expressing advanced relapsed/refractory solid tumors. Based on the results from 24 patients treated with CBM-EGFR.1 (17 patients with non-small cell lung cancer, 5 patients with cholangiocarcinoma, 1 patient with pancreatic cancer and 1 patient with renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”)), the early results showed that CBM-EGFR.1 immunotherapy was safe, well tolerated, and had positive signal of clinical activity in several indications. The data was selected for a late-breaking oral presentation entitled EGFR-Targeted Chimeric Antigen Receptor-Modified T Cells Immunotherapy for Patients With EGFR-Expressing Advanced or Relapsed/Refractory Solid Tumors at the 5th World Congress on Cancer Therapy in Atlanta, Georgia.  Highlight of Phase I/II clinical trial for CBMG CAR-T products in multiple advanced, refractory/relapsing solid tumors is as follow:
  
 
● | First known report of positive safety and signal of clinical activity of EGFR CAR-T in multiple solid tumor indications,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Most NSCLC patients treated with CBM-EGFR.1 failed EGFR-TKI therapy prior to CBM-EGFR.1 treatment,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Overall disease control rate (DCR) is 79% (19 of 24). 100% DCR in cholangiocarcinoma (5/5), 71% DCR in NSCLC (12/17),
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Objective response rate (ORR) of 25% in combined indications: 2 complete response (CR) and 1 partial response (PR) in cholangiocarcinoma, 2 PR in NSCLC and 1 PR in pancreatic cancer.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
  The September 2015 reports on CBM-EGFR.1 therapy for late stage solid tumors have demonstrated our ability to innovate, advance boundaries between basic research and translational medicine and streamline the production of CAR-T and clinical treatment.  With the talent addition of our COO and CSO, and the maturing of working relationship with PLAGH cancer immune cell therapy resources, we plan to evaluate and prioritize our cancer clinical trial indications for commercialization using safe and most effective therapy or combination therapies. The Company believes that, when integrated with CBMG's state-of-the-art infrastructure and clinical platform, the aforementioned acquired AG, 301 Hospital and USF technologies will improve our cancer immune cell therapies clinical pathway and pave the way for collaboration with renowned institutions. We plan to initiate certain cancer clinical trials upon receiving acceptance of the clinical trial designs with principal investigators and obtaining the requisite approvals.

  For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we generated $0.6 million, $2.5 million and $0.6 million in revenue, respectively. The revenue since July 2014 is all from our technology consulting service. Before July 2014, our revenue was mainly from sales of A-Stromal™ enzyme reagent kits. We expect our biopharmaceutical business to generate revenues primarily from immune therapy and the development of therapies for the treatment of KOA in the next three to four years.
  
  Our operating expenses for year ended December 31, 2016 were in line with management’s plans and expectations. We incurred an increase in total operating expenses of approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, which is primarily attributable to an increase in professional service costs and increased input into expenditures for R&D projects.

On the same day, WFOE, CBMG Shanghai, Cao Wei and Chen Mingzhe entered into a termination agreement, pursuant to which, the series of VIE agreements executed among the WFOE, CBMG Shanghai, Chen Mingzhe and Cao Wei were terminated and a new set of VIE agreements were executed. The following is a description of each of these VIE agreements:
  
  Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement.   Through the WFOE, we are a party to an exclusive business cooperation agreement dated October 26, 2016 with CBMG Shanghai, which provides that (i) the WFOE shall exclusively provide CBMG Shanghai with complete technical support, business support and related consulting services; (ii) without prior written consent of the WFOE, CBMG Shanghai may not accept the same or similar consultancy and/or services from any third party, nor establish any similar cooperation relationship with any third party regarding same matters during the term of the agreement; (iii) CBMG Shanghai shall pay the WFOE service fees as calculated based on the time of service rendered by the WFOE multiplying the corresponding rate, plus an adjusted amount decided by the board of the WFOE; and (iv) CBMG Shanghai grants to the WFOE an irrevocable and exclusive option to purchase, at its sole discretion, any or all of CBMG Shanghai’s assets at the lowest purchase price permissible under PRC laws.  The term of the agreement is 10 years, provided however the agreement may extended at the option of the WFOE. Since this agreement permits the WFOE to determine the service fee at its sole discretion, the agreement in effect provides the WFOE with rights to all earnings of the VIE.

  Exclusive Option Agreement with Chen Mingzhe.  Through the WFOE, we are a party to an exclusive option agreement with CBMG Shanghai and Chen Mingzhe dated October 26, 2016, under which: (i) Chen Mingzhe irrevocably granted the WFOE an irrevocable and exclusive right to purchase, or designate another person to purchase the entire equity interest in CBMG Shanghai for an aggregate purchase price to be determined; and (ii) any proceeds obtained by Chen Mingzhe through the above equity transfer in CBMG Shanghai shall be used for the payment of the loan provided by the WFOE under the aforementioned Loan Agreement.
  
  Power of Attorney from Lu Junfeng.  Through the WFOE we are the recipient of a power of attorney executed by Lu Junfeng on October 26, 2016, in accordance with which Lu Junfeng authorized the WFOE to act on his behalf as his exclusive agent with respect to all matters concerning his equity interest in CBMG Shanghai, including without limitation to attending the shareholder meetings of CBMG Shanghai, exercising voting rights and designating and appointing senior executives of CBMG Shanghai.
  
  Power of Attorney from Chen Mingzhe.  Through the WFOE we are the recipient of a power of attorney executed by Chen Mingzhe on October 26, 2016, in accordance with which Chen Mingzhe authorized the WFOE to act on his behalf as his exclusive agent with respect to all matters concerning his equity interest in CBMG Shanghai, including without limitation to attending the shareholders meetings of CBMG Shanghai, exercising voting rights and designating and appointing senior executives of CBMG Shanghai.
  
  Equity Interest Pledge Agreement with Lu Junfeng.  Through the WFOE, we are a party to an equity interest pledge agreement with CBMG Shanghai and Lu Junfeng dated October 26, 2016, in accordance with which: (i) Lu Junfeng pledged to the WFOE the entire equity interest he holds in CBMG Shanghai as security for payment of the consulting and service fees by CBMG Shanghai under the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement; (ii) Lu Junfeng and CBMG Shanghai submitted all necessary documents to ensure the registration of the Pledge of the Equity Interest with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”), and the pledge became effective on November 22, 2016; (iii) on the occurrence of any event of default, unless it has been successfully resolved within 20 days after the delivery of a rectification notice by the WFOE, the WFOE may exercise its pledge rights at any time by a written notice to Lu Junfeng.
  
  Equity Interest Pledge Agreement with Chen Mingzhe.   Through the WFOE we are a party to an equity interest pledge agreement with CBMG Shanghai and Chen Mingzhe dated October 26, 2016, in accordance with which: (i) Chen Mingzhe pledged to the WFOE the entire equity interest he holds in CBMG Shanghai as security for payment of the consulting and service fees by CBMG Shanghai under the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement; (ii) Chen Mingzhe and CBMG Shanghai submitted all necessary documents to ensure the registration of the Pledge of the Equity Interest with SAIC, and the pledge became effective on November 22, 2016; (iii) on the occurrence of any event of default, unless it has been successfully resolved within 20 days after the delivery of a rectification notice by the WFOE, the WFOE may exercise its pledge rights at any time by a written notice to Chen Mingzhe. 
  
 Our relationship with our controlled VIE entity, CBMG Shanghai, through the VIE agreements, is subject to various operational and legal risks.  Management believes the Mr. Chen and Mr. Lu as record holders of the VIE’s registered capital have no interest in acting contrary to the VIE agreements.  However, if Mr. Chen and Lu as shareholders of the VIE entity were to reduce or eliminate their ownership of the registered capital of the VIE entity, their interests may diverge from that of CBMG and they may seek to act in a manner contrary to the VIE agreements (for example by controlling the VIE entity in such a way that is inconsistent with the directives of CBMG management and the board; or causing non-payment by the VIE entity of services fees).  If such circumstances were to occur the WFOE would have to assert control rights through the powers of attorney and other VIE agreements, which would require legal action through the PRC judicial system.  While we believe the VIE agreements are legally enforceable in the PRC, there is a risk that enforcement of these agreements may involve more extensive procedures and costs to enforce, in comparison to direct equity ownership of the VIE entity.  We believe based on the advice of local counsel that the VIE agreements are valid and in compliance with PRC laws presently in effect.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the applicable PRC laws were to change or are interpreted by authorities in the future in a manner which challenges or renders the VIE agreements ineffective, the WFOE’s ability to control and obtain all benefits (economic or otherwise) of ownership of the VIE entity could be impaired or eliminated.   In the event of such future changes or new interpretations of PRC law, in an effort to substantially preserve our rights we may have to either amend our VIE agreements or enter into alternative arrangements which comply with PRC laws as interpreted and then in effect.

 For further discussion of risks associated with the above, please see the section below titled “Risks Related to Our Structure.”
  
  BIOPHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS
  
 Our biopharmaceutical business was founded in 2009 as a newly formed specialty biomedicine company by a team of seasoned Chinese-American executives, scientists and doctors. In 2010, we established a facility designed and built to GMP standards in Wuxi, and in 2012 we established a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) GMP standard protocol-compliant manufacturing facility in Shanghai. In October 2015, we opened a facility designed and built to GMP standards in Beijing. Our focus has been to serve the rapidly growing health care market in China by marketing and commercializing stem cell and immune cell therapeutics, related tools and products from our patent-protected homegrown and acquired cell technology, as well as by utilizing exclusively in-licensed and other acquired intellectual properties.
  
 Our current treatment focal points are cancer and other degenerative diseases such as KOA.
  
  Cancer. In the cancer field, with the recent build-up of multiple cancer therapeutic technologies, we have prioritized our clinical efforts on CAR-T, technologies, Vaccine, Tcm and TCR clonality technologies, and are not actively pursuing the fragmented Tcm technical services opportunities. We are integrating CBMG's state-of-the art infrastructure and clinical platform with the technologies platform to boost the Company's immuno-oncology presence and pave the way for future partnerships. We plan to initiate certain cancer clinical trials in China upon receiving acceptance of the clinical trial designs with the principal investigator and obtaining the requisite regulatory approval. On November 29, 2016,we announced the approval and commencement of patient enrollment in China for its CARD-1 (“CAR-T Against DLBCL”) Phase I clinical trial utilizing its optimized proprietary C-CAR011 construct of CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy for the treatment of patients with refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). The CARD-1 trial has begun enrollment with final data expected to be available in the second half of 2017. On January 9, 2017 we announced the approval and commencement of patient enrollment in China for its CALL-1 (“CAR-T against Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia”) Phase I clinical trial utilizing its optimized proprietary C-CAR011 construct of CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (“CAR-T”) therapy for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) CD19+ B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (“ALL”). The CALL-1 trial has begun enrollment with final data expected to be available at the end of 2017. Depending on the Phase I CARD-1 and CALL-1 results, we expect to initiate larger Phase II clinical trials as soon as practicable.
  
  KOA.  In 2013, we completed a Phase I/IIa clinical study, in China, for our Knee Osteoarthritis (“KOA”) therapy named ReJoin®. The trial tested the safety and efficacy of intra-articular injections of autologous haMPCs in order to reduce inflammation and repair damaged joint cartilage. The 6-month follow-up clinical data showed ReJoin® therapy to be both safe and effective.
  
 In Q2 of 2014, we completed patient enrollment for the Phase IIb clinical trial of ReJoin® for KOA. The multi-center study enrolled 53 patients to participate in a randomized, single blind trial. We published 48 weeks follow-up data of Phase I/IIa on December 5, 2014.  The 48 weeks data indicated that patients have reported a decrease in pain and a significant improvement in mobility and flexibility, while the clinical data shows our ReJoin® regenerative medicine treatment to be safe.   We announced interim 24 week results for ReJoin® on March 25, 2015 and  released positive Phase IIb 48 week follow-up data in January 2016, which shows the primary and secondary endpoints of ReJoin® therapy group having all improved significantly compared to their baseline, which has confirmed some of the Company’s Phase I/IIa results. Our ReJoin® human adipose-derived mesenchymal progenitor cell (haMPC) therapy for KOA is an interventional therapy using proprietary device, process, culture and medium:
   
   ●
 Obtain  adipose (fat) tissue from the patient using our CFDA approved medical device, the A-Stromal™ Kit;

   ●
 Expand haMPCs using our proprietary culture medium (serum-free and antibiotics-free); and

   ●
 Formulated for ReJoin therapy using our proprietary formulation.

 
  
14


 
 
 Our process is distinguishable from sole Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) therapy. The immunophenotype of our haMPCs exhibited multiple biomarkers such as CD29+, CD73+, CD90+, CD49d+, HLA-I+, HLA-DR-, Actin-, CD14-, CD34-, and CD45-.  In contrast, SVF is merely a heterogeneous fraction including preadipocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, and adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs).
   
 In January 2016, we launched the Allogeneic KOA Phase I Trial in China to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AlloJoin™, an off-the shelf allogeneic adipose derived progenitor cell (haMPC) therapy for the treatment of KOA. On August 5, 2016 we completed patient treatment for the Allogeneic KOA Phase I trial, and on December 9, 2016 we announced interim 3-month safety data from the Allogenic KOA Phase I Trial in China. The interim analysis of the trial has preliminarily demonstrated a safety and tolerability profile of AlloJoin™ in the three doses tested, and no serious adverse events (SAE) have been observed. The trial is on schedule to be completed by the third quarter of 2017.
  
 In January 2015, we initiated patient recruitment in a phase II clinical study, in China, of ReJoin (human adipose derived mesenchymal progenitor cell or “haMPC”) in Cartilage Damaged (“CD”) patients resulting from osteoarthritis (“OA”) or sports injury, in further support of KOA indication. The study is based on the same technology that has shown significant efficacy in the treatment of Knee Osteoarthritis (“KOA”), but requires two arthroscopic examinations and the use of magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”) to further demonstrate the regenerative efficacy of ReJoin. Upon further review of the protocol and the difficulty of getting patients back for a second arthroscopic examination , we determined to terminate the study.
  
 The  unique lines of adult adipose-derived stem cells and the immune cell therapies enable us to create multiple cell formulations in treating specific medical conditions and diseases, as well as applying single cell types in a specific treatment protocol. Management believes that our adult adipose-derived line will become commercially viable and market-ready in China within three to four years. In addition, we plan to assess and initiate cancer clinical trials leading to commercialization using safe and most effective therapy or combination therapies. The quality management systems of CBMG Shanghai and CBMG Wuxi were issued a Certificate of ISO-9001:2008 by SGS /ANAB (ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board). Our facility in Shanghai was issued a Certificate of Compliance by ENV Services, Inc., and ISO Inspection Service Provider that (i) its rooms 1-7, 10 are certified to ISO Class 7 per ISO-14644 in accordance with cGMP; (ii) its biological safety cabinets are certified per NSF/ANSI 49 and to ISO Class 5;and (iii) its instrumentation calibration has been certified to perform in accordance with ANS/NCSL Z-540-1 and document in accordance with 10CFR21.Our facility in Shanghai was issued a Testing Report by Shanghai Food and Drug Packaging Material Control Center concluding that some testing items of the cleanrooms are in compliance with the Good Manufacturing Practice for Drugs (2010 Revision) of China. The cleanrooms in Beijing are certified to meet the standard of CNAS L1669; and Wuxi has been certified to meet the CNAS L0221 standard.
  
 In addition to standard protocols, we use proprietary processes and procedures for manufacturing our cell lines, comprised of:
  
 
● | Banking processes that ensure cell preservation and viability;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------
● | DNA identification for stem cell ownership; and 
● | Bio-safety testing at independently certified laboratories. 

 Regenerative Medicine and Cell Therapy
  
 Regenerative medicine is the “process of replacing or regenerating human cells, tissues or organs to restore or establish normal function”. Cell therapy as applied to regenerative medicine holds the promise of regenerating damaged tissues and organs in the body by rejuvenating damaged tissue and by stimulating the body’s own repair mechanisms to heal previously irreparable tissues and organs. Medical cell therapies are classified into two types: allogeneic (cells from a third-party donor) or autologous (cells from one’s own body), with each offering its own distinct advantages. Allogeneic cells are beneficial when the patient’s own cells, whether due to disease or degeneration, are not as viable as those from a healthy donor. Similarly, in cases such as cancer, where the disease is so unique to the individual, autologous cells can offer true personalized medicine.
  
  
15


 
 
 Regenerative medicine can be categorized into major subfields as follows:
  
 
● | Cell Therapy. Cell therapy involves the use of cells, whether derived from adults, third party donors or patients, from various parts of the body, for the treatment of diseases or injuries. Therapeutic applications may include cancer vaccines, cell based immune-therapy, arthritis, heart disease, diabetes, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, vision impairments, orthopedic diseases and brain or spinal cord injuries. This subfield also includes the development of growth factors and serums and natural reagents that promote and guide cell development.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tissue Engineering. This subfield involves using a combination of cells with biomaterials (also called “scaffolds”) to generate partially or fully functional tissues and organs, or using a mixture of technology in a bioprinting process. Some natural materials, like collagen, can be used as biomaterial, but advances in materials science have resulted in a variety of synthetic polymers with attributes that would make them uniquely attractive for certain applications. Therapeutic applications may include heart patch, bone re-growth, wound repair, replacement neo-urinary conduits, saphenous arterial grafts, inter-vertebral disc and spinal cord repair.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Diagnostics and Lab Services. This subfield involves the production and derivation of cell lines that may be used for the development of drugs and treatments for diseases or genetic defects. This sector also includes companies developing devices that are designed and optimized for regenerative medicine techniques, such as specialized catheters for the delivery of cells, tools for the extraction of stem cells and cell-based diagnostic tools.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
 All living complex organisms start as a single cell that replicates, differentiates (matures) and perpetuates in an adult through its lifetime. Cell therapy is aimed at tapping into the power of cells to prevent and treat disease, regenerate damaged or aged tissue and provide cosmetic applications. The most common type of cell therapy has been the replacement of mature, functioning cells such as through blood and platelet transfusions. Since the 1970s, bone marrow and then blood and umbilical cord-derived stem cells have been used to restore bone marrow and blood and immune system cells damaged by chemotherapy and radiation used to treat many cancers. These types of cell therapies have been approved for use world-wide and are typically reimbursed by insurance.
  
 Over the past number of years, cell therapies have been in clinical development to attempt to treat an array of human diseases. The use of autologous (self-derived) cells to create vaccines directed against tumor cells in the body has been demonstrated to be effective and safe in clinical trials. Researchers around the globe are evaluating the effectiveness of cell therapy as a form of replacement or regeneration of cells for the treatment of numerous organ diseases or injuries, including those of the brain and spinal cord. Cell therapies are also being evaluated for safety and effectiveness to treat heart disease, autoimmune diseases such as diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, joint diseases and cancerous diseases. While no assurances can be given regarding future medical developments, we believe that the field of cell therapy is a subset of biotechnology that holds promise to improve human health, help eliminate disease and minimize or ameliorate the pain and suffering from many common degenerative diseases relating to aging.
  
  Recent Developments in Cancer Cell Therapy
  
 According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute’s 2013 cancer topics research update on CAR-T-Cells, excitement is growing for immunotherapy—therapies that harness the power of a patient’s immune system to combat their disease, or what some in the research community are calling the “fifth pillar” of cancer treatment.
  
 One approach to immunotherapy involves engineering patients’ own immune cells to recognize and attack their tumors. And although this approach, called adoptive cell transfer ("ACT"), has been restricted to small clinical trials so far, treatments using these engineered immune cells have generated some remarkable responses in patients with advanced cancer. For example, in several early-stage trials testing ACT in patients with advanced acute lymphoblastic leukemia ("ALL") who had few if any remaining treatment options, many patients’ cancers have disappeared entirely. Several of these patients have remained cancer free for extended periods.
  
  
16


 
 
 Equally promising results have been reported in several small clinical trials involving patients with lymphoma. Although the lead investigators cautioned that much more research is needed, the results from the trials performed thus far indicate that researchers can successfully alter patients’ T cells so that they attack their cancer cells.  As an example, we look to Spectrum Pharmaceutical’s Folotyn approved in September 2009 for treatment of R/R peripheral T-cell lymphoma with approval supported by a single arm trial observing an overall response rate of 27% and median duration of response of 9.4 months. In addition, CTI Therapeutics Pixuvri received a complete response letter in April 2010 in R/R aggressive NHL in which a 37% overall response rate and 5.5 month duration of response was observed.
  
 ACT’s building blocks are T cells, a type of immune cell collected from the patient’s own blood. After collection, the T cells are genetically engineered to produce special receptors on their surface called chimeric antigen receptors ("CARs"). CARs are proteins that allow the T cells to recognize a specific protein (antigen) on tumor cells. These engineered CAR T cells are then grown in the laboratory until they number in the billions. The expanded population of CAR T cells is then infused into the patient. After the infusion, if all goes as planned, the T cells multiply in the patient’s body and, with guidance from their engineered receptor, recognize and kill cancer cells that harbor the antigen on their surfaces. This process builds on a similar form of ACT pioneered from NCI’s Surgery Branch for patients with advanced melanoma. According to www.cancer.gov/.../research-updates/2013/CAR-T-Cells, in 2013 NCI’s Pediatric Oncology Branch commented that the CAR T cells are much more potent than anything they can achieve with other immune-based treatments being studied. Although investigators working in this field caution that there is still much to learn about CAR T-cell therapy, the early results from trials like these have generated considerable optimism. Researchers opined that CAR T-cell therapy eventually may become a standard therapy for some B-cell malignancies like ALL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
  
 The traditional cancer treatment includes surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. In the last decade, we witnessed a boom in targeted therapies including monoclonal antibody and small molecule therapies, such as Iressa and Tarciva that targets EGFR activating mutations in the NSCLC, Herceptin that treats breast cancer patients with HER2 overexpression, Crizotinib that targets NSCLC patients with positive ALK fusion gene.
  
 So far, chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (“CAR-T”) such as CD19 CAR-T, have been tested in several hematological indications on patients that are refractory/relapsing to chemotherapy, and many of them have relapsed after stem cell transplantation.  All of these patients had very limited treatment option prior to CAR-T therapy.  CAR-T has shown positive clinical efficacy in many of these patients. Some of have them lived for years post CAR-T treatment.
  
 On July 2016, Juno Therapeutics, Inc. reported the death of patients enrolled in the U.S. Phase II clinical trial of JCAR015 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The US FDA put the trial on hold and lifted the hold within a week after Juno provided satisfactory explanation and solution. Juno believes that the patient deaths were caused by the use of Fludarabine preconditioning and they will use only cyclophosphamide pre-conditioning in the future enrollment. The trial was halted in November of 2016 after two more deaths occurred after the trial resumed. The Company believes that its product and study are distinguishable from Juno Therapeutics and plans to continue to monitor any toxicities associated with the study.
  
  Market for Cell-Based Therapies
  
 In 2013, U.S. sales of products which contain stem cells or progenitor cells or which are used to concentrate autologous blood, bone marrow or adipose tissues to yield concentrations of stem cells for therapeutic use were, conservatively, valued at $236 million at the hospital level. It is estimated that the orthopedics industry used approximately 92% of the stem cell products.
  
 The forecast is that in the United States, shipments of treatments with stem cells or instruments which concentrate stem cell preparations for injection into painful joints will fuel an overall increase in the use of stem cell based treatments and an increase to $5.7 billion in 2020, with key growth areas being Spinal Fusion, Sports Medicine and Osteoarthritis of the joints. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Prevalence of doctor-diagnosed arthritis and arthritis-attributable activity limitation United States. 2010-2012, Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disease that is characterized by degeneration of the articular cartilage, hyperosteogeny, and ultimately, joint destruction that can affect all of the joints. According to Dillon CF, Rasch EK, Gu Q et al. Prevalence of knee osteoarthritis in the United States: Arthritis Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1991-94. J Rheumatol. 2006, the incidence of OA is 50% among people over age 60 and 90% among people over age 65. KOA accounts for the majority of total OA conditions and in adults, OA is the second leading cause of work disability and the disability incidence is high (53%). The costs of OA management have grown exponentially over recent decades, accounting for up to 1% to 2.5% of the gross national product of countries with aging populations, including the U.S., Canada, the UK, France, and Australia. According to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS), the only pharmacologic therapies recommended for OA symptom management are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and tramadol (for patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis). Moreover, there is no approved disease modification therapy for OA in the world. Disease progression is a leading cause of hospitalization and ultimately requires joint replacement surgery. In 2009, the U.S. spent over $42 billion on replacement surgery for hip and knee joints alone. International regulatory guidelines on clinical investigation of medicinal products used in the treatment of OA were updated in 2015, and clinical benefits (or trial outcomes) of a disease modification therapy for KOA has been well defined and recommended. Medicinal products used in the treatment of osteoarthritis need to provide both a symptom relief effect for at least 6 months and a structure modification effect to slow cartilage degradation by at least 12 months. Symptom relief is generally measured by a composite questionnaire Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, and structure modification is measured by MRI, or radiographic image as accepted by international communities. The Company uses the WOMAC as primary end point to demonstrate symptom relief, and MRI to assess structure and regeneration benefits as a secondary endpoint.

 According to the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, there are 27 million Americans with Osteoarthritis (OA), and symptomatic Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) occurs in 13% of persons aged 60 and older. The International Journal of Rheumatic Diseases, 2011 reports that approximately 57 million people in China suffer from KOA. Currently no treatment exists that can effectively preserve knee joint cartilage or slow the progression of KOA. Current common drug-based methods of management, including anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), only relieve symptoms and carry the risk of side effects. Patients with KOA suffer from compromised mobility, leading to sedentary lifestyles; doubling the risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and obesity; and increasing the risk of all causes of mortality, colon cancer, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, lipid disorders, depression and anxiety. According to the Epidemiology of Rheumatic Disease (Silman AJ, Hochberg MC. Oxford Univ. Press, 1993:257), 53% of patients with KOA will eventually become disabled.
  
 The current data on CAR T-cell therapies, presented from various institutions including MSKCC, University of Pennsylvania, National Cancer Institute, and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Novartis and Kite Pharma, Inc have been very positive.   Novartis CAR-T technology has made breakthroughs in treating B cell lymphoma using genetically modified T cell technology. Both Kite and Novartis are on track to submit their respective CAR-T registration trial data to the US FDA for BLA in the near future.
  
 Approved cell therapies have been appearing on the market in recent years. In 2011, however, the industry was dealt two setbacks when Geron Corporation discontinued its embryonic program, and when Sanofi-Aventis acquired Genzyme Corporation and did not acquire the product rights relating to the allogeneic cell technology of Osiris Therapeutics, Inc., a partner of Genzyme and a leader in the field. In both cases there were difficulties navigating the U.S. regulatory requirements for product approval. Inadequate trial designs were cited in the executive summary of the 2012 New York Stem Cell Summit Report as contributing to these failures.
  
 The number of cell therapy companies that are currently in Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials has been gathering momentum, and we anticipate that new cellular therapy products will appear on the market within the next several years.
  
 Management believes the remaining risk in monetizing cancer immune cell therapies is concentrated in late stage clinical studies, speed-to-approval, manufacturing and process optimization.

  Our Strategy
  
 The majority of our biopharmaceutical business is in the development stage. We intend to concentrate our business on cell therapies and in the near-term, carrying our KOA stem cell therapy and cancer immune cell therapies to commercialization.
  
 We are developing our business in cell therapeutics and capitalizing on the increasing importance and promise that adult stem cells have in regenerative medicine. Our most advanced candidate involves adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells to treat KOA. Based on current estimates, we expect our biopharmaceutical business to generate revenues primarily through the development of therapies for the treatment of KOA within the next three to four years.
  
 Presently we have two KOA cell therapy clinical studies in China, a completed Phase IIb autologous study and an on-going Phase I allogeneic study. If and when either therapy obtains regulatory approval in the PRC, we will be able to market and offer the therapy for clinical use. Our focus is on the latest translational stages of product development, principally from the pre-clinical stage to regulatory approval and commercialization of new therapies.
  
 Our strategy is to develop safe and effective cellular medicine therapies for indications that represent a large unmet need in China, based on technologies developed both in-house and obtained through acquisition, licensing and collaboration arrangements with other companies. Our near term objective is to pursue successful clinical trials in China for our KOA application, followed by our CD and Asthma therapies.  We intend to utilize our comprehensive cell platform to support multiple cell lines to pursue multiple therapies, both allogeneic and autologous. We intend to apply U.S. Standard Operating Procedures ("SOPs") and protocols while complying with Chinese regulations, while owning, developing and executing our own clinical trial protocols. We plan to establish domestic and international joint ventures or partnerships to set up cell laboratories and/or research facilities, acquire technology or in-license technology from outside of China, and build affiliations with hospitals, to develop a commercialization path for our therapies, once approved. We intend to use our first-mover advantage in China, against a backdrop of enhanced regulation by the central government, to differentiate ourselves from the competition and establish a leading position in the China cell therapeutic market.  We also intend to out-license our technologies to interested parties and are exploring the feasibility of a U.S. allogeneic KOA clinical study with the FDA.
 
 CBMG initially plans to use its centralized manufacturing facility located in Shanghai to service multiple hospitals within 200 km of the facility.  We aim to complete clinical trials for our KOA therapy candidate as soon as practicable. Our goal is to first obtain regulatory permission for commercial use of the therapies for the respective hospitals in which the trials are being conducted. CBMG plans to scale up its customer base by qualifying multiple additional hospitals for the post-trial use of therapies, once approved, by following regulatory guidelines.  Based on current regulation and estimates we expect our biopharmaceutical business to generate revenues primarily from the development of therapies for the treatment of KOA within the next four to six years.
  
 With the AG acquisition we intend to monetize AG’s U.S. and Chinese intellectual property for immune cell therapy preparation methodologies and patient immunity assessment by engaging with prominent hospitals to conduct pre-clinical and clinical studies in specific cancer indications. The T Cell clonality analysis technology patent, together with AG’s other know-how for immunity analysis, will enable the Company to establish an immunoassay platform that is crucial for immunity evaluation of patients with immune disorders as well as cancerous diseases that are undergoing therapy.
  
 We believe that few competitors in China are as well-equipped as we are in the clinical trial development, diversified U.S. FDA protocol compliant manufacturing facilities, regulatory compliance and policy making participation, as well as a long-term presence in the U.S. with U.S.-based management and investor base.
  
 We intend to continue our business development efforts by adding other proven domestic and international biotechnology partners to monetize the China health care market.
  
 In order to expedite fulfillment of patient treatment CBMG has been actively developing technologies and products with a strong intellectual properties protection, including haMPC, derived from fat tissue, for the treatment of KOA and other indications. CBMG’s acquisition of AG provides an enlarged opportunity to expand the application of its cancer therapy-enabling technologies and to initiate clinical trials with leading cancer hospitals.  With the AG acquisition, we will continue to seek to empower hospitals' immune cell cancer therapy development programs that help patients improve their quality of life and improve their survival rate.

 CBMG's proprietary and patent-protected production processes and clinical protocols enable us to produce raw material, manufacture cells, and conduct cell banking and distribution. Applying our proprietary intellectual property, we will be able to customize specialize formulations to address complex diseases and debilitating conditions.
  
 CBMG has been developing disease-specific clinical treatment protocols. These protocols are designed for each of these proprietary cell lines to address patient-specific medical conditions. These protocols include medical assessment to qualify each patient for treatment, evaluation of each patient before and after a specific therapy, cell transplantation methodologies including dosage, frequency and the use of adjunct therapies, potential adverse effects and their proper management.
  
  The protocol of allogeneic haMPC therapy for KOA has been approved by Shanghai Renji Hospital’s Institutional Review Board for clinical studies. Once the studies are completed, the clinical data will be analyzed by qualified third party statisticians and reports will be published.
  
 We operate our manufacturing facilities under good manufacturing practice ("GMP") conditions in the ISO accredited laboratories standard. We employ an institutionalized and proprietary process and quality management system to optimize reproducibility and to hone our efficiency. Three facilities designed and built to GMP in Beijing, Shanghai and Wuxi, China meet international standards. In any precision setting, it is vital that all controlled-environment equipment meet certain design standards. To achieve this goal, our Shanghai cleanroom facility underwent rigorous cleanroom certification. Our facility in Shanghai was issued a Certificate of Compliance by ENV Services, Inc., and ISO Inspection Service Provider that (i) its rooms 1-7, 10 are certified to ISO Class 7 per ISO-14644 in accordance with cGMP; (ii) its biological safety cabinets are certified per NSF/ANSI 49 and to ISO Class 5; and (iii) its instrumentation calibration has been certified to perform in accordance with ANS/NCSL Z-540-1 and document in accordance with 10CFR21. The cleanrooms in Beijing are certified to meet the standard of CNAS L1669; and Wuxi has been certified to meet the CNAS L0221 standard. With our integrated Plasmid, Viral Vectors, and CAR-T cells Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls process as well as planned capacity expansion, we are highly distinguishable with other companies in the cellular medicine space.
  
 In total, our cGMP facilities have over 47,300 sq. ft. of space with the capacity for 19 independent cell production lines. We are expanding our GMP facilities to approximately 70,000 sq. ft. of space and aim to be able to treat approximately 10,000 cancer patients and 10,000 patients per year by the end of 2017.
  
 Most importantly, our most experienced team members have more than 20 years of relevant experience in China, European Union, and the United States. All of these factors make CBMG a high quality cell products manufacturer in China.
  
  Our Targeted Indications and Potential Therapies
  
  Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA)
  
 We are currently pursuing two primary therapies for the treatment of KOA: our ReJoin ® therapy and our AlloJoinTM therapy.
  
 We completed the Phase I/IIa clinical trial for the treatment of KOA. The trial tested the safety and efficacy of intra-articular injections of autologous haMPCs in order to reduce inflammation and repair damaged joint cartilage. The 6-month follow-up clinical data showed ReJoinTM therapy to be both safe and effective.
  
 In the second quarter of 2014, we completed patient enrollment for the Phase IIb clinical trial of ReJoin® for KOA. The multi-center study has enrolled 53 patients to participate in a randomized, single blind trial. We published 48 weeks follow-up data of Phase I/IIa on December 5, 2014.  The 48 weeks data indicated that patients have reported a decrease in pain and a significant improvement in mobility and flexibility, while the clinical data shows our ReJoin® regenerative medicine treatment to be safe. We announced positive Phase IIb 48-week follow-up data in January 2016, with statistical significant evidence that ReJoin® enhanced cartilage regeneration, which concluded the planned phase IIb trial.

 In January 2016, we launched the Allogeneic KOA Phase I Trial in China to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AlloJoin™, an off-the shelf allogeneic adipose derived progenitor cell (haMPC) therapy for the treatment of KOA. On August 5, 2016 we completed patient treatment for the Allogeneic KOA Phase I trial. On August 5, 2016 we completed patient treatment for the Allogenic KOA Phase I Trial, and on December 9, 2016, we announced interim 3-month safety data from the Allogenic KOA Phase I Trial in China. The interim analysis of the trial has preliminarily demonstrated a safety and tolerability profile of AlloJoin™ in the three doses tested, and no serious adverse events (SAE) have been observed. The trial is on schedule to be completed by the third quarter of 2017.
  
 Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease of the joints. KOA is one of the most common types of osteoarthritis. Pathological manifestation of osteoarthritis is primarily local inflammation caused by immune response and subsequent damage of joints. Restoration of immune response and joint tissues are the objective of therapies.
  
 According to International Journal of Rheumatic Diseases, 2011, 53% of KOA patients will degenerate to the point of disability. Conventional treatment usually involves invasive surgery with painful recovery and physical therapy. As drug-based methods of management are ineffective, the same journal estimates that some 1.5 million patients with this disability will degenerate to the point of requiring artificial joint replacement surgery every year. However, only 40,000 patients will actually be able to undergo replacement surgery, leaving the majority of patients to suffer from a life-long disability due to lack of effective treatment.
  
 haMPCs are currently being considered as a new and effective treatment for osteoarthritis, with a huge potential market.  Osteoarthritis is one of the ten most disabling diseases in developed countries. Worldwide estimates are that 9.6% of men and 18.0% of women aged over 60 years have symptomatic osteoarthritis. It is estimated that the global OA therapeutics market was worth $4.4 billion in 2010 and is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 3.8% to reach $5.9 billion by 2018.
 
 In order to bring haMPC-based KOA therapy to market, our market strategy is to: (a) establish regional laboratories that comply with cGMP standards in Shanghai and Beijing that meet Chinese regulatory approval; and (b) file joint applications with Class AAA hospitals to use haMPCs to treat KOA in a clinical trial setting.
  
 Our competitors are pursuing treatments for osteoarthritis with knee cartilage implants.  However, unlike their approach, our KOA therapy is not surgically invasive – it uses a small amount (30ml) of adipose tissue obtained via liposuction from the patient, which is cultured and re-injected into the patient. The injections are designed to induce the body’s secretion of growth factors promoting immune response and regulation, and regrowth of cartilage. The down-regulation of the patient’s immune response is aimed at reducing and controlling inflammation which is a central cause of KOA.
  
 We believe our proprietary method, subsequent haMPC proliferation and processing know-how will enable haMPC therapy to be a low cost and relatively safe and effective treatment for KOA. Additionally, banked haMPCs can continue to be stored for additional use in the future.
  
  Immuno-oncology (I/o)
  
 We continue to fortify our cancer breakthrough technology platform with I/o, programmed cell death and vaccine technology.
  
 Our CAR-T platform is built on well-studied lenti-virial vector and second-generation CAR design, which is used by most of the current trials and studies. We rigorously select the patient population for each asset and indication to allow the optimal path forward for regulatory approval. We also fully integrate the state of art translational medicine effort into each clinical study to aid in dose selection, to confirm the mechanism of action and proof of concept, and to identify the optimal targeting patient population whenever appropriate. We plan to continue to grow our translational medicine team and engage key opinion leaders to meet the demand.

 Because there are many differences between hematological and solid tumors, drug penetration or infiltration into solid tumors sites is more challenging than hematological cancer. Antibody dependent cell-mediated (“ADCC”) toxicity works much better in hematological cancers. Hematological cancers usually carry fewest mutations among all cancers and are usually less molecularly heterogeneous than that of solid tumors.  As such, routinely hematological cancers respond better to therapeutic interventions, there are more complete, as well as partial responses.  And the duration of response is usually longer.
  
 Solid tumors pose more challenges than hematological cancers.  The patients are more heterogeneous, making it difficult to have one drug to work effectively in the majority of the patients in any cancer indication.  The duration of response is most likely shorter and patients are likely to relapse even after initial positive clinical response.  We believe that CAR-T therapy can successfully treat hematopoietic cancers because the therapy can deplete all B cells or T cells including normal and cancer cells in leukemia and lymphoma. When the stem cells are not targeted these stem cells can regenerate normal B and T cells. In contrast, effective tumor specific antigens found to be less to target in solid tumors.  When the drugs kill tumor cells, they also kill the normal cells to a certain degree, leading to different degrees of toxicity.  We will continue to make an effort to develop CAR-T or other cell based therapies to target solid tumors.
  
  Human Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Progenitor Cells (haMPC)
  
 Adult mesenchymal stem cells can currently be isolated from a variety of adult human sources, such as liver, bone marrow, and adipose (fat) tissue. We believe the advantages in using adipose tissue (as opposed to bone marrow or blood) are that it is one of the richest sources of pluripotent cells in the body, the easy and repeatable access to fat via liposuction, and the simple cell isolation procedures that can begin to take place even on-site with minor equipment needs. The procedure we are testing for KOA involves extracting a very small amount of fat using a minimally invasive extraction process which takes up to 20 minutes, and leaves no scarring. The haMPC cells are then processed and isolated on site, and injected intra articularly into the knee joint with ultrasound guidance.
 
 These haMPC cells are capable of differentiating into bone, cartilage, tendon, skeletal muscle, and fat under the right conditions. As such, haMPCs are an attractive focus for medical research and clinical development. Importantly, we believe both allogeneic and autologously sourced haMPCs may be used in the treatment of disease. Numerous studies have provided preclinical data that support the safety and efficacy of allogeneic and autologously derived haMPC, offering a choice for those where factors such as donor age and health are an issue.
  
 Additionally, certain disease treatment plans call for an initial infusion of these cells in the form of SVF, an initial form of cell isolation that can be completed and injected within ninety minutes of receiving lipoaspirate. The therapeutic potential conferred by the cocktail of ingredients present in the SVF is also evident, as it is a rich source for preadipocytes, mesenchymal stem cells, endothelial progenitor cells, T regulatory cells and anti-inflammatory macrophages.
  
  Immune Cell Therapy, Adoptive T cell
  
 Adoptive T cell therapy for cancer is a form of transfusion therapy consisting of the infusion of various mature T cell subsets with the goal of eliminating a tumor and preventing its recurrence.  In cases such as cancer, where the disease is unique to the individual, the adoptive T cell therapy is a personalized treatment.
  
 We believe that an increasing portion of healthcare spending both in China and worldwide will be directed to immune cell therapies, driven by an aging population, and the potential for immune cell therapy treatments to become a safe, effective, and cost-effective method for treating millions of cancer patients.
  
 Cancer is a major threat to public health and the solvency of health systems worldwide.  Current treatments for these diseases cannot meet medical needs. We believe that immune cell therapy is a new technology that has the potential to alleviate much of the burden of these chronic and degenerative diseases in a cost-effective manner.

  Tumor Cell Specific Dendritic Cells (TC-DC)
  
 Recent scientific findings indicate the presence of special cells in tumors that are responsible for cancer metastases and relapse. Referred to as “cancer stem cells”, these cells make up only a small portion of the tumor mass. The central concept behind TC-DC therapy is to immunize against these cells. TC-DC therapy takes a sample of the patient’s own purified and irradiated cancer cells and combines them with specialized immune cells, thereby ‘educating’ the immune cells to destroy the cancer stem cells from which tumors arise.  We believe the selective targeting of cells that drive tumor growth would allow for effective cancer treatment without the risks and side effects of current therapies that also destroy healthy cells in the body.
  
 Our strategy is, through the acquisition of AG and the technologies and pre-clinical and clinical data of University of the South Florida and PLAGH, to become an immune cell business leader in the China cancer therapy market and specialty pharmaceutical market by utilizing CBMG’s attractiveness as a NASDAQ listed company to consolidate key China immune cell technology leaders with fortified intellectual property and ramp up revenue with first mover’s advantage in a safe and efficient manner.  The Company plans to accelerate cancer trials by using the knowledge and experience gained from the Company’s ongoing KOA trials and the recent, CAR-T and Tcm technologies.   Immune cell therapies have not been codified by any of the Chinese regulatory agencies. On December 16, 2016, the CFDA issued solicited feedback on its draft "Technical Guidelines for Research and Evaluation of Cellular Products”, signaling near term clarification and codification/of the cell therapy regulation. We believe this will create substantial barrier-to-entry for newcomers in China. However, it remains unclear if any of our clinical trials will qualify for U.S.FDA-liked Fast Track designation as maintenance therapy in subjects with advanced cancer who have limited options following surgery and front-line platinum/taxane chemotherapy to improve their progression-free survival. By applying U.S. SOP and protocols and following authorized treatment plans in China, we believe we are differentiated from our competition as we believe we have first mover’s advantage and a fortified barrier to entry.  In addition, encouraged by the recent CIRM grant of $2.29 million for our preclinical trial to replicate and validate the manufacturing process and control system at the cGMP facility located at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles to support the filing of an IND with the FDA, we have begun to review the feasibility of performing synergistic U.S. KOA clinical trial.

  Manufacturing
  
 We manufacture cells for our own research, testing and clinical trials. We are planning to scale up and expand our manufacturing capacity to treat 10,000 CAR-T and 10,000 KOA patients per year at the end of 2017. Our facilities are operated by a manufacturing and technology team with more than 30 years of relevant experience in China, EU, and the U.S.
  
 In any precision setting, it is vital that all controlled environment equipment meet certain design standards. We operate our manufacturing facilities under good manufacturing practice ("GMP") conditions in the ISO accredited laboratories standard. We employ an institutionalized and proprietary process and quality management system to optimize reproducibility and to hone our efficiency. Three of our facilities designed and built to GMP in Beijing, Shanghai and Wuxi, China meet international standards. Specifically, our Shanghai cleanroom facility underwent rigorous cleanroom certification since 2013. Our facility in Shanghai was issued a Certificate of Compliance by ENV Services, Inc., an ISO Inspection Service Provider, that (i) its rooms 17, 10 are certified to ISO Class 7 per ISO14644 in accordance with cGMP. (ii) its biological safety cabinets are certified per NSF/ANSI 49 and to ISO Class 5. and (iii) its instrumentation calibration has been certified to perform in accordance with ANS/NCSL Z5401 and document in accordance with 10CFR21. The cleanrooms in Beijing are certified to meet the standard of CNAS L1669 and our Wuxi facility has been certified to meet the CNAS L0221 standard. With our integrated Plasmid, Viral Vectors, and CAR-T cells Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls process as well as planned capacity expansion, we believe that are highly distinguishable with other companies in the cellular medicine space.

 In January 2017, we leased a 10,501.6 square meter building located in the “Pharma Valley” of Shanghai, the People’s Republic of China. We plan to establish 4,000 square meters GMP facilities there with 25 clean-rooms and equipped with 12 independent production lines to support clinical batch production and commercial scale manufacturing. With above expansion, the Company could support around 10,000 patients with CAR-T therapy and 10,000 KOA patients with the stem cell therapy per annum.
  
 We have built cell preparation and inspection laboratories that enable the following mode of human body immune cell in-vitro culture service to be provided: make cell preparation for human body venous blood samples, after completion of the cell preparation, deliver the immune cell agents to the customer; and provide immune function evaluation for the patients in Jilin and several other hospitals in China. 
  
  Planned Capital Expenditures
  
 We are expanding our Wuxi facility and are planning to move to a new Shanghai facility. We plan to continue to implement closed systems and may equip additional facilities according to future demands. By the end of 2017, the Company anticipates that the new Zhangjiang facility in Shanghai, an expanded Wuxi facility, and Beijing GMP facilities combined will have 70,000 square feet, and the Company expects that it will be capable of supporting simultaneous clinical trials for five different CAR-T and stem cell products, or the ability to treat approximately 10,000 cancer patients and 10,000 stem cell patients per year.
 Competition
  
 Many companies operate in the cellular biopharmaceutical field.  In 2010, the FDA approved the first cell therapy for Dendreon Corporation to apply an autologous cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of a certain type of prostate cancer. In May 2012 the Canadian authorities approved the first stem cell drug and granted Osiris Therapeutics’ manufactured stem cell product for use in the pediatric graft-versus-host disease. To date there are over thirty publicly listed and several private cellular biopharmaceutical focused companies outside of China with varying phases of clinical trials addressing a variety of diseases. We compete with these companies in bringing cellular therapies to the market.  However, our focus is to develop a core business in the China market. This difference in focus places us in a different competitive environment from other western companies with respect to fund raising, clinical trials, collaborative partnerships, and the markets in which we compete. 
  
 The PRC central government has a focused strategy to enable China to compete effectively in certain designated areas of biotechnology and the health sciences. Because of the aging population in China, China’s Ministry of Science and Technology (“MOST”) has targeted stem cell development as high priority field, and development in this field has been intense in the agencies under MOST. For example, the 973 Program has funded a number of stem cell research projects such as differentiation of human embryonic germ cells and the plasticity of adult stem cells. China has had a highly fragmented cellular medicine landscape.  Shenzhen Beike Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (“Beike”) and Union Stem Cell & Gene Engineering Co., Ltd. (“Union Stem Cell”) are two large stem cell companies in China. To the best of our knowledge, none of the Chinese companies are utilizing our proposed international manufacturing protocol and our unique technologies in conducting what we believe will be fully compliant CFDA-sanctioned clinical trials to commercialize cell therapies in China.  Our management believes that it is difficult for most of these Chinese companies to turn their results into translational stem cell science or commercially successful therapeutic products using internationally acceptable standards.
  
 We compete globally with respect to the discovery and development of new cell based therapies, and we also compete within China to bring new therapies to market.  The biotechnology industry, namely in the areas of cell processing and manufacturing, clinical development of cellular therapies and cell collection, processing and storage, are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition.  Our competitors worldwide include pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as numerous academic and research institutions and government agencies engaged in drug discovery activities or funding, in the U.S., Europe and Asia. Many of these companies are well-established and possess technical, research and development, financial, and sales and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, many of our smaller potential competitors have formed strategic collaborations, partnerships and other types of joint ventures with larger, well established industry competitors that afford these companies potential research and development and commercialization advantages in the technology and therapeutic areas currently being pursued by us.  Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting and financing research activities which may produce products directly competitive to those being commercialized by us. Moreover, many of these competitors may be able to obtain patent protection, obtain government (e.g. FDA) and other regulatory approvals and begin commercial sales of their products before us.

 Our primary competitors in the field of stem cell therapy for osteoarthritis, and other indications include Beike, Cytori Therapeutics Inc., Caladrius Biosciences, Inc. and others.  Among our competitors, to our knowledge, the only ones based in and operating in Greater China are Beike, Lorem Vascular, which has partnered with Cytori to commercialize Cytori Cell Therapy for the cardiovascular, renal and diabetes markets in China and Hong Kong, and OLife Bio, a Medi-Post joint venture with JingYuan Bio in Taian, Shandong Province, who plans to initiate clinical trial in China in 2016.  Our primary competitors in the field of cancer immune cell therapies include pharmaceutical, biotechnology companies such as Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc., Juno Therapeutics, Inc., Kite Pharma, Inc., CARSgen, Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. and others.  Among our competitors, the ones based in and operating in Greater China are BeiGene, Limited, CARsgen and China Oncology Focus Limited, which has licensed Sorrento’s anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody for Greater China. Other western big pharma and biotech companies in the cancer immune cell therapies space are starting to make inroads into China by partnering or seeking to partner with local companies. For example, in April, 2016, Seattle- based Juno Therapeutics, Inc. started a new company with WuXi AppTec in China named JW Biotechnology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. Its mission is to build China's leading cell therapy company by leveraging Juno's chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and T cell receptor (TCR) technologies together with WuXi AppTec's R&D and manufacturing platform and local expertise to develop novel cell-based immunotherapies for patients with hematologic and solidorgan cancers. Similarly, in January 2017, Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical announced its plan to create a joint venture with Santa Monica-based Kite Pharma Inc. to develop, manufacture and commercialize axicabtagene ciloleucel in China with the option to include additional products, including two T cell receptor (TCR) product candidates from Kite. Axicabtagene ciloleucel is Kite's lead product candidate and is an investigational chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy under development for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.
 
 Additionally, in the general area of cell-based therapies for osteoarthritis ailments, we potentially compete with a variety of companies, most of whom are specialty medical products or biotechnology companies. Some of these, such as Baxter, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic and Miltenyi Biotec, are well-established and have substantial technical and financial resources compared to ours.  However, as cell-based products are only just emerging as viable medical therapies, many of our most direct competitors are smaller biotechnology and specialty medical products companies. These include Vericel Corporation, Regeneus Ltd., Advanced Cell Technology, Inc., Cytomedix, Inc., Arteriocyte Medical Systems, Inc., Athersys, Inc., Bioheart, Inc., Cytori Therapeutics, Inc., Genzyme Corporation, Harvest Technologies Corporation, Mesoblast, Osiris Therapeutics, Inc., Pluristem, Inc. and others.
  
 Some of our competitors also work with adipose-derived stem cells.  To the best of our knowledge, none of these companies are currently utilizing the same technologies as ours to treat KOA, nor to our knowledge are any of these companies conducting government-approved clinical trials in China.
  
 Some of our targeted disease applications may compete with drugs from traditional pharmaceutical or Traditional Chinese Medicine companies. We believe that our chosen targeted disease applications are not effectively in competition with the products and therapies offered by traditional pharmaceutical or Traditional Chinese Medicine companies.

 We believe we have a strategic advantage over our competitors based on our ability to meet cGMP regulatory requirements, a capability which we believe is possessed by few to none of our competitors in China, in an industry in which meeting exacting standards and achieving extremely high purity levels is crucial to success.  In addition, in comparison to the broader range of cellar biopharmaceutical firms, we believe we have the advantages of cost and expediency, and a first mover advantage with respect to commercialization of cell therapy products and treatments in the Greater China market.
  
  Employees
  
 As of December 31, 2016, the total enrollment of full time employees of CBMG is 109. Among these 109 professionals, 18 have PhD degrees, 45 have postgraduate degrees and 37 have undergraduate degrees.  In other words, 92% of our employees are well qualified professionals. As a biotech company, 79 out of our 109 employees have medical or biological scientific credentials and qualifications.
 Facilities
  
 Our corporate headquarters are located at 19925 Stevens Creek Blvd., Suite 100 in Cupertino, California. We currently pay rent for a total of $77,000 per month for an aggregate of approximately 80,000 square feet of space to house our administration, research and manufacturing facilities in Maryland and in the cities of, Wuxi, Beijing and Shanghai in China. On January 1, 2017, CBMG Shanghai entered into a 10-year lease agreement with Shanghai Chuangtong Industrial Development Co., Ltd., pursuant to which the Company leased a 10,501.6 square meter building located in the “Pharma Valley” of Shanghai, the People’s Republic of China for research and development, manufacturing and office space purposes. Subject to a 5-month rent-free renovation period, the monthly rent for the first two years is determined by floor and ranges from 3.7 yuan to 4.3 yuan per square meter per day, for an aggregate monthly rent for the entire Property of approximately 1.3 million yuan ($187,064). The term of the Lease is 10 years, starting from January 1, 2017 and ending on December 31, 2026 (the “Original Term”). During the Original Term, the monthly rent will increase by 6% every two years. As previously disclosed in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 on November 8, 2016, the Company paid the landlord a non-refundable deposit of 1.2 million yuan ($179,700).
 Certain Tax Matters
  
 Following the completion of our merger with EastBridge Investment Group Corporation (Delaware) on February 6, 2013, CBMG and its controlled subsidiaries (the “CBMG Entities”) became a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) under U.S. Internal Revenue Code Section 957. As a result, the CBMG Entities are subject to anti-deferral provisions within the U.S. federal income tax system that were designed to limit deferral of taxable earnings otherwise achieved by putting profit in low taxed offshore entities. While the CBMG Entities are subject to review under such provisions, the CBMG Entities’ earnings are from an active business and should not be deemed to be distributions made to its U.S. parent company.
  
 Pursuant to the Corporate Income Tax Law of the PRC, all of the Company’s PRC subsidiaries are liable to PRC CIT at a rate of 25% except for Cellular Biomedicine Group Ltd. (Shanghai) (“CBMG Shanghai”). According to Guoshuihan 2009 No. 203, if an entity is certified as an “advanced and new technology enterprise”, it is entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 15%. CBMG Shanghai obtained the certificate of “advanced and new technology enterprise” dated October 30, 2015 with an effective period of three years and the provision for PRC corporate income tax for CBMG Shanghai is calculated by applying the income tax rate of 15% in 2016 (2015: 15%; 2014: 25%).

 Our cellular medicine business operates in a highly regulated environment.  In China, aside from provincial and local licensing authorities, hospitals and their internal ethics and utilization committees, and a system of institutional review boards (“IRBs”) which in many cases have members appointed by provincial authorities, Cell therapy regulations have not been codified by any of the Chinese regulatory agencies. On December 16, 2016, the CFDA solicited feedback on its draft "Technical Guidelines for Research and Evaluation of Cellular Products”, signaling near term codification / clarification of the cell therapy regulation. We believe this will create substantial barrier-to-entry for newcomers in China. However, it remains unclear if any of our clinical trials will be offered U.S.FDA-liked Fast Track designation as maintenance therapy in subjects with advanced cancer who have limited options following surgery and front-line platinum/taxane chemotherapy to improve their progression-free survival. By applying U.S. SOP and protocols and following authorized treatment plans in China, we believe we are differentiated from our competition as we believe we have first mover’s advantage and a fortified barrier to entry.  In addition, we began to review the feasibility of performing synergistic U.S. clinical studies.

  PRC Operating Licenses
  
 Our business operations in China are subject to customary regulation and licensing requirements under regulatory agencies including the local Administration for Industry and Commerce, General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, and the State Administration of Taxation, for each of our business locations. Additionally, our clean room facilities and the use of reagents is also regulated by local branches of the Ministry of Environmental Protection. We are in good standing with respect to each of our business operating licenses. 
 U.S. Government Regulation
  
 The health care industry is one of the most highly regulated industries in the United States. The federal government, individual state and local governments, as well as private accreditation organizations, oversee and monitor the activities of individuals and businesses engaged in the development, manufacture and delivery of health care products and services. Federal laws and regulations seek to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the United States, as well as to prevent fraud and abuse associated with the purchase of health care products and services with federal monies. The relevant state and local laws and regulations similarly seek to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the states’ citizens and prevent fraud and abuse. Accreditation organizations help to establish and support industry standards and monitor new developments.
  
  HCT/P Regulations
  
 Manufacturing facilities that produce cellular therapies are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. FDA. In particular, U.S. FDA regulations set forth requirements pertaining to establishments that manufacture human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (“HCT/Ps”). Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1271 (21 CFR Part 1271) provides for a unified registration and listing system, donor-eligibility, current Good Tissue Practices (“cGTP”), and other requirements that are intended to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases by HCT/Ps. While we currently have no plans to conduct these activities within the United States, these regulations may be relevant to us if in the future we become subject to them, or if parallel rules are imposed on our operations in China.
  
 We currently collect, process, store and manufacture HCT/Ps, including manufacturing cellular therapy products. We also collect, process, and store HCT/Ps. Accordingly, we comply with cGTP and cGMP guidelines that apply to biological products. Our management believes that certain other requirements pertaining to biological products, such as requirements pertaining to premarket approval, do not currently apply to us because we are not currently investigating, marketing or selling cellular therapy products in the United States. If we change our business operations in the future, the FDA requirements that apply to us may also change.
  
 Certain state and local governments within the United States also regulate cell-processing facilities by requiring them to obtain other specific licenses. Certain states may also have enacted laws and regulations, or may be considering laws and regulations, regarding the use and marketing of stem cells or cell therapy products, such as those derived from human embryos. While these laws and regulations should not directly affect our business, they could affect our future business. Presently we are not subject to any of these state law requirements, because we do not conduct these regulated activities within the United States.
  
  Pharmaceutical and Biological Products
  
 In the United States, pharmaceutical and biological products, including cellular therapies, are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act. However, because most biological products also meet the definition of “drugs” under the FD&C Act, they are also subject to regulation under FD&C Act provisions. The PHS Act requires the submission of a biologics license application (“BLA”), rather than a New Drug Application ("NDA"), for market authorization. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are similar to those for NDAs, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as drugs. Presently we are not subject to any of these requirements, because we do not conduct these regulated activities within the United States.  However, these regulations may be relevant to us should we engage in these activities in the United States in the future.
