Certain Significant Developments
Pending Acquisition by Parker-Hannifin Corporation
On December 1, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Parker-Hannifin merger agreement”) with Parker-Hannifin Corporation (“Parker-Hannifin”) and Parker Eagle Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parker-Hannifin (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which, upon the closing of the merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the Company will survive as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parker-Hannifin (the “pending Parker-Hannifin transaction”). Upon the closing of this merger, each share of the Company’s common stock, par value $1.00 per share (other than treasury stock and any shares of the Company’s common stock owned by the Company, Parker-Hannifin, Merger Sub, any of their wholly owned subsidiaries, or any person who properly demands statutory appraisal of their shares) will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $83.00 without interest. Upon completion of the merger, the Company's common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.
The pending Parker-Hannifin transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of calendar year 2017, and is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval of the merger by the Company’s stockholders and receipt of applicable foreign regulatory approvals.
Acquisitions
On March 7, 2016, the Company acquired certain assets of FibeRio Technology Corporation (“FibeRio”), a technology company focused on the research, development and commercialization of performance fabric and filtration media, for a purchase price of approximately $11.9 million consisting of $8.0 million in cash and $3.9 million in contingent earn-out liability. The assets acquired and the activities of FibeRio have been merged into the Company's Innovation Center, located near the Company's headquarters in Franklin, Tennessee, which supports the Company's global growth and innovation activities including research and development. Further information regarding this business acquisition is included in Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
On January 29, 2016, the Company acquired certain assets of TDC Filter Manufacturing, Inc. (“TDC”), a manufacturer and supplier of pleated filter bags, dust collection cartridges and gas turbine air filters, for a purchase price of approximately $11.3 million. The operations of TDC have been merged into the Company's CLARCOR Industrial Air business, headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas, which is part of the Company's Industrial/Environmental Filtration segment. Further information regarding this business acquisition is included in Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Restructuring and Cost Reduction Initiatives
In November 2015, the Company announced a reduction-in-force as a part of a broader effort to more closely align operating expenses with the Company's long-term strategic initiatives and macroeconomic business conditions. The Company recognized approximately $5.6 million of pre-tax restructuring charges in fiscal year 2015 in connection with this reduction-in-force, consisting of severance and other employee termination benefits, substantially all of which are expected to be settled in cash. In addition, as previously disclosed, we undertook several other cost reduction initiatives in fiscal 2016, including, but not limited to, leveraging purchasing and logistics spending across our historically decentralized business units, reducing discretionary selling and administrative expenses, and implementing facility consolidations including reductions-in-force. In fiscal 2016, we recognized

approximately $4.4 million of pre-tax restructuring charges consisting of severance and other employee termination benefits, facility closures costs, and other upfront costs in connection with these cost reduction initiatives, substantially all of which are expected to be settled in cash. Further information regarding this restructuring is included in Note I to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
(b) Financial Information About Industry Segments
During fiscal year 2016, the Company conducted business in two principal industry segments: (1) Engine/Mobile Filtration and (2) Industrial/Environmental Filtration. These segments are discussed in greater detail below.  Financial information for each of the Company’s reportable segments for the fiscal years 2014 through 2016 is included in Note Q to our Consolidated Financial Statements. On June 27, 2015, the Company completed the disposition of J.L. Clark, Inc., which was the only operating company within the Company's former Packaging segment. Further information regarding this disposition is included in Note C to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
(c) Narrative Description of Business
Engine/Mobile Filtration 
The Company’s Engine/Mobile Filtration segment manufactures and sells filtration products for on-road and off-road mobile and stationary applications, including trucks, agricultural machinery, construction and mining equipment, power generation, marine, automobiles, transit buses, locomotives and other industrial and specialty applications.  The segment’s filtration products are manufactured and sold throughout the world, primarily in the aftermarket, but also to first-fit original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") and through original equipment suppliers and wholesale distribution channels. 
The products manufactured and sold in the Engine/Mobile Filtration segment include both first-fit filtration systems as well as replacement products such as oil, air, fuel, coolant, transmission and hydraulic filters that are used in a wide variety of applications and in processes where filtration efficiency, capacity and reliability are critical. Most of these applications involve a process through which impurities in an air or fluid stream are removed by engineered filtration media such as semi-porous paper, corrugated paper, cotton, synthetic, chemical or membrane filter media with varying filtration efficiency characteristics.  The impurities captured by the media are generally disposed of when the filter is changed.
Industrial/Environmental Filtration 

 The Company’s Industrial/Environmental Filtration segment manufactures and sells filtration products used in industrial and commercial processes, and in buildings and infrastructures of various types.  The segment’s products are sold throughout the world, and include liquid process, natural gas and air filtration products and systems used to protect critical equipment, to support the processing and transportation of fuels and feedstocks, to maintain high interior air quality and to control exterior pollution.
The segment’s liquid process filtration products include specialty industrial process liquid filters; filters for pharmaceutical processes and beverages; filtration systems, filters and coalescers for the oil and natural gas industry; filtration systems for aircraft refueling, anti-pollution, sewage treatment and water recycling; bilge water separators; sand control filters for oil and gas drilling; and woven wire and metallic products for filtration of plastics and polymer fibers.  These filters use a variety of string wound, meltblown, porous and sintered and non-sintered metal media, woven wire and absorbent media.
 The segment’s air filtration products represent air filters and systems, including advanced medias and treatments and high efficiency first-fit systems.  These products are used in gas turbine power generation systems, heavy industrial manufacturing processes, thermal power plants, commercial buildings, hospitals, general factories, residential buildings, residences, paint spray booths, medical devices and facilities, motor vehicle systems, aircraft cabins, clean rooms, compressors and compressor stations.
Packaging
The Company’s Packaging segment was conducted by a wholly-owned subsidiary, J.L. Clark, Inc. (“J.L. Clark”). On June 27, 2015, the Company completed the disposition of J.L. Clark. Further information regarding this disposition is included in Note C to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Prior to this disposition, J.L. Clark manufactured a wide variety of different types and sizes of containers and packaging specialties.  Metal, plastic and combination metal/plastic containers and closures manufactured by J.L. Clark are used in packaging a wide variety of dry and paste form products, such as food specialties (e.g., tea, coffee, spices, mints and other confections); 
 4

smokeless tobacco products; lip balms; ointments; and consumer healthcare products.  Other packaging products include shells for dry cell batteries, canisters for film and candles, spools for insulated and fine wire, and custom decorated flat metal sheets.
Distribution 
Products in both the Engine/Mobile Filtration and Industrial/Environmental Filtration segments are sold primarily through a combination of independent distributors, OEMs and their dealer networks, retail stores and directly to end-use customers such as truck and equipment fleet users, manufacturing companies and contractors.  In addition, both segments manufacture and distribute products worldwide through their respective foreign subsidiaries and through export sales from the United States to independent distributors and end-use customers. Prior to the disposition of J.L. Clark, the Packaging segment used an internal sales force and sold its products directly to customers for containers and packaging specialties.  
Financial information related to the geographic areas in which the Company operates and sells its products is included in Note Q to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Class of Products
No class of similar products accounted for 10% or more of the total sales of the Company in any of the Company's last three fiscal years.
Raw Materials
The primary raw materials the Company uses to manufacture and package its products include various types of steel, adhesives, petrochemical-based materials, wood based products and filter medias made from materials such as wood pulps, metals, polyester, polypropylene, fiberglass and other synthetic fibers.  All of these are purchased and are available from a variety of sources, although qualifying alternate suppliers for certain raw materials, principally certain filter media grades, can be a lengthy process.  The Company experienced somewhat volatile pricing for many commodities in fiscal year 2016. Raw material prices, especially in significant spend categories such as steel and petrochemical-based materials including adhesives, saw significant fluctuations during fiscal year 2016. The Company was able to procure adequate supplies of raw materials throughout fiscal year 2016 and does not anticipate procurement problems in 2017 although the Company may experience higher raw material costs in fiscal 2017 based on current forecasts regarding expectations for material costs over this period of time.
Patents, Trademarks and Trade names
Certain features of some of the Company’s products are covered by domestic and, in some cases, foreign patents or patent applications.  While these patents are valuable and important for certain products, the Company does not believe that its competitive position is dependent upon patent protection, although as discussed under the heading of “Risk Factors,” the Company believes that patent-related litigation may become more commonplace across all of its business segments, particularly with respect to its engine aftermarket business.
With respect to trademarks and trade names, the Company believes that the trademarks and trade names it uses in connection with certain products (such as “Baldwin,” “Purolator,” “PecoFacet,” “Fuel Manager,” “Altair” and “BHA”) are valuable and significant to its business. 
Seasonality
In general, the Company’s products and service offerings are not seasonal in nature, although certain of the Company's operating companies in all our segments experience modest seasonal increases and decreases with respect to products and services supplied to particular end-use customers or industries.  These shifts are normally not material to the Company on a consolidated basis.
Customers
The 10 largest customers of the Engine/Mobile Filtration segment accounted for approximately 35% of the $586.0 million of fiscal year 2016 segment sales.
The 10 largest customers of the Industrial/Environmental Filtration segment accounted for approximately 16% of the $803.5 million of fiscal year 2016 segment sales.
 5

No single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated fiscal year 2016 sales.
Backlog
At December 3, 2016, the Company had a backlog of open orders for products of approximately $207.9 million.  The backlog figure for November 28, 2015 was approximately $243.4 million.  The decrease in backlog at December 3, 2016 compared to November 28, 2015 was primarily due to timing of gas turbine orders and declining order levels for filtration vessels in the natural gas market served by our Industrial/Environmental Filtration segment. The majority of the orders on hand at December 3, 2016 are expected to be filled during fiscal year 2017; some orders, primarily related to filtration systems for gas turbine air intake filtration applications, are expected to be filled during fiscal year 2018.  The Company does not view its backlog as being insufficient, excessive or problematic, or a significant indication of fiscal year 2017 sales.
Competition
The Company encounters strong competition in the sale of all of its products.  The Company competes in a number of filtration markets against a variety of competitors.  The Company is unable to state its relative competitive position in all of these markets due to a lack of reliable industry-wide data.  However, in the replacement market for heavy-duty liquid and air filters used in internal combustion engines, the Company believes that it is among the top five companies worldwide measured by annual sales.  In addition, the Company believes that it is a leading manufacturer of liquid and air filters for diesel locomotives.  The Company believes that for industrial and environmental filtration products, it is among the top ten companies worldwide measured by annual sales, and is a market leader with respect to filtration products used in the oil and gas industries and in gas turbine applications.
On June 27, 2015, the Company completed the disposition of J.L. Clark, Inc., which was the only operating company within the Company's Packaging segment. Prior to that disposition, in the Packaging segment the Company’s principal competitors included several manufacturers that often competed on a regional basis only and whose specialty packaging segments were smaller than the Company’s.  Prior to that disposition, the Company also faced strong competition by manufacturers of paper, plastic and glass containers.  
The Company believes that it is able to maintain its competitive position because of the quality and breadth of its products and services and the broad geographic scope of its operations.  The Company’s products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, speed of delivery, quality and customer support.
Product Development
The Company develops products on its own and in consultation or partnership with its customers.  In addition to product testing and development that occurs at the Company’s various subsidiaries, in fiscal year 2015 the Company opened the CLARCOR Innovation Center, a standalone research and development ("R&D") center in Columbia, Tennessee (the “CIC”). The CIC houses research scientists and engineers, research and testing laboratories, pilot and production lines, and training facilities, and serves as the Company's central R&D center in support of the Company's operating subsidiaries. Build-out of the facility was mostly completed in 2016. 
The Company’s laboratories, including the CIC, test product components and completed products to ensure high-quality manufacturing results, evaluate competitive products, aid suppliers in the development of product components, and conduct controlled tests of newly designed filters and filtration systems for particular uses.  Product development is concerned with the improvement and creation of new filters and filtration media and filtration systems in order to increase performance characteristics, broaden respective uses and counteract obsolescence. 
In fiscal year 2016, the Company employed approximately 173 professional employees on either a full-time or part-time basis to conduct research activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement or redesign of its existing products.  During this period, the Company spent approximately $26.3 million on such activities as compared with $21.7 million for fiscal year 2015 and $18.1 million for fiscal year 2014.
Environmental Factors 
The Company is not aware of any facts which would cause it to believe that it is in material violation of existing applicable standards with respect to emissions to the atmosphere, discharges to waters, or treatment, storage and disposal of solid or hazardous wastes.
 6

The Company is party to various proceedings relating to environmental issues.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and/or other responsible state agencies have designated the Company as a potentially responsible party, along with other companies, in remedial activities for the cleanup of waste sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (commonly referred to as the federal Superfund statute).  Additionally, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Protection has identified the property on which one of the Company's subsidiaries, CLARCOR Engine Mobile Solutions, currently operates as having concentrations of certain chemicals in groundwater that are above regulatory action levels.
Although it is not certain what future environmental claims, if any, may be asserted in connection with these known environmental matters, the Company currently believes that its potential liability for known environmental matters is not material and that it has adequately reserved for any associated liabilities based on the information available to the Company.  However, environmental and related remediation costs are difficult to quantify for a number of reasons, including the number of parties involved, the difficulty in determining the nature and extent of the contamination at issue, the length of time remediation may require, the complexity of the environmental regulation, the continuing advancement of remediation technology, and the potential imposition of joint and several liability on each potentially responsible party for the cleanup.
The Company does anticipate, however, that it may be required to install additional pollution control equipment to augment or replace existing equipment in the future in order to meet applicable environmental standards.  The Company is presently unable to predict the timing or the cost of any project of this nature and cannot give any assurance that the cost of such projects may not have a material adverse effect on earnings.  However, the Company is not aware, at this time, of any other additional significant current or pending requirements to install such equipment at any of its facilities.
Employees
As of December 3, 2016, the Company had approximately 5,773 employees.
