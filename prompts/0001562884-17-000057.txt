Plan of Operations
 
Products
 
Mobile marketing encompasses many different types of marketing techniques and strategies that help businesses increase profits and ROI (Return on Investment). The most popular forms of mobile marketing today are: mobile-friendly websites, SMS Text Message Marketing, QR (Quick Response) Codes and Mobile apps.
 
We intend to offer the following services:
 

Mobile-friendly
websites: A mobile optimized website is a website that is designed specifically for smartphones, not a desktop computer. This
is important because the small screen is much different than a 17" screen. Mobile screen real estate is smaller and must
be used much more strategically.

A
mobile optimized website doesn't require that someone scroll left/right. It doesn't require that someone pinch and zoom to read
text, either. On a mobile site, the navigation is built for efficiency, the images are optimized for quick loading and the content
is minimized to be most effective. Additionally, mobile-only functionality includes tap-to-call, tap-to-email and tap for Google
Maps functionality, that respectfully allows mobile site visitors to call, send an email or show business location on an integrated
Google maps application with only one click, without need to punch numbers or letters one by one, making it much more efficient
and useful for a mobile website visitor.


SMS
text message marketing: Sending marketing offers through cellphones SMS (Short Message Service) that enable targeted marketing
in the last minute. The Mobile Lads system relies on SMS technology with no real application needed in the mobile device. Only
basic SMS support is required which is present in every mobile phone. From the users point of view the advertisement procedure
starts when the user receives a Mobile Lads SMS ad with the advertised product, information and product identification code. The
user then simply presents the product identification code at the register at the point of sale to receive mentioned discount or
special offer.


QR
(Quick Response) codes: A QR code (quick response code) is a type of 2D bar code that is used to provide easy access to information
through a smartphone application that is designed to read that bar code working in conjunction with the phone's camera. The reader
interprets the code, which typically contains a call to action such as an invitation to download a mobile application, a link
to view a video or an SMS message inviting the viewer to respond to a poll. The phone's owner can choose to act upon the call
to action or click cancel and ignore the invitation.


We are not involved in developing a web based management system for our operations. We intend to use third party applications for our needs. We signed a web based terms and services agreement with Twilio Inc., and would act as a reseller of Twilio Inc services, (SMS messaging services). Twilio Inc itself does not work with retail businesses. It works only with marketers/resellers, who buy their credits/SMS in bulk.
 
Target Market
 
One of the biggest strengths of our products is that they will be utilized by any gender, age, nationality or education level. Our products can be used in different sorts of businesses: advertising, retail, entertainment; and due to their low cost can be enjoyed by anyone who wants their business to grow.
 
We will focus on larger businesses with big capacity such as movie theatres, spa hotels, amusement parks, concerts, sports events and medium size businesses like restaurants, medical offices, and service companies, like cleaners, roofers, plumbers, etc.
 
Trademark
 
We do not have a trademark registered at this time. At present, we have not established a valuable brand which requires protection. We may register a trademark in the next 12 months when we feel that our brand is beginning to gain value and recognition.
Government Regulation
 
We do not believe that government regulations will have a material impact on the way we conduct business.
 
Research and Development
 
We have not spent any amounts on research and development activities during the year ended April 30, 2016. We anticipate that we will not incur any expenses on research and development over the next 12 months. Our planned expenditures on our operations or a business combination are summarized under the section of this annual report entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations”.
