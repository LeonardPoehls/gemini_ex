Item 1. Business
General
We provide comprehensive intelligence-based cybersecurity solutions that allow organizations to prepare for, prevent, respond to and remediate cyber attacks. Our portfolio of cybersecurity products and services is designed to detect and prevent attacks as well as enable rapid discovery and response when a breach occurs. We accomplish this through the “productization” of our three core competitive advantages:

• | Our high efficacy detection of known and unknown threats by our proprietary Multi-vector Virtual Execution (MVX) engine and intelligence-driven analysis (IDA) technologies,


• | Our intelligence on threats and threat actors, based on the continuous flow of new attack data from our global network of sensors and virtual machines, as well as intelligence gathered by our security researchers and incident responders, and


• | Our accumulated security expertise derived from responding to thousands of significant breaches over the past decade.

Our MVX-based detection and prevention solutions encompass web, email, endpoint, cloud and content (file) attack vectors, and provide the first line of defense against known and unknown attacks. These products are complemented by our network forensics, cloud-based intelligence and threat analytics, managed security services, cybersecurity consulting and incident response offerings. In combination, our products and services enable a proactive approach to cybersecurity that extends across the security operations cycle to reduce organizations’ overall cyber-risk at a lower total cost of ownership.
We were founded in 2004 to address the inability of signature-based security solutions to detect the new generation of dynamic, stealthy and targeted cyberattacks, known as advanced persistent threats (APTs). To meet the challenges of detecting these previously unknown threats, for which there were no signatures, we developed our MVX engine, a purpose-built virtual machine-based threat detection and analysis engine. MVX employs a two-phased approach to deliver high fidelity alerts -- anomaly detection using our IDA technologies to capture suspicious content, followed by virtual machine validation to minimize costly false positive alerts. MVX generates a continuous flow of real-time “victim-based” threat data to our Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DTI) cloud, allowing our solutions to be updated in near-real time as new threats emerge.
We have expanded our business from a narrow focus on the detection of advanced threats to helping our customers improve their resilience to attacks using our technologies, intelligence and expertise. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we announced an early adopter program for our FireEye Helix cybersecurity platform. Helix integrates our network and endpoint security technologies, advanced threat intelligence, threat analytics, and orchestration capabilities in a single subscription offering designed to simplify security operations. The cloud-based Helix console provides a unified, customized view of an organization’s attack surface, enriching alerts from FireEye and third party security products with contextual threat intelligence on attackers’ identity, tools and techniques. Helix also includes pre-determined threat response “playbooks” based on Mandiant expertise and best practices. Helix allows security analysts to prioritize critical alerts, rapidly pivot from detection to response, and reduce the business impact of an attack.
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 5,600 end-customers, including more than 40% of the Forbes Global 2000. Our customers include leading enterprises in a diverse set of industries, including telecommunications, technology, financial services, public utilities, healthcare and oil and gas, as well as leading U.S. and international governmental agencies.
For 2016, 2015 and 2014, our revenue was $714.1 million, $623.0 million and $425.7 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 15% for 2016, 46% for 2015 and 163% for 2014, and our net losses were $480.1 million, $539.2 million and $443.8 million, respectively.
Our business is geographically diversified, with 69% of our total revenue from the United States, 14% from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), 13% from Asia Pacific and Japan (APAC), and 4% from other regions in 2016. See Note 15 contained in "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about our customers, revenue and long-lived assets by geographic region.
We were incorporated in Delaware in February 2004 under the name NetForts, Inc., and changed our name to FireEye, Inc. in September 2005. Our principal executive offices are located at 1440 McCarthy Blvd, Milpitas, California 95035, and our telephone number is (408) 321-6300. Our website is www.fireeye.com.

Our Technologies
We have developed proprietary technologies related to threat detection, virtual machine-based threat analysis, endpoint protection, and security orchestration. We believe these technologies, combined with our threat intelligence and security expertise, differentiate our products and services.
Advanced Threat Detection and Prevention Technology. At the core of our network, email, endpoint, and content security solutions is our proprietary, purpose-built Multi-Vector Virtual Execution (MVX) engine. We have developed our MVX engine to provide high efficacy threat protection through high fidelity detection, negligible false-positive rates, and minimal impact on network performance. Our foundational technologies in the MVX engine are: (i) line rate anomaly detection, (ii) proprietary virtual execution, and (iii) multi-flow cross correlation. We have built our technology over 10 years of research and development, and we believe it represents a significant competitive advantage for us. Because we first identify suspicious flows with our line rate anomaly detector, using Intelligent-Driven Analysis (IDA) technologies, and then, through a separate process, use our MVX engine to determine whether such suspicious flows are malicious, our technology can be deployed on a single integrated appliance, as a cloud-based service, or in a hybrid appliance/cloud architecture.
Advanced Endpoint Validation and Containment. Our endpoint security solution includes proprietary technologies that enable (i) automatic creation of indicators of compromise coupled with rapid enterprise-wide search, (ii) exploit detection and prevention, (iii) forensic data capture and (iv) rapid containment and investigation for connected and unconnected endpoints. Additionally, we have developed our endpoint technologies to correlate and consume threat intelligence from our network-based security solutions.
Evolved Network Security Architecture and Security Orchestration. Our solutions are designed to operate as part of a comprehensive security architecture to defend networks against today's advanced threats and minimize the business impact of attacks. The ability to monitor all traffic and file stores is critical to detecting next-generation threats that will enter through multiple vectors and move laterally across the network. We combine this visibility with our dynamic, contextual and strategic threat intelligence to enable rapid, prioritized response to critical alerts across the IT infrastructure using our security orchestration technologies and tools.
Customers
Our customer base has grown from approximately 450 end-customers at the end of 2011 to approximately 5,600 end-customers as of December 31, 2016, including more than 40% of the Forbes Global 2000. We provide products, subscriptions and services to customers of varying sizes, including enterprises, governmental agencies and educational and nonprofit organizations. Our customers include leading enterprises in a diverse set of industries, including telecommunications providers, financial services entities, Internet search engines, social networking sites, stock exchanges, electrical grid operators, networking vendors, oil and gas companies, healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and leading U.S. and international governmental agencies. Our business is not dependent on any particular end-customer as no end-customer represented more than 10% of our revenue for any of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, one reseller represented 12%, 13% and 11%, respectively, of our total revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, one distributor represented 19% and 17%, respectively, of our total revenue. No distributor represented 10% or greater of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014.
Backlog
Orders for subscriptions and services for multiple years are typically billed in their entirety shortly after receipt of the order and are included in deferred revenue. The timing of revenue recognition for subscriptions and services may vary depending on the contractual service period or when the services are rendered. Products are shipped and billed shortly after receipt of an order. The majority of our product revenue comes from orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter. We do not believe that our product backlog at any particular time is meaningful because it is not necessarily indicative of future revenue in any given period, as the fulfillment of such orders may be delayed.
Sales and Marketing
Sales. Our sales organization consists of in-house sales teams who work in collaboration with external channel partners to identify new sales prospects, sell additional products, subscriptions and services, and provide post-sale support. Our field sales team is organized by territory and is responsible for enterprise and government accounts within their region. Our inside sales organization is responsible for sales to medium-sized and smaller organizations, and for renewal of existing subscriptions.
We also have a dedicated team focused on channel sales who manage the relationships with our value-added reseller and distributor partners and work with these channel partners to win and support customers. We believe this hybrid direct-touch sales approach allows 
9

us to leverage the benefits of broader market coverage provided by a reseller channel while maintaining a face-to-face connection with our customers, including key enterprise accounts.
We have also cultivated alliances with non-traditional partners to generate customer referrals and extend our technologies and sales coverage to new market segments. These relationships include relationships with insurance providers, large systems integrators and managed service providers, and we have engaged in joint solution development with leading providers of engineering services and payment systems.
Our sales organization is supported by sales engineers with deep technical domain expertise who are responsible for pre-sales technical support, solutions engineering for our customers, proof of concept work and technical training for our channel partners. Our sales engineers also act as the liaison between customers and our marketing and product development organizations.
As part of our sales strategy, we often provide prospective customers with our detection and prevention products for a short-term evaluation period. In such cases, our products are deployed within the prospective customer’s network, typically for a period ranging from one week to several months. During this period, the prospective customer conducts evaluations with the assistance of our system engineers and members of our security research team. We believe that by providing proof of concept evaluations to potential customers, we are able to contrast the effectiveness of our platform versus our competitors in identifying suspicious and potentially malicious software code in their actual IT environments. Additionally, our Mandiant consultants use our technologies and products in their incident response and consulting engagements, providing de facto proof of concept evaluations in the customer’s environment. Our sales cycle varies by industry and can be long and unpredictable, but is typical of large, complex enterprise sales cycles that can last several months or more. However, some transactions can close in a few weeks when an active breach is discovered.
Marketing. Our marketing is focused on building our brand reputation and market awareness for our solutions, driving customer demand and a strong sales pipeline, and working with our channel partners around the globe. Our marketing team consists primarily of corporate marketing, channel marketing, account/lead development, operations and corporate communications. Marketing activities include demand generation, advertising, product launch activities, managing our corporate Website and partner portal, trade shows and conferences, press and analyst relations, and customer awareness. We are also actively engaged in driving global thought leadership programs through blogs and media and developing rich content such as the global cyber maps and threat reports.
Technology Alliance Partners
FireEye has built a robust ecosystem of Technology Alliance Partners who, through integration and joint go-to-market efforts, extend the breadth and depth of cybersecurity and protection customers gain from FireEye. Spanning multiple technology categories, including network monitoring vendors, security information and event management vendors, network equipment vendors, forensic software vendors and web application firewall vendors, these partnerships provide for threat intelligence sharing, cross-vendor technology integrations, and joint solution development. By helping to ease the complications that organizations face when implementing multi-layered security solutions, our technology alliances facilitate integrated solution design, accelerate the time to realize value, and enhance our role as a strategic security partner.
Government Affairs
We maintain relationships with several governments around the globe. Our thought leadership in defending against next-generation threats has helped to shape the legislative, regulatory and policy environment to better enhance these governments’ individual and collective cyber posture. As part of this effort, we contribute to the evolving standard-making processes, help define best practices in various jurisdictions and help organizations of all sizes better understand the cyber threat landscape. We also help governments identify future needs and requirements. Through these and related activities, we engage on the front lines of emerging cybersecurity related public policy and use our knowledge and insight to improve the cybersecurity of our government and industry customers.
Manufacturing
The manufacturing of our security products is outsourced to principally one third-party contract manufacturer. This approach allows us to reduce our costs as it reduces our manufacturing overhead and inventory and also allows us to adjust quickly to changing customer demand. Our manufacturing partner assembles our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish, and it procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions.
Our primary contract manufacturer is Flextronics Telecom Systems, Ltd., or Flextronics. The manufacturing agreement we have entered into with Flextronics does not provide for any minimum purchase commitments and had an initial term of one year and automatically renews for one-year terms, unless either party gives written notice to the other party not less than 90 days prior to the last day of the applicable term. Additionally, this agreement may be terminated by either party (i) with advance written notice provided to the other party, subject to certain notice period limitations, or (ii) with written notice, subject to applicable cure periods, if the other party has materially breached its obligations under the agreement.
10

Research and Development
We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our virtual execution detection engines and threat intelligence, build add-on functionality to our products and improve our core technologies. We believe that hardware, software and cloud-based technologies are critical to maintaining and expanding our leadership in the security industry. Our engineering teams have deep networking and security expertise and work closely with our customers to identify their current and future needs. Additionally, our Mandiant consultants use our products in their incident response and compromise assessment engagements and provide continual feedback to our engineering teams on product performance, detection efficacy, evasion techniques and attack trends.
In addition to our focus on platform expansion and enhancement, our research and development teams are focused on developing automation tools and machine learning techniques to reduce the time to discover and distribute new threat intelligence, as well as generate efficiencies in our services offerings. We are also investing in security platform management and orchestration capabilities to provide unified reporting and security orchestration features to customers in a single dashboard.
We maintain research and development activities across the globe with teams located in Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Singapore and the United States.
Research and development expense totaled $279.6 million, $279.5 million and $203.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Competition
We operate in the intensely competitive IT security market which is characterized by constant change and innovation. Changes in the threat landscape and broader IT infrastructures result in evolving customer requirements for security. Several vendors have either introduced new products or incorporated new features into existing products that compete with our solutions. Our current and potential future competitors fall into six general categories:

• | large networking vendors such as Cisco and Juniper that may emulate or integrate certain features similar to ours into their own products;


• | large companies such as Intel, IBM and HPE that have acquired security vendors in recent years and have the technical and financial resources to bring competitive solutions to the market;


• | independent security vendors such as Palo Alto Networks and Trend Micro that offer products or features that claim to perform similar functions to our platform;


• | small and large companies, including new market entrants, that offer narrow product solutions that compete with some of the features present in our platform;


• | providers of traditional signature-based security solutions, such as Symantec; and


• | other providers of incident response and compromise assessment services.

As our market grows and IT budgets are allocated to support protection from advanced threats, it will attract more highly specialized vendors as well as larger technology vendors that may continue to acquire or bundle their products more effectively. The principal competitive factors in our market include:

• | ability to deliver the combination of technology, intelligence and expertise necessary to combat the current threat landscape;


• | ability to detect and prevent known and unknown threats by overcoming the limitations of signature-based approaches, while maintaining a low rate of false-positive alerts;


• | scalability, throughput and overall performance of our detection and prevention technologies;


• | visibility into all stages of an attack, especially the exploit phase;


• | breadth and richness of the shared threat intelligence, including dynamic and contextual threat intelligence on cyber crime, cyber espionage, hacktivism, attacks on critical infrastructure and nation-state attacks;


• | flexible deployment options, including on-premise appliances, cloud-based software or a hybrid of both, as well as "as-a-service" options;


• | brand awareness and reputation;


• | strength and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts;


• | product extensibility and ability to integrate with other technologies in the network infrastructure;


• | ease of use;


• | price and total cost of ownership; and

11


• | ability to provide an orchestrated solution of products and services for detecting, preventing and resolving advanced cybersecurity threats across multiple attack vectors.

We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors as a result of the features and performance of our platform, the ease of integration of our products with network infrastructures, the breadth of our services and solution offerings and the relatively low total cost of ownership of our products. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets, deeper customer relationships, broader distribution, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We rely on, among other things, patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality safeguards and procedures, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We file patent applications to protect our intellectual property and believe that the duration of our issued patents is sufficient when considering the expected lives of our products. We cannot assure you whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will result in patents of valuable breadth or applicability. In addition, any patents that may issue may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. We also license software from third parties for integration into our products, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.
We control access to and use of our proprietary software, technology and other proprietary information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, end-customers and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright, patent and trade secret laws. Despite our efforts to protect our software, technology and other proprietary information, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software, technology and other proprietary information. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. If we become more successful, we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights. It may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our products infringe their proprietary rights. In particular, large and established companies in the IT security industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation. From time-to-time, third parties, including certain of these large companies and non-practicing entities, may assert patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners, or our end-customers, whom our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against such claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party, if any, could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services, require us to expend time and money to develop non-infringing solutions, or force us to pay substantial damages (including, in the United States, treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents), royalties or other fees. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents or other proprietary rights. For example, we are currently a party to claims alleging, among other things, patent infringement, which are in the early stages of litigation. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—Claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights could harm our business” for additional information.
Business Seasonality
For discussion of seasonal trends, see our quarterly results of operations discussion within "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 2,900 employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor organization or is a party to any collective bargaining arrangement. We have never had a work stoppage, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Facilities
We currently lease approximately 221,000 square feet of space for our corporate headquarters in Milpitas, California under lease agreements that expire during the year ended December 31, 2018. In August 2016, we entered into a lease agreement for our new corporate headquarters, expected to commence mid-2017. We maintain additional offices throughout the United States and various international locations including, Australia, Dubai, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom. We believe that these facilities are adequate to meet our ongoing needs, and that, if we require additional space, we will be able to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms.
