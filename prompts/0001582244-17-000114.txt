ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
General 
 
The Holding Company was incorporated in New York in July 2013 to serve as a holding company for the Gas Company and its dormant subsidiary, Corning Natural Gas Appliance Corporation (the “Appliance Company’). The Holding Company has 50% ownership interests in our joint ventures Leatherstocking Gas Company, LLC (“Leatherstocking Gas”), which includes its subsidiary, Leatherstocking Gas Development Corporation, and Leatherstocking Pipeline Company, LLC (“Leatherstocking Pipeline”). On August 31, 2016, the Company completed the stock purchase acquisition of Pike County Light & Power Company (“Pike”).
 
The Company’s principal executive offices are located at 330 W. William Street, Corning New York, 14830, the telephone number is (607) 936-3755, and our website is www.corninggas.com.
 
Business 
 
The Company’s primary business, through its subsidiaries Corning Gas and Pike, is natural gas and electric distribution. Corning Gas serves approximately 15,000 residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers in the Corning, Hammondsport and Virgil, New York, areas and two other gas utilities which serve the Elmira and Bath, New York, areas. It is franchised to supply gas service in all of the political subdivisions in which it operates. It also transports and compresses gas for a gas producer from the producer’s gathering network into an interstate pipeline. The Gas Company is under the jurisdiction of the New York Public Service Commission (“NYPSC”) which oversees and sets rates for New York gas distribution companies. In addition, the Gas Company has contracts with Corning Incorporated and Woodhull Municipal Gas Company, a small local utility, to provide maintenance service on their gas lines. Pike is an electric and gas utility regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (“PAPUC”). It provides electric service to approximately 4,600 customers in the Townships of Westfall, Milford and the northern part of Dingman and in the Boroughs of Milford and Matamoras. Pike provides natural gas service to 1,200 customers in Westfall Township and the Borough of Matamoras. All of these communities are located in Pike County, Pennsylvania. Additionally, Leatherstocking Gas distributes gas in Susquehanna and Bradford Counties, Pennsylvania, and has an application pending before the NYPSC for authority to provide gas distribution services in Broome County, New York. Leatherstocking Pipeline, an unregulated company, serves one customer in Lawton, Pennsylvania.
Gas and Electric Supply
 
Corning Gas has contracted with various sources to provide natural gas to our distribution system. The Gas Company contracts for pipeline capacity, as well as storage capacity of approximately 736,000 dekatherms (“Dth”). The Company manages its transportation and storage capacity with internal resources. Pike has contracted with Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (“O&R”) to provide electricity and natural gas according to agreements for a term of three years ending September 2019.
 
Corning Gas secured the NYPSC-required fixed price and storage gas supply for the 2017-2018 winter season and is managing its storage and gas supply contracts following its gas supply and acquisition plan. Assuming no extraordinary conditions for the winter season, gas supply, flowing and storage, will be adequate to serve its approximately 15,000 customers.
 
Corning Gas does not expect a shortage of natural gas to impact our business over the next five to ten years. Natural gas supply over the last several years has been positive, and domestic reserves and production have increased. This is especially true in proximity to our distribution network. We likewise anticipate no shortages of the necessary pipes and valves for safe distribution of natural gas, and continue to receive material inventory from various reliable sources. We also have confidence that our agreement with O&R will enable Pike to meet all of our electric and gas needs for Pike’s customers.
 
Seasonality
 
For both Corning Gas and Pike, business is highly seasonal in nature, sales for each quarter of the year vary and are not comparable. Sales vary depending on seasonal variations in temperature. Corning Gas and Pike’s gas sales peak in the winter, while Pike’s electric sales peak in the summer.

Significant Customers
 
The Gas Company has four major customers, Corning Incorporated, New York State Electric & Gas, Bath Electric, Gas & Water Systems, and Repsol Energy North America (“Repsol”, formerly Talisman Energy USA Incorporated). Although Repsol is a significant customer, the Gas Company does not deliver gas to Repsol. Rather the Gas Company receives gas from several of Repsol’s gathering systems and wells, and transports its gas through our system. These customers accounted for approximately 19.09% of our revenues in fiscal 2017 and 18.14% in fiscal 2016. The loss of any of these customers would have an adverse or material impact on our financial results.
Employees
 
The Company had 65 employees as of September 30, 2017, and 59 as of September 30, 2016. Of this total, nearly half are union labor working under a union contract effective until April 2, 2018.
Competition
 
Historically, the competition in the Gas Company’s residential market and Pike’s gas franchise territories has been primarily from electricity for water heating and clothes drying, and to a small degree, fuel oil and propane for heating. The price of gas remains low in comparison to that of alternative fuels in our service territories and our competitive position in the residential, commercial and industrial markets continues to be strong. When we expand our distribution system to attract new customers, our principal competition is oil and propane. Natural gas enjoys a price advantage over these fuels today.
Environmental Regulation
 
We believe we are in compliance with present federal, state and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment. We do not expect that continued compliance with these requirements will have any material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and financial position. The Company has no former manufactured gas plant sites (MGP) and is not a party to any environmental proceedings, litigation or complaints.
Regulatory Matters
 
As previously reported, on March 7, 2017, Corning Gas, the Staff of the N.Y. Department of Public Service, and Multiple Intervenors (which represents large industrial customers), signed and filed with the NYPSC, a Gas Rates Joint Proposal in Case 16-G-0369 (the “Joint Proposal”). On June 15, 2017, the NYPSC issued an Order Adopting Terms of Joint Proposal and Establishing Gas Rate Plan (the “June 2017 Order”) adopting the Joint Proposal without substantive modification.
 
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Regulatory Matters” for key terms of the
 Case 16-G-0369 Proposal.
 Pike is operating under a rate order issued effective September 1, 2014 and extended to March 1, 2018 under the terms of our acquisition (see below under the heading “Regulatory Matters – Pike”).
