Item 1. Business
History
 
We were incorporated under the name “DP Charters” in Nevada on December 18, 1997. On April 18, 2002, we changed our name to “Nomadic Collaboration International, Inc.” Effective May 30, 2003, LGC Acquisition Company, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Nomadic Collaboration International, Inc., a Nevada corporation, merged with and into LiquidGolf Corporation, a Delaware corporation, such that LiquidGolf Corporation was the surviving entity, and by virtue thereof, LiquidGolf corporation became a wholly owned subsidiary of Nomadic Collaboration. On September 29, 2003, the Company completed a re-incorporation merger into a Delaware Corporation thus changing the state of incorporation from Nevada to Delaware. As a result of the merger, the name of the Company changed to LiquidGolf Holding Corporation. Our business operations at this time became the sale of golf equipment.
 
On August 12, 2004, we determined to change the name of the Company from LiquidGolf Holding Corporation to Horizon Holding Corporation to reflect our business decision to diversify our business operations beyond the sale of golf equipment. As part of this effort, in January 2006, we purchased the Silent Sword TM software and all trademarks, service marks, and logos. On April 28, 2006 a majority of our stockholders approved changing the name of the Company from Horizon Holding Corporation to Inverted Paradigms Corporation to reflect our business direction of developing the Silent Sword TM software. Eventually we were not successful in achieving commercially viable operations in the sale of golf equipment or in the sale software. We discontinued the sale of golf equipment in August of 2006 and the sale of software in March of 2007. On October 2, 2007, we entered into an agreement with GAMI, LLC for GAMI, LLC to purchase from the Company the Silent Sword TM software and thereafter consummated the sale.
 
In September, 2007, it was determined to focus business interests on researching, developing and commercializing innovative, leading-edge technologies. On September 7, 2007, Mr. Chris Trina was hired to be our CEO to pursue this business direction and our name was changed to Transfer Technology International Corp. (“TTIN”) to reflect this business direction. In 2013, the Company changed its name to Enviro-Serv, Inc.
 
Transfer Technology
 
TTIN’s goal is to build an intellectual properties portfolio and develop commercialization strategies that will lay the groundwork for the company’s future growth. To execute this business plan, the company plans to: (1) identify, evaluate and acquire promising technologies; (2) assess the potential market for each technology and recruit likely business partners; and (3) capitalize on the technology potential through commercialization.
 
During the first quarter of 2008, TTIN acquired patents relating to two technologies. The first is a patented process for preventing flash rust on low carbon steel. The second patent is for a product that protects citrus groves from citrus canker, a disease that causes millions of dollars of crop damage each year. Both of these technologies address large markets and offer significant sales opportunities. A study by CCT Technologies estimates that rust damage costs U.S. businesses approximately $276 billion annually. Regarding citrus canker, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has spent more than $436 million since 2000 on citrus canker eradication efforts. In addition, the company is currently evaluating other patents for possible acquisition.
 
TTIN plans to research, develop and commercialize innovative, leading-edge technologies through the acquisition of licenses and the design of effective commercialization strategies in conjunction with business partners who can facilitate market penetration. The company will also help clients identify and acquire development-stage technologies and processes that can enhance the client’s business in exchange for milestone and royalty payments.

Three-fold strategy for technology acquisition
 
The company seeks to identify technologies that represent a significant advance over existing technologies, address an established market and are socially responsible. TTIN plans to pursue technology licensing opportunities in the government, academic and private sectors:
 
1.   TTIN intends to negotiate Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA) with the Department of Energy, Department of Agriculture and other federal agencies. As part of these agreements, the company will fund research and development of technologies discovered by scientists employed by these government agencies;
 
2.    In the academia market, TTIN plans to target numerous “orphaned” inventions and technology improvements. Approximately 70 percent of university patents never find a practical application or a commercial market;
 
3.  TTIN will also search for licensing opportunities in the private sector by evaluating new technologies and entering into licensing agreements with developers.
 
First two patents acquired in the first quarter of 2008:
 
Flash Off rust preventative targets corrosion market
 
Flash Off rust preventative (U.S. patent number 7,008,910) inhibits flash rusting on low carbon steel. Applications for this product include structural steel, marine vessels, offshore structures, marine terminals, cranes, bridges, storage tanks, pipelines and potable water storage tanks. Rusting and corrosion adversely affect the performance of unprotected steel and may eventually result in structural failures.
 
A study titled “Corrosion Costs and Preventive Strategies in the United States” conducted by CCT Technologies with support from the Federal Highway Administration and National Association of Corrosion Engineers estimates total direct cost of corrosion damage at $276 billion annually.
 
Canker Kill product protects citrus groves
 
Canker Kill is an environmentally-friendly spray that protects citrus groves from a group of diseases commonly known as citrus canker. ABC Research Corporation lab tested Canker Kill and found it effective against the Xanthomonas bacteria. Field tests by Glades Crop Care Inc. indicated Canker Kill was more effective than traditional copper spray treatments and much better than leaving trees untreated. Canker Kill also reduces or stops the growth of spoilage-causing micro-organisms such as Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, mold, yeast and spores. As a result, Canker Kill has potential applications in the food and beverage processing industries.
 
Citrus canker is a disease that causes lesions on the leaves, stems and fruit of citrus trees, including lime, orange and grapefruit. Eradicating canker is extremely costly and typically involves burning citrus orchard trees.
 
Our Canker Kill product contains the active ingredient d-limonene which is required to be registered for use with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”). D-limonene is already registered for a use different from ours under the herbicide label, EPA Reg No. 82052-4; 55% d-limonene. In January, 2009, the EPA led us to believe that because of the existing registration, a simple label review is all that would be required for our use of the product. To that end we named our application of d-limonene EcoAvenger Citrus Canker Control and submitted it for approval expecting a four month turn around. However, subsequent to our submission, the EPA shifted its position and insisted that it would classify our regulatory request under PRIA 2 as a new use, requiring a 15 month or longer time for review. The new additional use registration (R230) application was submitted in July, 2009, and was issued a PRIA 2 date of November 3, 2010. However, as of the date of this filing we have not received approval of our conditional use label and remain subject to the EPA’s time table.

Other Technologies and Operations
 
Organic Products International
 
The Company has begun the development of a subsidiary corporation called Organic Products International which markets organic products. We are under contract with Cutting Edge Formulations in distributing their products; Avenger Organics De-weeder, Bug and Insect killer, Bed Bug killer, kelp and granular fertilizers and nutrients.
 
Xt2000 Orange Oil and X-Terminate, Inc.
 
In about June, 2009, we were introduced to a new organic product call Xt2000 Orange Oil used for termite eradication. After becoming familiar with the product, management decided to add Xt2000 Orange Oil to its organic product line and to market the oil to licensed pest control operators in the State of Florida. In November, 2009, we went further into this market and formed a new subsidiary called Xterminate, Inc., a Florida corporation, which would take us directly into the eco-friendly pest control business of applying the oil for termite control purposes. On March 1, 2010, we opened a freestanding, full service pest control operation at 5501 54th Ave. N., St. Petersburg, Florida and have four technicians who work out of that office on an independent contractor basis. All technicians together and the subsidiary itself are licensed as wood destroying organism ID card badge holders with the state of Florida. The termite swarming season in Florida runs from May to September and represents the months of our greatest opportunity.
 
In 2011 the Company generated total revenues of $59,994. The majority of this revenue came from providing pest control services to the public. The balance came from the direct sale of our organic products.
 
Growth outlook
 
The company hopes to raise $1 million in the next 12 months for the purpose of sustaining the business operations of the Company and commercializing technologies owned by the Company. This capital will be augmented by revenues from our pest control services operation and organic products sales operation.
 
Scientific Advisory Board
 
Mr. Trina has assembled a Scientific Advisory Board for evaluating new technologies. TTIN’s expert advisors include: Dr. Sandy W. Shultz MD, Chief of Radiology at the Lower Keys Regional Medical Center in Key West Florida and Dr. David Silver.
 
Industry and Market opportunity
 
Technology transfers begin with the notion that in a world of widely distributed knowledge, companies cannot afford to rely entirely on their own research efforts, but should instead seek to acquire or license relevant processes or patents from other companies. In addition, internally developed technologies not used by the company should be monetized through licensing, joint ventures or spin-offs.
 
The transfer technology market includes virtually every university, research facility, government agency and private enterprise worldwide where new technologies are researched. This market consists of literally thousands of facilities researching tens of thousands of new technologies across a broad spectrum of industries.
 
Stanford University alone filed more than 300 patents in 2004, and has spun off technologies that helped build well-known companies such as Google, Sun Microsystems, Netscape, Cisco Systems and Yahoo. Each year, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology executes almost 100 licenses. The Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, the University of Wisconsin in Madison, and Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh have dedicated considerable resources to building productive technology transfer businesses. Universities receive hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties each year from businesses that have licensed and commercialized their inventions through technology transfers.
