OUR MARKET
 
Datawatch’s self-service data analytics platform is a critical component of the business analytics software market. Within the broader Big Data and analytics software market, Datawatch’s solutions are focused on the business intelligence and analytic tools and analytic data integration markets.


We sell and compete within the data preparation, predictive analytics and visualization markets, which are each emerging and fast-growing segments of the overall business analytics space. Over the past several years, the business analytics market has evolved from large systems implemented and managed by IT, to more agile, self-service systems owned and operated by business functions. Datawatch’s products are ideal for any combination of users, from single business analyst, to team, to entire enterprise, enabling organizations to respond rapidly to business needs with comprehensive data analysis.
 
Self-service data preparation addresses the needs of business users who are creating and analyzing data without IT intervention. Analysts must access, clean and blend data from a wide variety of systems before it can be visualized. It is estimated that up to 80% of user time is spent preparing data rather than analyzing that data, diminishing analyst productivity. Because so much time is dedicated to preparing data, it is estimated that only 12% of an organization’s data is used in business decision-making. Datawatch products enhance productivity by enabling customers to solve difficult and time-consuming data preparation challenges with simple drag-and-drop, or mouse clicks. Datawatch also facilitates and enables IT’s data governance needs by centralizing and controlling access to data and curated data assets. Furthermore, Datawatch solutions can be deployed at any scale across an entire enterprise, on premise as well as in ‘the cloud.’
 
The visual data discovery market continues to evolve with new requirements that make Datawatch’s solutions more relevant. While ease of use remains a critical factor in the adoption of visualization technologies, successful platforms today must also offer users the ability to develop visualizations and acquire, prepare, automate and manage any source of data used in visual data discovery applications. Datawatch’s extensive experience in these areas, as well as other growing outlets such as social media, enables users to attain high value results for many mission critical purposes. For example, the increased use of NoSQL data and other multi-structured sources, coupled with the desire for a more manageable and governed deployment of visualization solutions, are also driving additional changes in industries such as capital markets, government, retail, and telecommunications.
 
OUR PRODUCTS
 
The Datawatch product family enables businesses to maximize the ability to analyze all of their information assets, regardless of the form in which that data exists. Moreover, the Datawatch Monarch product family spans the needs from a single user working at a desktop through a workgroup, team or business unit and can scale all the way to an enterprise-wide platform server delivering prepared data to thousands of users, internal and external. With high levels of governance controls embedded in the Datawatch product family, decisions about which users can access what data and integration with other platforms, such as Tableau Server, IBM Watson Analytics or a data warehouse, are simple. Datawatch Monarch and Swarm self-service data preparation solutions are the first step in unlocking value from data contained in a wide variety of sources. Datawatch Panopticon enables real-time visualization of streaming data for fast data analysis. Datawatch Angoss solutions enables citizen data scientists to build predictive models in an easy graphical user interface, requiring no coding or scripting.
 
Our principal product line of solutions includes the following:

MARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY
 
We market and sell our products and services through our direct sales force, a distribution channel and an indirect sales channel comprised of a global partner network. Our direct sales force consists of professional sales and pre-sales personnel who typically have several years of experience selling and demonstrating enterprise software solutions. Our distribution channel is predominantly for our Datawatch Monarch product and consists of a single tier reselling network. Our global partner network brings significant technological and industry expertise, as well as added geographic presence, that enable us to reach customer organizations around the world. These indirect sales channels often help to shorten sales cycles with prospective customers.
 
Our global partner network includes system integrators, technology alliance partners and strategic, geographic and product-specific resellers. Resellers are typically authorized to sell licenses, implement and, in some instances, provide first line support for our software products. System integrators, technology alliance partners, implementation partners and referral partners may also sell licenses and provide complementary skills, domain or industry experience, as well as expanded local, national or global geographic coverage.
 
Our global partner network also includes original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partners and value-added reseller (“VAR”) partners who use our technologies as embedded or bundled add-on features in their products and services. Typically, OEM and VAR partners include software companies, SaaS vendors and information providers. More broadly, this category includes any organization seeking to leverage Datawatch products to access and analyze semi-structured and unstructured data for use in an existing or new product or in a service offering. We support these business relationships with development and business resources to ensure that Datawatch products are optimized and certified for leading technology platforms, allowing our customers to benefit from these expanded solutions with seamless integration. Selected partners include organizations such as Tableau, IBM, Sage, Baker Tilly and Dell.
 
We support our global partner network in three primary ways:
 

· | enabling partners through sales training, demonstration training, technical support and education; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | marketing with and for partners through lead generation programs, customer marketing and awareness; and, 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | positioning and selling Datawatch products with effective sales tools and sales support. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As of September 30, 2018, our global partner network was comprised of nearly 100 partners worldwide. No one partner or customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the year ended September 30, 2018 or 2016. One partner accounted for 12% of total revenue for the year ended September 30, 2017.
 
Our software products are sold under warranty against certain defects in material and workmanship. If necessary, we would provide for the estimated cost of warranties based on specific warranty claims and claim history. However, we have never incurred significant expense under our product or service warranties. As a result, we believe our exposure related to these warranty agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded for warranty claims as of September 30, 2018 and 2017.
 
Our go-to-market approach includes a blend of expanding our penetration within existing customers and securing new customers through a ‘land and expand’ sales model. Our marketing efforts are focused on generating qualified sales leads for our direct sales force and our global partners, increasing brand awareness, communicating our positioning in the market and promoting product advantages. We rely on a variety of marketing initiatives to achieve our goals. In addition, we work closely with our global partners on co-marketing and lead generation initiatives to broaden our marketing reach.
 
Our revenues from outside of the United States primarily reflect sales through the direct sales force of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Angoss Software Corporation, which is located in Canada, Angoss Software Limited, which is located in the United Kingdom, Datawatch International Limited, which is located in the United Kingdom, and its subsidiaries which are located in Germany, Singapore and Australia, and Datawatch AB, which is located in Sweden, as well as through international resellers. Such international sales represented 20%, 17% and 14% of our total revenue for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Further geographic information is included in Note 9, “Segment Information and Revenue by Geographic Location,” to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 
OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS
 
We are committed to leading our sector in innovation, as evidenced by our recent launch of next generation Monarch Swarm as well as updated releases of both Monarch Server and Panopticon. We believe that timely development of new products and enhancements to our existing products are essential in a dynamic market to respond to new customer challenges and new types of data. We intend to continue to invest significant amounts in research and product development to ensure that our products meet our customers’ current and future demands as well as to take advantage of evolving technology trends.
 
Our product managers work closely with developers, whether independent or in-house, to define product specifications. The initial concept for a product originates from this cooperative effort.  The developer is generally responsible for coding the development project. Our product managers maintain close technical control over the products, giving us the freedom to designate which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. The product managers and staff work in parallel with developers to produce printed documentation, on-line help files, tutorials and installation software. In some cases, we may subcontract a portion of this work on a project basis to third-party suppliers under contracts. Our personnel also perform extensive quality assurance testing for all products and coordinate external beta test programs.
 
Datawatch products have been developed through in-house software development, by offshore software development companies hired under contract or by acquisition. We maintain source code and full product control for these products.
 
Our total engineering and product development expense was $11.4 million, $8.9 million and $8.2 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

OUR COMPETITION
 
Datawatch’s self-service data preparation, predictive analytics and visual data discovery software competes within the broad and highly competitive business analytics market and specifically the data visualization market. While we believe that there is no single competitor that addresses the full range of capabilities of our software, we face competition from several companies that are offering, or soon may offer, products that compete with portions or aspects of our software.
 
Competitors can be classified into four broad categories:
 

· | Large software companies, including suppliers of traditional business intelligence products that provide one or more capabilities that are competitive with our products, such as IBM, Microsoft, SAS, Oracle and SAP. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | New and emerging vendors focused more specifically on data preparation, such as Informatica, Alteryx, Paxata and Trifacta. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Business analytics vendors focused on real-time visualization, such as First Derivatives and Zoomdata. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Independent vendors that focus on extracting specific data formats or sources such as machine data, data in content management systems, EDI, XBRL, HTML and PDFs. These competitors include Splunk, Actuate (Xenos) and Informatica, among others. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 We believe that generally, we compete favorably with respect to these companies and competitive offerings; however, some current and potential competitors have advantages over us, including:
 

· | longer operating histories, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


· | significantly greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources, 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | stronger brand and business user recognition, and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | broader global distribution and presence. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Competition in our industry is likely to intensify as current competitors expand their product lines and as new competitors enter the market.
 
OUR EMPLOYEES
 
As of September 30, 2018, we had 188 full-time and 1 part-time employees, including 74 engaged in marketing and sales; 36 engaged in product consulting, training and technical support; 55 engaged in product management, development and quality assurance; and 24 providing general, administrative, accounting, IT and software production and warehousing functions.
OTHER BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS
 
Product Protection
 
We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our rights to such proprietary technology. With respect to patents, on June 30, 2015, we applied with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for U.S. patent protection of our proprietary systems and methods for automatically generating tables using auto-generated templates. This application is currently pending. Moreover, on January 12, 2016, we applied with the USPTO for U.S. patent protection of our proprietary systems and methods for generating tables from print-ready digital source documents. A first patent (U.S. Patent No. 9,703,706) was issued in this case on July 11, 2017, and a continuation application is pending. In addition, we may from time to time apply for additional patents with the USPTO to protect other proprietary systems and methods of our technology. Despite these precautions, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We believe that, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the software industry, the legal protections for our products are less significant than the knowledge, ability and experience of our employees and developers, the frequency of product enhancements and the timeliness and quality of our support services. We believe that none of our products, trademarks, and other proprietary rights infringes on the proprietary rights of third parties, but there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future.

Backlog
 
Our software products are generally shipped within three business days of receipt of an order. Accordingly, we do not believe that backlog for our product is a meaningful indicator of future business. We do maintain a backlog of services commitments primarily related to Datawatch Monarch Server and Datawatch Report Manager On-Demand business. While this services backlog will provide future revenue to Datawatch, we believe that it is not a meaningful indicator of future business.
