Item 1.    Business
Form of Organization
The Company was established as a local investment banking firm in 1971 and began operations as a retail discount securities brokerage firm in 1975. The parent company is a Delaware corporation.
Operations
We are a leading provider of securities brokerage services and related technology-based financial services to retail clients and independent registered investment advisors ("RIAs"). We provide our services to individual retail investors and traders, and RIAs predominantly through the Internet, a national branch network and relationships with RIAs. We use our platform to offer brokerage services to retail investors and traders under a simple, low-cost commission structure and brokerage custodial services to RIAs.
We have been an innovator in electronic brokerage services since entering the retail securities brokerage business in 1975. We believe that we were the first brokerage firm to offer the following products and services to retail clients: touch-tone trading; trading over the Internet; mobile trading; unlimited, streaming, free real-time quotes; extended trading hours; direct access to market destinations; commitment on the speed of order execution and trading via chatbot and voice commands. Over the years the number of brokerage accounts, RIA relationships, average daily trading volume and total assets in client accounts have substantially increased. We have also built, and continue to invest in, a proprietary trade processing platform that is both cost-efficient and highly scalable, significantly lowering our operating costs per trade. In addition, we have made significant investments in building the TD Ameritrade brand.
Strategy
We intend to capitalize on the growth and consolidation of the retail brokerage industry in the United States and leverage our low-cost infrastructure to grow our market share and profitability. Our long-term growth strategy is to increase our market share of total assets in client accounts, while maintaining a leadership position in client trading, by providing superior offerings to retail investors and traders, and RIAs. We strive to enhance the client experience by providing asset management products and services, enhanced trading tools and capabilities and a superior, proprietary, single-platform system to support RIAs. The key elements of our strategy are as follows:

• | Focus on brokerage services. We continue to focus on attracting retail investors and traders, and RIAs to our brokerage services. This focused strategy is designed to enable us to maintain our low operating cost structure while offering our clients outstanding products and services. We primarily route orders for execution of client trades on an agency, rather than a principal, basis. We maintain an inventory of fixed income securities to meet client demand. 


• | Provide a comprehensive investor solution. We continue to expand our suite of diversified investment products and services to best serve investors' needs. We help clients make investment decisions by providing investment tools, guidance, education and objective third-party research at levels that meet the needs of our clients. 


• | Continue to be a leader in the RIA industry. We provide RIAs with comprehensive brokerage and custody services supported by our robust integrated technology platform, customized personal service and practice management solutions. 


• | Leverage our infrastructure to add incremental revenue. Through our proprietary technology, we are able to provide a robust online experience for retail investors and traders. Our low-cost, scalable systems provide speed, reliability and quality trade execution services for clients. The scalable capacity of our trading system

allows us to process a significant number of additional transactions while incurring minimal additional fixed costs.

• | Continue to be a low-cost provider of quality services. We achieve low operating costs per trade by creating economies of scale, utilizing our proprietary transaction-processing systems, continuing to automate processes and locating much of our operations in low-cost geographical areas. This low fixed-cost infrastructure provides us with significant financial flexibility. In addition, our bank deposit account arrangements with The Toronto-Dominion Bank ("TD") and other third-party financial institutions enable our clients to invest in an FDIC-insured deposit product without the need for the Company to establish the significant levels of capital that would be required to maintain our own bank charter. 


• | Continue to differentiate our offerings through innovative technologies and service enhancements. We have been an innovator in our industry for over 40 years. We continually strive to provide our clients with the ability to customize their investing and trading experience. We provide our clients greater choice by offering features and functionality to meet their specific needs. 


• | Leverage the TD Ameritrade brand. We believe that we have a superior brand identity and that our advertising has established TD Ameritrade as a leading brand in the retail brokerage market. 


• | Continue to evaluate opportunities for growth through acquisitions. When evaluating potential acquisitions, we look for transactions that will give us operational leverage, technological leverage, increased market share or other strategic opportunities. 

On September 18, 2017, we completed our acquisition of the brokerage business of Scottrade Financial Services, Inc. ("Scottrade"), a Delaware corporation. The transaction combined highly complementary franchises and added significant scale to our retail business with the addition of approximately 3.5 million funded client accounts, extended our leadership in trading, and expanded the size of our branch network. For additional information regarding this acquisition, see Note 2 - Business Acquisition under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We earn commissions and transaction fees on client trades in common and preferred stock, ETFs, exchange-traded notes, closed-end funds, options, futures, foreign exchange, mutual funds, fixed income securities and annuities. Order routing revenue generated from payments or rebates received from market centers is a component of commissions and transaction fees. Margin lending, securities borrowed and loaned transactions and client cash generate net interest revenue. Cash management services generate bank deposit account fees. Fees earned from mutual funds, investment program fees and referrals generate investment product fee revenues. Other revenues include proxy income, solicit and tender fees and other fees charged for ancillary services provided to clients. The following table presents the percentage of net revenues contributed by each class of similar services during the last three fiscal years:

 | Percentage of Net RevenuesFiscal Year Ended September 30,

We provide our clients with an array of channels to access our products and services. These include the Internet, our network of retail branches, mobile trading applications, interactive voice response and registered representatives via telephone.
Client Service and Support
We strive to provide the best client service in the industry as measured by: (1) speed of response time to telephone calls, (2) turnaround time responding to client inquiries and (3) client satisfaction with the account relationship.
We endeavor to optimize our client service by:

• | Ensuring prompt response to client service calls through adequate staffing with properly trained and motivated personnel in our client service departments, a majority of whom hold the Series 7 license;


• | Tailoring client service to the particular expectations of clients; and


• | Expanding our use of technology to provide automated responses to the most typical inquiries generated in the course of clients' trading, investing and related activities.

We provide client service and support through the following means:

• | Websites. Our websites provide information on how to use our services, a variety of self-service capabilities and an in-depth education center that includes a selection of online investing courses. Clients also have access to a virtual agent that enables them to ask questions about our products, tools and services, as well as access to live agents through chat capabilities. 


• | Branches. We offer a nationwide network of retail branch offices, with more than 360 retail branches located in 48 states and the District of Columbia. 


• | Email. Clients are encouraged to use email to contact our client service representatives. Our operating standards require a response within 24 hours of receipt of the email; however, we strive to respond within four hours after receiving the original message. 


• | Telephone. For clients who choose to call or whose inquiries necessitate calling one of our client service representatives, we provide a toll-free number that connects to advanced call handling systems. These systems provide automated answering and directing of calls to the proper department. Our systems also allow linkage between caller identification and the client database to give the client service representative

immediate access to the client's account data when the call is received. Client service representatives are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

• | TTY services for the hearing impaired. To ensure effective communication in connection with the provision of financial services, we provide sign language and oral interpreters and/or other auxiliary aids and services free of charge for the hearing impaired. 


• | Mobile app. Support on our TD Ameritrade Mobile Trader App allows clients to text with a trading specialist for immediate answers to their questions or share their screen for help with navigating the app. 

Technology and Information Systems
Our technological capabilities and systems are central to our business and are critical to our goal of providing the best execution at the best value to our clients. Our operations require reliable, scalable systems that can handle complex financial transactions for our clients with speed and accuracy. We maintain sophisticated and proprietary technology that automates traditionally labor-intensive securities transactions. Our ability to effectively leverage and adopt new technology to improve our services is a key component of our success.
We continue to make investments in technology and information systems. We have spent a significant amount of resources to increase capacity and improve speed, reliability and security. To provide for system continuity during potential power outages, we have equipped our data centers with uninterruptible power supply units and back-up generators.
Advertising and Marketing
We intend to continue to grow and increase our market share by advertising online, on television, in print, on our own websites, and utilizing various forms of social media. We invest heavily in advertising programs designed to bring greater brand recognition to our services, and we intend to continue to aggressively advertise. From time to time, we may choose to increase our advertising to target specific groups of investors or to increase or decrease advertising in response to market conditions.
Advertising for retail clients is generally conducted through digital, search and social media, financial news networks and other television and cable networks. We also place print advertisements in a broad range of business publications. Advertising for institutional clients is significantly less than for retail clients and is generally conducted through highly-targeted media.
To monitor the success of our various marketing efforts, we utilize a media mix model that uses robust data sets to analyze the return on investment of our marketing channels. This model also supports decisions on spending levels and helps us determine the point at which we begin to experience diminishing returns. Additionally, our advanced data and analytics capabilities enable a more targeted, personalized experience for prospective and existing clients. How we share client information is disclosed in our privacy statement.
All of our securities brokerage-related communications with the public are regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"). All of our futures and foreign exchange brokerage-related communications with the public are regulated by the National Futures Association ("NFA").
Clearing Operations
Our subsidiary, TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc. ("TDAC"), provides clearing and execution services for our securities brokerage business. Clearing services include the confirmation, receipt, settlement, delivery and record-keeping functions involved in processing securities transactions. TDAC provides the following back office functions:

• | Maintaining client accounts;


• | Extending credit in a margin account to the client;


• | Engaging in securities lending and borrowing transactions;


• | Settling securities transactions with clearinghouses such as The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation and The Options Clearing Corporation;

• | Processing cash sweep transactions to and from bank deposit accounts and money market mutual funds;


• | Transmitting tax accounting information to the client and to the applicable tax authority; and


• | Forwarding prospectuses, proxy materials and other shareholder information to clients.

We contract with external providers for futures clearing. We also contract with an external provider to facilitate foreign exchange trading for our clients.
Competition
We believe that the principal determinants of success in the retail brokerage market are brand recognition, size of client base and client assets, ability to attract new clients and client assets, client trading activity, efficiency of operations, technology infrastructure and advancements and access to financial resources. We also believe that the principal factors considered by clients in choosing a brokerage firm are reputation, client service quality, price, convenience, product offerings, quality of trade execution, platform capabilities, innovation and overall value. Based on our experience, focus group research and the success we have enjoyed to date, we believe that we presently compete successfully in each of these categories.
The market for brokerage services, particularly electronic brokerage services, continues to evolve and is highly competitive. We experience significant competition and expect this competitive environment to continue. We encounter direct competition from numerous other brokerage firms, many of which provide online brokerage services. These competitors include E*TRADE Financial Corporation, The Charles Schwab Corporation and Fidelity Investments. We also encounter competition from the broker-dealer affiliates of established full-commission brokerage firms, such as Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, as well as from banks, mutual fund sponsors, online wealth management services (including so-called "robo-advisors") and other financial institutions and organizations, some of which provide online brokerage services.
Regulation
The securities, futures and foreign exchange industries are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state law. Our broker-dealers, TD Ameritrade, Inc. and TDAC, are required to register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and to be members of FINRA and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board ("MSRB"). Our futures commission merchant ("FCM") and forex dealer member ("FDM") subsidiary, TD Ameritrade Futures & Forex LLC ("TDAFF"), is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") and is a member of, and the corresponding services functions are regulated by, the NFA. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") relating to broker-dealers, including, among other things, minimum net capital requirements under the SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1), best execution requirements for client trades under SEC guidelines and FINRA rules and segregation of client funds under the SEC Customer Protection Rule (Rule 15c3-3), administered by the SEC and FINRA. TDAFF is subject to regulations under the Commodity Exchange Act, administered by the CFTC and NFA, including CFTC Regulations 1.17 and 5.7, which require the maintenance of minimum adjusted net capital, and CFTC Regulation 1.20, which requires segregation of client funds.
Net capital rules are designed to protect clients, counterparties and creditors by requiring a broker-dealer, an FCM or an FDM to have sufficient liquid resources available to satisfy its financial obligations. Net capital is a measure of a broker-dealer's, an FCM's or an FDM's readily available liquid assets, reduced by its total liabilities other than approved subordinated debt. Under the Uniform Net Capital Rule, a broker-dealer may not repay any subordinated borrowings, pay cash dividends or make any unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in a net capital amount below required levels. Broker-dealers are required to provide notice to the SEC and FINRA if their net capital is below certain required levels. Likewise, a FCM and FDM, such as TDAFF, must provide notice to the CFTC if its adjusted net capital amounts are below required levels.

Certain of our subsidiaries are also registered as investment advisors under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. We are also subject to regulation in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, including registration requirements. TD Ameritrade Trust Company is chartered in the state of Maine as a state-regulated non-depository trust company.
In its capacity as a securities clearing firm, TDAC is a member of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation ("DTCC") and The Options Clearing Corporation ("OCC"), each of which is registered as a clearing agency with the SEC. As a member of these clearing agencies, TDAC is required to comply with the rules of such clearing agencies, including rules relating to possession or control of client funds and securities, margin lending and execution and settlement of transactions.
Margin lending activities are subject to limitations imposed by regulations of the Federal Reserve System and FINRA. In general, these regulations provide that, in the event of a significant decline in the value of securities collateralizing a margin account, we are required to obtain additional collateral from the borrower or liquidate security positions.
We are subject to a number of state, federal and foreign laws applicable to companies conducting business on the Internet that address client privacy, system security and safeguarding practices and the use of client information.
For additional, important information relating to government regulation, please review the information set forth under the heading "Risk Factors Relating to the Regulatory and Legislative Environment" in Item 1A — Risk Factors.
Risk Management
Our business activities expose us to various risks. Identifying and measuring our risks is critical to our ability to manage risk within acceptable tolerance levels in order to minimize the effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our management team is responsible for managing risk, and it is overseen by our board of directors, primarily through the board's Risk Committee. We use risk management processes and have policies and procedures for identifying, measuring and managing risks, including establishing threshold levels for our most significant risks. Our risk management, compliance, internal audit, and legal departments assist management in identifying and managing risks. Our management team's Enterprise Risk Committee ("ERC") is responsible for reviewing risk exposures and risk mitigation. Subcommittees of the ERC have been established to assist in identifying and managing specific areas of risk.
Our business exposes us to the following broad categories of risk:
Operational Risk — Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or controls, human error or misconduct, systems and technology problems or from external events. It also involves compliance with regulatory and legal requirements. Operational risk is the most prevalent form of risk in our risk profile. We manage operational risk by establishing policies and procedures to accomplish timely and efficient processing, obtaining periodic internal control attestations from management and conducting internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls.
Cyber Security Risk — Cyber security risk is the risk of a malicious technological attack intended to impact the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of our systems and data, including sensitive client data. Our technology and security teams rely on a layered system of preventive and detective technologies, practices, and policies to detect, mitigate, and neutralize cyber security threats. Cyber-attacks can also result in financial and reputational risk.
Market Risk — Market risk is the risk of loss resulting from adverse movements in market factors, such as asset prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Our market risk related to asset prices is mitigated by our routing for execution of client trades primarily on an agency, rather than a principal, basis and our maintenance of fixed-income securities to meet client requirements. Interest rate risk is our most prevalent form of market risk. For more information about our interest rate risk and how we manage it, see Item 7A — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
10


Credit Risk — Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from failure of obligors to honor their payments. Our exposure to credit risk mainly arises from client margin lending and leverage activities, securities lending activities and other counterparty credit risks. For more information about our credit risk and how we manage it, see Item 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Liquidity Risk — Liquidity risk is the risk of loss resulting from the inability to meet current and future cash flow needs. We actively monitor our liquidity position at the holding company and at the broker-dealer and FCM/FDM subsidiary levels. For more information, see Item 7 — Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Strategic Risk — Strategic risk is the risk of loss arising from ineffective business strategies, improper implementation of business strategies, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the business and competitive environment. Our executive management is responsible for establishing an appropriate corporate strategy intended to create value for stockholders, clients and employees, with oversight by our board of directors. Our management is responsible for defining the priorities, initiatives and resources necessary to execute the strategic plan, the success of which is regularly evaluated by the board of directors.
Reputational Risk — Reputational risk is the risk arising from possible negative perceptions, whether true or not, of the Company among our clients, counterparties, stockholders, suppliers, employees and regulators. The potential for either enhancing or damaging our reputation is inherent in almost all aspects of business activity. We manage this risk through our commitment to a set of core values that emphasize and reward high standards of ethical behavior, maintaining a culture of compliance and by being responsive to client and regulatory requirements.
Risk is inherent in our business, and therefore, despite our efforts to manage risk, there can be no assurance that we will not sustain unexpected losses. For a discussion of the factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results of operations, see Item 1A — Risk Factors.
Intellectual Property Rights
Our success and ability to compete are significantly dependent on our intellectual property. We rely on copyright, trade secret, trademark, domain name, patent and contract laws to protect our intellectual property and have utilized the various methods available to us, including filing applications for patents and trademark registrations with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and entering into written licenses and other technology agreements with third parties. Our patented and patent pending technologies include stock indexing and investor education technologies, as well as innovative trading and analysis tools. Our trademarks include both our primary brand, TD Ameritrade (including the "TD" name through trademark license agreement with The Toronto-Dominion Bank), as well as brands for other products and services. A substantial portion of our intellectual property is protected by trade secrets. The source and object code for our proprietary software is also protected using applicable methods of intellectual property protection and general protections afforded to confidential information. In addition, it is our policy to enter into confidentiality and intellectual property ownership agreements with our employees and confidentiality and noncompetition agreements with our independent contractors and business partners and to control access to and distribution of our intellectual property.
Employees
As of September 30, 2018, we had 9,183 full-time equivalent employees. None of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. 
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
We primarily operate in the securities brokerage industry and have no other reportable segments. Substantially all of our revenues from external clients for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were derived from our operations in the United States.
