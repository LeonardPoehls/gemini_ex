ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Amyris, Inc. (the Company or Amyris) is a leading industrial biotechnology company that applies its technology platform to engineer, manufacture and sell high performance, natural, sustainably sourced products into the Health & Wellness, Clean Skincare, and Flavors & Fragrances markets. Our proven technology platform enables us to rapidly engineer microbes and use them as catalysts to metabolize renewable, plant-sourced sugars into large volume, high-value ingredients. Our biotechnology platform and industrial fermentation process replace existing complex and expensive manufacturing processes. We have successfully used our technology to develop and produce five distinct molecules at commercial volumes.
 
We believe that industrial synthetic biology represents a third industrial revolution, bringing together biology and engineering to generate new, more sustainable materials to meet the growing global demand for bio-based replacements for petroleum-based and traditional animal- or plant-derived ingredients. We continue to build demand for our current portfolio of products through an extensive sales network provided by our collaboration partners that represent the world's leading companies for our target market sectors. We also have a small group of direct sales and distributors who support our Clean Skincare market. With our partnership model, our partners invest in the development of each molecule to bring it from the lab to commercial scale and use their extensive sales force to sell our ingredients and formulations to their customers as part of their core business. We capture long-term revenue both through the production and sale of the molecule to our partners and through royalty revenues (previously referred to as value share) from our partners' product sales to their customers.
 
We were founded in 2003 in the San Francisco Bay area by a group of scientists from the University of California, Berkeley. Our first major milestone came in 2005 when, through a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we developed technology capable of creating microbial strains that produce artemisinic acid, which is a precursor of artemisinin, an effective anti-malarial drug. In 2008, we granted royalty-free licenses to allow Sanofi-Aventis to produce artemisinic acid using our technology. Building on our success with artemisinic acid, in 2007 we began applying our technology platform to develop, manufacture and sell sustainable alternatives to a broad range of markets.
 
We focused our initial development efforts primarily on the production of Biofene®, our brand of renewable farnesene, a long-chain, branched hydrocarbon molecule that we manufacture through fermentation using engineered microbes. Our farnesene derivatives are sold in hundreds of products as nutraceuticals, skincare products, fragrances, solvents, polymers, and lubricant ingredients. The commercialization of farnesene pushed us to create a more cost efficient, faster and accurate development process in the lab and drive manufacturing costs down. This investment has enabled our technology platform to rapidly develop microbial strains and commercialize target molecules. In 2014, we began manufacturing additional molecules for the Flavors & Fragrances industry; in 2015 we began investing to expand our capabilities to other small molecule chemical classes beyond terpenes via our collaboration with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and in 2016 we expanded into proteins.
 
We have invested over $500 million in infrastructure and technology to create microbes that produce molecules from sugar or other feedstocks at commercial scale. This platform has been used to design, build, optimize, and upscale strains producing five distinct molecules, leading to more than 15 commercial ingredients used in over 600 consumer products. Our time to market for molecules has decreased from seven years to less than a year for our most recent molecule, mainly due to our ability to leverage the technology platform we have built.
 
Our technology platform has been in active use since 2008 and has been integrated with our commercial production since 2011, creating an organism development process that we believe makes us an industry leader in the successful scale-up and commercialization of biotech-produced ingredients. The key performance characteristics of our platform that we believe differentiate us include our proprietary computational tools, strain construction tools, screening and analytics tools, and advanced lab automation and data integration. Having this fully integrated with our large scale manufacturing process and capability enables us to always engineer with the end specification and requirements guiding our technology. Our state-of-the-art infrastructure includes industry-leading strain engineering and lab automation located in Emeryville, California, pilot scale production facilities in Emeryville, California and Campinas, Brazil, a demonstration-scale facility in Campinas, Brazil and a commercial-scale production facility in Leland, North Carolina, which is owned and operated by our Aprinnova joint venture to convert our Biofene into squalane and other final products.

We are able to use a wide variety of feedstocks for production, but have focused on accessing Brazilian sugarcane for our large-scale production because of its renewability, low cost and relative price stability. We have also successfully used other feedstocks such as sugar beets, corn dextrose, sweet sorghum and cellulosic sugars at various manufacturing facilities.
 
Several years ago, we made the strategic decision to transition our business model from collaborating and commercializing molecules in low margin commodity markets to higher margin specialty markets. We began the transition by first commercializing and supplying farnesene-derived squalene as a cosmetic ingredient sold to formulators and distributors. We also entered into collaboration and supply agreements for the development and commercialization of molecules within the Flavors & Fragrances and Cosmetic Ingredients where we utilize our strain generation technology to develop molecules that meet our customers' rigorous specifications.
 
During this transition, we solidified the business model of partnering with our customers to create sustainable, high performing, low-cost molecules that replace an ingredient in their supply chain, commercially scale and manufacture those molecules, and share in the profits earned by our customers once our customer sells its product into these specialty markets. These three steps constitute our collaboration revenues, renewable product revenues, and royalty revenues (previously referred to as value share revenues).
 
During 2017, we completed several development agreements with DSM and others for new products such as Vitamin A, a human nutrition molecule and others. We plan to bring two to three new molecules a year to commercial production.
 
In the first half of 2017, management made the decision to monetize the use for one of our lower margin molecules, farnesene, in certain fields of use (e.g., the human and animal health and nutrition field) while retaining any associated royalties. We began discussions with our partners and ultimately made the decision to license farnesene to DSM for use in these fields, which we announced in November 2017. During the discussions with DSM, management also made the decision to sell to DSM our manufacturing facility, Brotas 1, which we completed on December 28, 2017.
 
Brotas 1 was built to batch manufacture one commodity product at a time (originally for high-volume production of biofuels, a business the Company has exited), which is an inefficient manufacturing process that is not suited for the high margin specialty markets in which we operate today. We currently manufacture five specialty products and will be increasing the number of specialty products we manufacture by two to three products a year. The inefficiencies we experienced included having to idle the facility for two weeks at a time to prepare for the next product batch manufacture. These inefficiencies caused our cost of goods sold to be significantly higher. With the sale of Brotas 1, we expect that our gross margins will markedly improve from the reduction in manufacturing costs caused by these inefficiencies. Additionally, we currently are constructing our Brotas 2 facility, which will allow for the manufacture of five products concurrently and over 10 different products annually. Concurrent with the sale of Brotas 1, we contracted with DSM for the use of Brotas 1 to manufacture products for us to fulfill our product supply commitments to our customers until Brotas 2 is completed in 2019. In addition, in 2019, we plan to resume construction of a production facility in Pradópolis, Brazil that we partially built prior to 2013. This facility would support production of our alternative sweetener products.
 
As discussed above, on December 28, 2017, we completed the sale of Amyris Brasil, which operated our Brotas 1 production facility, to DSM and concurrently entered into a series of commercial agreements and a credit agreement with DSM. At closing, we received $33.0 million in cash for the capital stock of Amyris Brasil, which is subject to certain post-closing working capital adjustments and reimbursements from DSM contingent on DSM’s utilization of certain Brazilian tax benefits it acquired with its purchase of Amyris Brasil. We used $12.6 million of the cash proceeds received to repay certain indebtedness of Amyris Brasil. The total fair value of the consideration in connection with the sales agreement for Amyris Brasil was $56.9 million and resulted in a pretax gain of $5.7 million from continuing operations.

Concurrent with the sale of Amyris Brasil, we entered into a series of commercial agreements with DSM including (i) a license agreement to DSM of its farnesene product for DSM to use in the Vitamin E, lubricant, and Flavors & Fragrances specialty markets; (ii) a value share agreement that DSM will pay specified royalties representing a portion of the profit on the sale of Vitamin E produced from farnesene under the Nenter Supply Agreement assigned to DSM; (iii) a performance agreement to perform research and development to optimize farnesene for production and sale of farnesene products; and (iv) a transition services agreement where we provide finance, legal, logistics, and human resource services to support the Brotas 1 facility under DSM ownership for a six-month period with a DSM option to extend for six additional months. At closing, DSM paid to us a nonrefundable license fee of $27.5 million and a nonrefundable minimum royalty revenue payment (previously referred to as value share) of $15.0 million. DSM will also pay the Company nonrefundable minimum royalty amounts in 2018 and 2019. The future nonrefundable minimum annual royalty payments were determined to be fixed and determinable with a fair value of $17.8 million, and were included as part of the total arrangement consideration subject to allocation of this overall multiple-element divestiture transaction. See Note 10, “Significant Revenue Agreements”, for a full listing and details of agreements entered into with DSM. Additionally, we entered into a $25.0 million credit agreement with DSM that we used to repay all outstanding amounts under the Guanfu Note (see Note 4, “Debt”).
 
Technology
 
We have developed innovative microbial engineering and screening technologies that allow us to transform the way microbes metabolize sugars. Specifically, we engineer microbes, such as yeast, and use them as catalysts to convert sugar, through fermentation, into high-value molecules. In 2015, we were awarded an investment by The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to expand the capabilities of our technology platform beyond terpenoids. The investment has resulted in us developing an integrated platform with artificial intelligence that will speed up the development and commercialization of small molecules across 15 different chemical classes. We have also developed our technology to be able to produce large molecules, such as proteins.
 
We devote substantial resources to our research and development efforts. As of December 31, 2017, our research and development organization included 158 employees, 109 of whom held Ph.D.s. We have invested more than $500 million to date in our research and development capabilities that has resulted in an almost 6X improvement in speed to market and 24X improvement in cost of manufacturing. These achievements are due to the leading strain engineering and upscaling/commercialization capabilities we have developed from our investment.
 
Strain Engineering
 
Companies and researchers around the world are continuously learning how the complex biological processes in organisms work. Because there is so much that is still unknown, the best method for development of commercially viable strains is to test as many hypotheses as accurately and quickly as possible to accelerate the learning curve.
 
We have developed a high-throughput strain engineering system that is currently capable of producing and screening more than 100,000 yeast strains per month, which enables us to achieve an approximately 95% lower cost per strain than we achieved in 2009. We generated more than 360,000 unique strains in 2017, surpassing 6.3 million unique strains created since our inception, with each strain testing for improved production of the target molecules. In addition, through our lab-scale and pilot-plant fermentation operations, and our proprietary analytical tools, we are now able to predict, with high reliability, the performance of candidate strains at industrial scale.

Upscaling and Commercialization
 
The riskiest part of commercializing biotechnology is often the scale up and manufacturing due to the perceived unpredictability of biotechnology at different scales. We have built scale up capabilities and manufacturing as our advantage by heavily investing in prediction models and analytics to quickly ascertain how a strain’s behavior at one scale will translate in another scale and also by successfully scaling up and manufacturing five distinct molecules to date. The results of our advantage are accelerated speed to market, lower overall development costs, and a significantly lower risk profile for any project we undertake.
 
A strain must be improved to increase the level of efficiency of production, and tested for performance in larger-volume facilities, before it is implemented at commercial-scale manufacturing facilities. Our unique infrastructure to support this scale-up process includes lab-scale fermenters (0.5 to 2 liter), operating pilot plants in our facilities in Emeryville, California and Campinas, Brazil (300 liters), two 5,000-liter fermenters in our Campinas demonstration facility and five years’ experience owning and operating our 1,200,000-liter production facility in Brotas, Brazil. Each of these stages mimic the conditions found in larger scale fermentation so that our findings may translate predictably from lab scale to pilot and ultimately to commercial scale. Our infrastructure is so accurate that we can go straight from lab scale to commercial scale for our fermentations. Typically, the only reason we ever invest in the pilot scale step is to produce enough product to accurately test our downstream processing since our fermentation process is already robust.
 
The complexities that can arise at industrial scale manufacturing are significant and it takes an experienced team to not only address issues as they arise, but to also have the foresight to prevent issues from arising. With five years of experience operating our production facility in Brotas, Brazil that we designed, we have been able to develop a world-class manufacturing team. This team has successfully brought on line a production facility and scaled up and manufactured five molecules that are currently used in thousands of consumer goods products around the world. Our effort also expands into continued strain and process improvements to ensure our manufacturing is robust and the most cost advantaged.
 
Product Markets and Partnerships
 
There are three market areas that are our primary focus and key to our growth: Health & Wellness, Clean Skincare and Flavors & Fragrances. All of these markets embody our core competencies of sustainably providing clean ingredients in markets where we can be the most impactful, not only from a growth and revenue standpoint, but also for healthier living.
 
We believe that our leadership in biotechnology is demonstrated by collaboration partners, who come to us to access our platform and industrial fermentation expertise. Together we seek to reduce environmental impact, enhance performance, reduce supply and price volatility, and improve profit margins. Our partners include Flavors & Fragrances companies such as Firmenich S.A. (Firmenich) and Givaudan International, SA (Givaudan), and nutraceutical companies such as DSM. Our work has also been funded by the U.S. government, including the Department of Energy (DOE) and DARPA, to develop technologies and processes capable of improving the ability to utilize biotechnology for the production of a broader range of molecules.
 
Health & Wellness
 
Our Health & Wellness focus includes alternative sweeteners, nutraceuticals, such as vitamins, and food ingredients. As consumers continue to demand higher nutritional performance, cleaner labels and convenience from their food, the demand for specific ingredients that are often difficult and expensive to procure will continue to grow. Animal farming is also being impacted by the growing demand for protein and the need to change farming practices, such as reducing antibiotic use. Our technology can be employed to provide affordable access to these desired ingredients for both human and animal health. To date, product revenue in this area has been from a derivative made from our Biofene® product by our partner. In 2018, we plan to run at commercial scale our first developed molecule, a superior, alternative, non-nutritive sweetener.
 
During 2015, we announced the signings of our first ingredient supply agreement and collaboration agreement for the global nutraceuticals market. Under the supply agreement, we source Biofene to our partner, which is then further processed into a nutraceutical product. In 2016, we made the first large scale shipments of Biofene to our partner, who successfully produced and sold a nutraceutical product to its customers. In 2017, we expanded our collaborations in nutraceuticals to two vitamins and a human nutrition ingredient. We have also made significant progress in our alternative sweetener project and plan to initiate commercial scale runs in 2018.

Flavors & Fragrances
 
Our technology enables us to cost-effectively produce natural oils and aroma chemicals that are commonly used in the Flavors & Fragrances market. Many of the natural ingredients used in the Flavors & Fragrances market are expensive because there is limited supply and the synthetic alternatives require complex chemical conversions. We offer Flavors & Fragrances companies a natural route to procure these high-value ingredients without sacrificing cost or quality. To date, we have successfully brought three Flavors & Fragrances ingredients to market with our collaboration partners. We also have several other ingredients under development.
 
In late 2013, we commenced commercial production of our first Flavors & Fragrances ingredient for a range of applications, from perfumes to laundry detergent, which is marketed by a collaboration partner which is a global Flavors & Fragrances leader. In 2014, we completed our first production campaign of this ingredient and shipped it to this collaboration partner. In late 2015, we commenced production and initial sales of our second Flavors & Fragrances ingredient to the same collaboration partner. In 2017, we successfully completed our first commercial scale production and shipped our third Flavors & Fragrances ingredient to our partner.
 
We are currently working to develop and commercialize a variety of Flavors & Fragrances ingredients that are either direct fermentation products or derivatives of fermentation products.
 
Clean Skincare
 
Our Clean Skincare focus includes skincare and cosmetic ingredients we develop and commercialize with our partners and our branded BiossanceTM and Neossance product lines. In 2017, we successfully brought our first cosmetic ingredient to market with our collaboration partner and have several other ingredients currently under development. Our BiossanceTM and Neossance products are discussed further in the Amyris-branded Product Markets section.


In 2016, Amyris entered into a partnership in the field of cosmetic actives and completed the engineering of a yeast strain that can produce the first target in this space at significantly reduced cost. In 2017, we successfully launched the product with our partner. This will enable our partner to expand the market for this molecule into new applications and products. The speed to market for this ingredient reinforces the value proposition and strength of the Amyris technology platform and Amyris’s ability to scale up products for our partners.
 
Amyris-branded Product Markets
 
Through basic chemical finishing steps, we are able to convert our farnesene into squalane, which is used today as a premium emollient in Health & Wellness and Clean Skincare products. We believe that our squalane offers performance attributes equal or superior to those of squalane derived from conventional sources. The ingredient traditionally has been manufactured from olive oil or extracted from deep-sea shark liver oil, which requires that the shark be killed in order to harvest its liver oil. The relatively high price and unstable supply of squalane in the past meant that its use was generally limited to luxury products or small quantities in mass-market product formulations. With our ability to produce a reliable supply of low-cost squalane that eliminates the need to harvest shark liver oil, we offer this ingredient at a price that we believe will drive increasing adoption by formulators. In addition to squalane, we offer a second, lower-cost emollient, hemisqualane, for the cosmetics market. In December 2016, we formed a joint venture for our business-to-business sales of Neossance squalane and hemisqualane with Nikko Chemicals Co., Ltd. (Nikko), in which we hold a 50% interest. See below under “Joint Ventures” for more information regarding our Aprinnova joint venture. The joint venture currently has supply agreements with several regional distributors, including those with locations in Japan, South Korea, Europe, Brazil and North America, and, in some cases, directly with cosmetics formulators, which we transferred to the joint venture during the formation process.
 
In addition, in 2015 we launched our own consumer brand, BiossanceTM skincare products, featuring our Biofene-derived squalane. Under our BiossanceTM brand, we market and sell our products directly to retailers and consumers. BiossanceTM was initially sold solely through our ecommerce branded website and in 2016, we expanded the product line to include an expansive line of high-performance skincare products and opened up sales through Home Shopping Network (HSN). In October 2016, we announced our BiossanceTM product line would begin to be carried at Sephora in 2017. In February 2017, we launched a full squalane-based consumer cosmetic line at participating Sephora stores and Sephora online. All of the products are based on Amyris’s commitment to No CompromiseTM. Since the launch, sales have grown, and with Sephora’s partnership, we are looking to expand to more stores.

Manufacturing
 
Until December 2017, we owned and operated a large-scale production facility located in Brotas, Brazil. In December 2017, we sold the facility to a unit of DSM Nutritional Products Ltd (together with its affiliates, DSM) and entered into a supply agreement with DSM for us to purchase output from the facility. See Note 13, “Divestiture” in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our December 2017 transaction with DSM.
 
In February 2017, we broke ground on a second purpose-built, large-scale production facility that is adjacent to the first Brotas facility and which we will own and operate. We intend to complete construction of this facility in late 2019. In addition, in 2019, we plan to resume construction of a production facility in Pradópolis, Brazil that we partially built prior to 2013. This facility will support production of our alternative sweetener products.
 
For many of our products, we perform additional distillation or chemical finishing steps to convert initial target molecules into other finished products, such as renewable squalane. We have agreements with several facilities in the U.S. and Brazil to perform these downstream steps for such products. We may enter into additional agreements with other facilities for finishing services and to access flexible production capacity and an array of other services as we develop additional products. In December 2016, we purchased a manufacturing facility in Leland, North Carolina, which had been previously operated by Glycotech Inc. (Glycotech) to convert our Biofene into squalane and other final products. We subsequently contributed that facility to our Aprinnova joint venture. See below under “Joint Ventures” for more information regarding our Aprinnova joint venture.
 
Joint Ventures
 
Total Amyris BioSolutions B.V.
 
We have entered into a series of agreements since 2011 to establish a research and development program and form a joint venture with Total to produce and commercialize Biofene-based diesel and jet fuels. We formed such joint venture, Total Amyris BioSolutions B.V. (TAB), in November 2013. With an exception for our fuels business in Brazil, the collaboration and joint venture established the exclusive means for us to develop, produce and commercialize fuels from Biofene. We granted TAB exclusive licenses under certain of our intellectual property to make and sell joint venture products. We also granted TAB, in the event of a buy-out of our interest in the joint venture by Total (which Total is entitled to do under certain circumstances described below), a non-exclusive license to optimize or engineer yeast strains used by us to produce farnesene for the joint venture’s diesel and jet fuels. As a result of these licenses, Amyris generally no longer has an independent right to make or sell Biofene fuels outside of Brazil without the approval of TAB.
 
Our agreements with Total relating to our fuels collaboration created a convertible debt financing structure for funding the research and development program. The collaboration agreements contemplated $105.0 million in financing (R&D Notes) for the program, for which Total completed funding in January 2015.
 
In July 2015, we entered into a Letter Agreement with Total (as amended in February 2016, the TAB Letter Agreement) regarding the restructuring of the ownership and rights of TAB (the Restructuring), and on March 21, 2016, we, Total and TAB closed the Restructuring and entered into the Restructuring Agreements, including the Jet Fuel Agreement and the EU Diesel Fuel Agreement.
 
As a result of the Jet Fuel Agreement, we generally no longer have an independent right to make or sell, without the approval of TAB, farnesene- or farnesane-based jet fuels outside of Brazil. TAB elected not to exercise its option to purchase our Brazil jet fuel business, and such option is now expired.
 
As a result of the EU Diesel Fuel Agreement, we generally no longer have an independent right to make or sell, without the approval of Total, farnesene- or farnesane-based diesel fuels in the EU.
 
In addition, as part of the closing of the Restructuring and pursuant to the TAB Letter Agreement, on March 21, 2016, we sold to Total one half of our ownership stake in TAB (giving Total an aggregate ownership stake of 75% of TAB and giving us an aggregate ownership stake of 25% of TAB) in exchange for Total canceling (i) $1.3 million of R&D Notes, plus all paid-in-kind and accrued interest under all outstanding R&D Notes (including all such interest that was outstanding as of July 29, 2015) and (ii) a note in the principal amount of €50,000, plus accrued interest, issued to Total in connection with the original TAB capitalization. To satisfy its purchase obligation above, Total surrendered to us the remaining R&D Note of $5.0 million in principal amount, and we executed and delivered to Total a new R&D Note, containing substantially similar terms and conditions other than it is unsecured and its payment terms are severed from TAB’s business performance, in the principal amount of $3.7 million. See Note 4, “Debt” and Note 18, “Subsequent Events” in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding such R&D Note.

As a result of, and in order to reflect, the changes to the ownership structure of TAB described above, on March 21, 2016, (a) we, Total and TAB entered into an Amended and Restated Shareholders’ Agreement and filed a Deed of Amendment of Articles of Association of TAB and (b) we and Total terminated the Amended and Restated Master Framework Agreement, dated December 2, 2013 and amended on April 1, 2015, between us and Total.
 
Novvi LLC
 
In June 2011, we entered into joint venture agreements with Cosan US. Inc. (Cosan U.S. and, together with its affiliates, Cosan) related to the formation of a joint venture to focus on the worldwide development, production and commercialization of base oils made from Biofene for the automotive, commercial and industrial lubricants markets. In September 2011, we formed Novvi, an entity that was initially jointly owned by Cosan U.S. and us. In connection with the formation of Novvi, we entered into an IP License Agreement with Novvi (as amended, the Novvi IP License Agreement) and both the Company and Cosan U.S. granted Novvi certain rights of first refusal with respect to alternative base oil and additive technologies that may be acquired by the Company or Cosan U.S. during the term of the IP License Agreement, which was 20 years. In March 2013, we entered into additional agreements with Cosan U.S. to (i) expand our base oils joint venture with Cosan to also include additives and lubricants and (ii) operate the joint venture exclusively through Novvi, and amended the Novvi IP License Agreement to reflect such additional agreements. Under these agreements, Amyris and Cosan U.S. each owned 50% of Novvi, and each shared equally in any costs and any profits ultimately realized by the joint venture. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, we and Cosan U.S. purchased additional membership units in Novvi in exchange for cash and/or forgiveness of existing receivables, and made certain loans to Novvi in an aggregate amount of $8.3 million. Following such transactions, Amyris and Cosan U.S. continued to each own 50% of Novvi.
 
In July 2016, American Refining Group, Inc. (ARG) agreed to make a capital contribution of up to $10.0 million in cash to Novvi, subject to certain conditions, in exchange for a one third ownership stake in Novvi. In connection with such investment, we and Cosan U.S. also agreed to make certain contributions to Novvi (including the forgiveness of outstanding loans and existing receivables) in exchange for receiving additional membership units in Novvi. Following the ARG investment, which was fully funded as of March 31, 2017, and the contributions of us and Cosan U.S., each of Novvi’s three members (i.e., ARG, Amyris and Cosan U.S.) owned one third of Novvi. In July 2016, the Novvi joint venture documents and the Novvi IP License Agreement were amended in order to reflect the ARG investment in Novvi and related transactions, and Amyris and Novvi entered into a Renewable Farnesene Supply Agreement (the Novvi Supply Agreement) relating to the supply of farnesene by Amyris to Novvi in connection with the joint venture.
 
In November 2016, Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (Chevron) made a capital contribution of $1.0 million in cash to Novvi in exchange for a 3% ownership stake in Novvi, which reduced the ownership interests of Amyris, Cosan U.S. and ARG pro rata. In connection with its investment in Novvi, Chevron was granted certain rights to purchase additional units in Novvi as well as the right to purchase up to its pro rata share of additional membership units that Novvi may, from time to time, propose to sell or issue.
 
In October 2017, H&R Group US, Inc. (H&R) made a capital contribution of $10.0 million in cash to Novvi in exchange for a 24.4% ownership stake in Novvi, which reduced the ownership interests of Amyris, Cosan U.S., ARG and Chevron pro rata. As a result of such investment, each of Amyris, Cosan U.S., ARG and H&R owned 24.4% of Novvi, with Chevron owning the remaining 2.4%. In October 2017, the Novvi joint venture documents and the Novvi IP License Agreement were amended in order to reflect the H&R investment in Novvi and related transactions.
 
In December 2017, we assigned the Novvi Supply Agreement to DSM as part of the purchase and sale of our Brotas facility. See Note 13, “Divestiture” in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our December 2017 transaction with DSM.
 
Aprinnova, LLC
 
In December 2016, we entered into joint venture agreements with Nikko related to the formation of a joint venture to focus on the worldwide commercialization of our Neossance cosmetic ingredients business. In December 2016, we formed the joint venture under the name Neossance, LLC, and later changed the name to Aprinnova, LLC (the Aprinnova JV), which is jointly owned by us and Nikko. Pursuant to the joint venture agreements, we contributed certain assets to the Aprinnova JV, including certain intellectual property and other commercial assets relating to our Neossance cosmetic ingredients business, as well as the production facility in Leland, North Carolina and related assets purchased by us from Glycotech in December 2016. We also agreed to provide the Aprinnova JV with licenses to certain intellectual property necessary to make and sell products associated with the Neossance business (the Aprinnova JV Products). At the closing of the formation of the joint venture, Nikko purchased a 50% interest in the Aprinnova JV in exchange for an initial payment of $10.0 million and the profits, if any, distributed from the Aprinnova JV to Nikko as a member in cash during the three year period following December 12, 2016, up to a maximum of $10.0 million. In addition, as part of the formation of the Aprinnova JV, we and Nikko agreed to make certain working capital loans to Aprinnova JV and we further agreed to execute a supply agreement to supply farnesene to the Aprinnova JV, to purchase all of our requirements for the Aprinnova JV Products from the Aprinnova JV, to transfer all of our customers for the Aprinnova JV Products to the Aprinnova JV, to guarantee a maximum production cost for certain Aprinnova JV Products, and to bear any cost of production above such guaranteed costs.

Product Distribution and Sales
 
We distribute and sell our products directly to distributors or collaborators, or through joint ventures, depending on the market. For most of our products, we sell directly to our collaboration partners, except for our consumer care products, which we sell to distributors and formulators (other than our Biossance™ brand, which we sell directly to retailers and consumers). Generally, our collaboration agreements include commercial terms, and sales are contingent upon achievement of technical and commercial milestones.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenue from 10%-or-more customers and from all other customers was as follows:

Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in large part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and technologies, and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We seek to avoid the latter by monitoring patents and publications in our product areas and technologies to be aware of developments that may affect our business, and to the extent we identify such developments, evaluate and take appropriate courses of action. With respect to the former, our policy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing for patent applications on inventions that are important to the development and conduct of our business with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the USPTO), and its foreign counterparts.
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 474 issued U.S. and foreign patents and 315 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications that are owned or co-owned by or licensed to us. We also use other forms of protection (such as trademark, copyright, and trade secret) to protect our intellectual property, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. We aim to take advantage of all of the intellectual property rights that are available to us and believe that this comprehensive approach provides us with a strong proprietary position.
 
Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by patents, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Our proprietary rights may not adequately protect our technologies and product candidates.”
 
We also protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisers to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also prevent them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us. In addition, we also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.

Trademarks
 
Amyris, the Amyris logo, Biofene, BiossanceTM and No Compromise are trademarks or registered trademarks of Amyris, Inc. This report also contains trademarks and trade names of other businesses that are the property of their respective holders.
Competition
 
We expect that our renewable products will compete with products produced from traditional sources as well as from alternative production methods that established enterprises and new companies are seeking to develop and commercialize.
Health & Wellness
 
Many active ingredients in the nutraceutical market are made via chemical synthesis by suppliers that have a deep chemistry knowhow and production facilities, including ingredient suppliers. We may compete directly with these companies with respect to specific ingredients or attempt to provide customers with more cost effective or higher performing alternatives. For food ingredients, we compete with companies that produce products from plant and animal derived sources as well as with companies that are also developing biotechnology production solutions to produce specific molecules.
Flavors & Fragrances
 
The main competition for Flavors & Fragrances and cosmetic actives is from products derived from plant and animal sources as well as chemical synthesis. The products derived from plant and animal sources are typically produced at a higher cost, lower purity and create a greater impact on the environment compared to our products. Products derived from chemical synthesis are often produced at a low cost but have ramifications on sustainability as well as non-natural sourcing. There are also companies that are working to develop products using similar technology to us.
Clean Skincare
 
We develop and sell active e cosmetic ingredients and consumer products in the Clean Skincare market, creating a competitive landscape that includes ingredient suppliers as well as consumer goods companies, such as P&G and Estee Lauder. Most skincare ingredients are derived from plant and animal sources or created using chemical synthesis. Plant- and animal-sourced ingredients are typically higher in cost, lower in purity and have a greater impact on the environment versus our products. Products derived from chemical synthesis are often produced at a low cost but have ramifications on sustainability as well as non-natural sourcing. There are also companies that are working to develop products using similar technology to us.
Competitive Factors
 
We believe the primary competitive factors in our target markets are:
 

• | product price;
--+---------------


• | product performance and other measures of quality;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | infrastructure compatibility of products;
--+------------------------------------------


• | sustainability; and
--+--------------------


• | dependability of supply.
--+-------------------------

 
We believe that, for our products to succeed in the market, we must demonstrate that our products are comparable or better alternatives to existing products and to any alternative products that are being developed for the same markets based on some combination of product cost, availability, performance, and consumer preference characteristics.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
Environmental Regulations
 
Our development and production processes involve the use, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and permit requirements governing the use, generation, manufacture, transportation, storage, handling and disposal of these materials in the United States, Brazil and other countries where we operate or may operate or sell our products in the future. These laws, regulations and permits can require expensive fees, pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impact of our technology on the environment and violation of these laws could result in significant fines, civil sanctions, permit revocation or costs from environmental remediation. We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental regulations and permitting. However, future developments including the commencement of or changes in the processes relating to commercial manufacturing of one or more of our products, more stringent environmental regulation, policies and enforcement, the implementation of new laws and regulations or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. See “Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business - We may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities.”

GMM Regulations
 
The use of genetically-modified microorganisms (GMMs), such as our yeast strains, is subject to laws and regulations in many countries. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates the commercial use of GMMs as well as potential products produced from the GMMs. Various states within the United States could choose to regulate products made with GMMs as well. While the strain of genetically modified yeast that we use, S. cerevisiae, is eligible for exemption from EPA review because it is generally recognized as safe, we must satisfy certain criteria to achieve this exemption, including but not limited to, use of compliant containment structures and safety procedures. In Brazil, GMMs are regulated by the National Biosafety Technical Commission (CTNBio) under its Biosafety Law No. 11.105-2005. We have obtained commercial approvals from CTNBio to use our GMMs in a contained environment in our Brazil facilities for research and development purposes, in manufacturing and at contract manufacturing facilities in Brazil.
 
We expect to encounter GMM regulations in most if not all of the countries in which we may seek to make our products; however, the scope and nature of these regulations will likely vary from country to country. If we cannot meet the applicable requirements in countries in which we intend to produce our products using our yeast strains, then our business will be adversely affected. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Our use of genetically-modified feedstocks and yeast strains to produce our products subjects us to risks of regulatory limitations and rejection of our products.”
 
Chemical Regulations
 
Our renewable products may be subject to government regulations in our target markets. In the United States, the EPA administers the requirements of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which regulates the commercial registration, distribution and use of many chemicals. Before an entity can manufacture or distribute significant volumes of a chemical, it needs to determine whether that chemical is listed in the TSCA inventory. If the substance is listed, then manufacture or distribution can commence immediately. If not, then in most cases a “Chemical Abstracts Service” number registration and pre-manufacture notice must be filed with the EPA, which has 90 days to review the filing. A similar requirement exists in Europe under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances (REACH) regulation. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - We may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for the sale of our renewable products.” In 2013, the EPA registered farnesane as a new chemical substance under the TSCA, which enables us to manufacture and sell farnesane without restriction in the United States.
Other Regulations
 
Certain of our current or proposed products in the Health & Wellness, Clean Skincare, and Flavors & Fragrances markets, including alternative sweeteners, nutraceuticals, Flavors & Fragrances ingredients, skincare ingredients and cosmetic actives, may be subject to regulation by the United State Food and Drug Administration (the FDA), as well as similar agencies of states and foreign jurisdictions where these products are sold or proposed to be sold. Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA), the FDA regulates the processing, formulation, safety, manufacture, packaging, labeling and distribution of food ingredients, vitamins, and cosmetics. Generally, in order to be marketed and sold in the United States, a relevant product must be generally recognized as safe and not adulterated or misbranded under the FDCA and relevant regulations issued thereunder. The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of the FDCA applicable to food ingredients, vitamins and cosmetics, including powers to issue a public warning letter to a company, to publicize information about illegal products, to request a recall of illegal products from the market, and to request the United States Department of Justice to initiate a seizure action, an injunction action, or a criminal prosecution in the U. S. courts. Failure to obtain requisite approval from, or comply with the laws and regulations of, the FDA or similar agencies of states and applicable foreign jurisdictions could prevent us from fully commercializing certain of our products. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - We may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for the sale of our renewable products.”

In addition, our end-user products such as our BiossanceTM brand skincare products are subject to the regulations of the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and similar agencies of states and foreign jurisdictions where these products are sold or proposed to be sold regarding the advertising of such products. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. The FTC has broad authority to enforce its laws and regulations applicable to cosmetics, including the ability to institute enforcement actions which often result in consent decrees, injunctions, and the payment of civil penalties by the companies involved. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations of the FTC or similar agencies of states and applicable foreign jurisdictions could impair our ability to market our end-user products.
