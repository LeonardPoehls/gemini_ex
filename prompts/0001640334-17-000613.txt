ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act. We will continue to be an emerging growth company until: (i) the last day of our fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, as defined in Section 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.
 
As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from:
 
Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Exchange Act, which requires companies to hold stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation;
 
The requirement to provide in any registration statement periodic report or other report to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, certain modified executive compensation disclosure under Item 402 of Regulation S-K or selected financial data under Item 301 of Regulation S-K for any period before the earliest audited period presented in our initial registration statement;
 
Compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies;
 
The requirement under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to provide auditor attestation of our internal controls and procedures; and
 
Any Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") rules regarding mandatory audit firm rotation, or an expanded auditor report and any other PCAOB rules subsequently adopted, unless the Securities and Exchange Commission determines the new rules are necessary for protecting the public.
 
We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.
 
Our company was incorporated in Nevada on April 11, 2014. Most of the activity through December 31, 2016 involved incorporation efforts and preparation for an Offering.
 
Prior to take over by new management in December 30, 2016, we are a development stage company and have limited financial resources. We have not established a source of equity or debt financing. Our financial statements include a note emphasizing the uncertainty of our ability to remain a going concern.
 
We initially planned to become an online platform for investments in Israeli start-up companies through equity-based crowd funding. This online platform would present start up companies in various fields. Potential investors will be able to click on any start up company they would like to know more about and get access to its marketing information and legal and financial disclosures.
 
We previously planned to match up Israeli start-ups looking to raise funds with potential investors from all over the world seeking to make investments in such start-ups. The goal is to help many start-up companies that could not or would not raise funds from Angels or Venture Capital funds get access to a large pool of retail investors looking for such investment opportunities. Such match up would open another important fundraising channel for start-up companies and allow retail investors to diversify their investment portfolio. We will not allow U.S. persons access to the materials presented by the start-ups offering their securities on our website, unless we first register as a broker-dealer with the SEC under Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Anyone trying to gain access to the offering materials posted on our website will first need to fill out a short questionnaire which will include a question about the country of residence. Anyone answering U.S.A or any of its states will be prohibited from gaining access to the page showing the offering materials of the presenting companies.

Business Model
 
On December 30, 2016, new management took over the Company majority shares and plans to operate the Company under the new name of "Sheng Ying Entertainment Corp.". The Company’s new business plan is to engage in the service of sub-junkets for a junket in Cambodia. For sub-junkets introduction service performed, we will charge 0.05% of total bets played by players introduced by us to a junket in casino located in Cambodia.
 
On January 9, 2017, the Company filed a certificate of amendment (the "Amendment") to its Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in order to change its name to "Sheng Ying Entertainment Corp." in order to better reflect the direction and business of the Company. As of the filing date, the name change is still subject to the approval of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The Company has adopted a fiscal year end of December 31.
 
We have plans to establish a website which set forth general information for junket business of the Company in future.
 
Based on our current operating plan, we expect that we will be able to generate revenue that is sufficient to cover our expenses for the next twelve months. Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital. 
 
Marketing & Growth Strategy
 
We have hire a Chief Operation Officer who has over 10 years of junket business in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. We believe with her experience in this area will direct the company to acquire a lot of VIP players to achieve company’s financial prospects in this burgeoning niche. With the existence of our Chief Operation Officer based in Cambodia, she is able to provide all kinds of support and services immediately in the casino where our VIP players play. 
 
Player retention is one of the strategies to grow our future sub-junket business. The key elements of player retention are the creation of exciting opportunities to maintain player interest and increase play frequency. Similar to land-based casino's compensation programs, the tools used for this purpose include prizes, "free money," opportunities to play against famous (or infamous) players, and tournament qualifications.

Market Overview
 
Junket business in Southeast Asia estimated will continue growth especially Macau government banned phone betting, as tightened regulations called for stricter accounting transparency. Macau’s gaming industry has seen revenue declines for nearly two years amid China’s slowing economy and anti-corruption campaign. 
Competition
 
We believe emerging casino hubs in Southeast Asia have lower overheads than other region such as Macao and can promise higher incentives to wealthy gamblers. They also offer greater privacy, a key advantage for wealthy players. 
Regulatory Environment
 
Regulations relating to casino gaming vary significantly in different jurisdictions. Although the Company can set pre-emptive measures, it is still currently unable to ensure that sub-junkets only receive deposits from gamers in jurisdictions in which we are legally entitled to provide services.
Intellectual Property
 
We have no patents or trademarks.
