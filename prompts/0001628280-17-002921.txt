Item 1. | BUSINESS

General
CNL Lifestyle Properties, Inc. is a Maryland corporation incorporated on August 11, 2003. The terms “we,” “our,” or “us,” “the Company” and “CNL Lifestyle Properties” include CNL Lifestyle Properties, Inc. and each of its subsidiaries. We operate as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”). Two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, CLP GP Corp. and CLP LP Partners Corp., are the general and limited partners, respectively, of CLP Partners, LP, which is our operating partnership and which conducts substantially all of our operations and owns substantially all of our assets. We have retained CNL Lifestyle Advisor Corporation (the “Advisor”), as our Advisor to provide management, acquisition, disposition, advisory and administrative services. Our offices are located at 450 South Orange Avenue within the CNL Center at City Commons in Orlando, Florida 32801, and our telephone number is (407)650-1000.
As part of Our Exit Strategy described below, in November 2016, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of our remaining 36 properties (the "Sale Agreement") for approximately $830.0 million, as previously disclosed on Form 8-K filed on November 2, 2016. In connection with the transaction contemplated by the Sale Agreement, in November 2016, our board of directors approved a plan of liquidation and dissolution (the "Plan of Dissolution") and also approved the suspension of our quarterly cash distribution on our common stock effective as of the fourth quarter distribution. 
1

At a special meeting of the stockholders held on March 24, 2017, our stockholders approved:

▪ | the sale of all of our remaining properties (the “Sale”) to EPR Properties, a Maryland real estate investment trust (“EPR”), and Ski Resort Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company affiliated with Och-Ziff Real Estate(“SRH”), pursuant to the Sale Agreement and


▪ | the Plan of Dissolution, including our complete liquidation and dissolution contemplated thereby, subject to the approval of the Sale and following the closing of the Sale.

We expect to close the Sale in the second quarter of 2017, at which time we will receive approximately $830 million, which is estimated to be paid (i) approximately $183 million in cash, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Sale Agreement and (ii) approximately $647 million of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of beneficial interest of EPR (“EPR common shares”). The number of EPR common shares to be received by us will be determined by dividing approximately $647 million by the volume weighted average price per EPR common share on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) for the ten business days ending on the second business day before the closing of the Sale (the “Closing VWAP”), provided that (i) if the Closing VWAP is less than $68.25, then the calculation will be made as if the Closing VWAP were $68.25 and (ii) if the Closing VWAP is greater than $82.63, then the calculation will be made as if the Closing VWAP were $82.63. We anticipate distributing to stockholders the EPR common shares (and a portion of the cash consideration after repayment of associated liabilities) within two weeks after the closing. 
Upon consummation of the Sale, we will transfer all of our remaining properties to EPR and SRH, as applicable, and we will continue to exist as a separate legal entity until our subsequent liquidation and dissolution pursuant to the Plan of Dissolution. 
Our Exit Strategy
We began a process of evaluating strategic alternatives in an effort to provide stockholders with liquidity of their investment. In connection with these objectives, in March 2014, we engaged Jefferies LLC ("Jefferies") and formed a special committee comprised solely of our independent directors to assist management and the board of directors in actively evaluating various strategic opportunities. In connection with this process, between 2014 and 2015, we sold 104 properties and also sold our 81.98% interest in the DMC Partnership, an unconsolidated joint venture that owned and operated the Dallas Market Center (the “DMC Partnership”), for aggregate net sales proceeds of approximately $1.516 billion. We used the net sales proceeds from the sale of these properties to repay indebtedness during 2014 and 2015. In accordance with our undertaking to provide stockholders with partial liquidity, we also used a portion of net sales proceeds received from the sale of properties during the year ended December 31, 2015 to make a special distribution to stockholders of approximately $422.7 million during December 2015.
During 2016, we completed the sale of our remaining five marina properties and our unimproved land for more than their carrying value. Additionally, in April 2016 we acquired our co-venture partner’s 20% interest in the Intrawest Venture and subsequently in October 2016, we sold the seven ski and mountain lifestyle properties, which were owned through the Intrawest Venture, for approximately their net carrying value. As of December 31, 2016, we held ownership interests in 36 properties.
As described above, in November 2016, we entered into the Sale Agreement for the Sale of our remaining 36 properties for approximately $830.0 million. In connection with the transaction contemplated by the Sale Agreement, in November 2016, our board of directors approved the Plan of Dissolution. The board of directors also declared and paid a special cash distribution of approximately $162.6 million, or $0.50 per share, during November 2016. In addition, in light of the Plan of Dissolution, our board of directors also approved the suspension of our quarterly cash distribution on our common stock effective as of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution. 
As of March 16, 2017, when aggregated by initial purchase price, the portfolio of 36 properties is diversified as follows: approximately 58% in ski and mountain lifestyle and 42% in attractions. These assets consist of 16 ski and mountain lifestyle properties and 20 attractions properties with the following investment structure:

Wholly-owned: (1) | 
Leased properties | 24
Managed properties | 12
 | 36

FOOTNOTE:

(1) | Our real estate investment portfolio is geographically diversified with properties in 18 states and one Canadian province.

Our tenants and operators. We generally attempt to lease our properties to tenants and operators that we consider to be industry leading. However, we do not believe the success of our properties is based solely on the performance or abilities of our tenants and operators. In some cases, we consider the assets we have acquired to be unique, iconic or nonreplicable which by their nature have an intrinsic value. In addition, in the event a tenant is in default and vacates a property, under special provisions in the tax 
2

laws, we are able to engage a third-party manager to operate the property on our behalf for a period of time until we re-lease it to a new tenant. During this period, the property remains open and we receive any net earnings from the property’s operations. These amounts may be more or less than the rents that were contractually due under the prior leases. Any taxable income from these properties will be subject to income tax until we re-lease these properties to new tenants.
Financial information about geographic areas. We have one consolidated property, Cypress Mountain, located in British Columbia, Canada, which generated total rental income of approximately $5.9 million, $5.1 million and $6.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
As of December 31, 2015 and through March 31, 2016, we also owned interests in two other properties located in Canada through the Intrawest joint venture that generated a combined equity in earnings (loss) of approximately $0.3 million, $0.9 million and ($0.1) million during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. On April 1, 2016, we acquired the remaining 20% interest in the Intrawest joint venture and upon acquisition we began consolidating the results of operations of the two properties located in Canada in our consolidated financial statements. These two properties located in Canada were subsequently sold in October 2016. During the period April 2016 through October 2016, these two properties generated total rental income of approximately $2.7 million.
The remainder of our net income was generated from properties or investments located in the United States.
Our leases and ventures. Our leases are usually structured as triple-net leases which means our tenants are generally responsible for repairs, maintenance, property taxes, ground lease or permit expenses (where applicable), utilities and insurance for the properties that they lease.
The weighted-average lease rate of our consolidated properties subject to long-term triple-net leases as of December 31, 2016 was approximately 10%. This rate was based on the weighted-average annualized straight-lined base rent due under our leases. We typically structure our leases to provide for the payment of a minimum annual base rent with periodic increases in base rent over the lease term. In addition, our leases typically provide for the payment of percentage rent based on a percentage of gross revenues generated at the property over certain thresholds. Within the provisions of our leases, we also generally require the payment of capital improvement reserve rent. Capital improvement reserve rents are paid by the tenant, are generally based on a percentage of gross revenue of the property and are set aside by us for capital improvements, replacements and other capital expenditures at the property. These amounts are and will remain our property during and after the term of the lease and help maintain the integrity of our assets.
Our leases are generally long-term in nature (generally five to 20 years with multiple renewal options). Some of our tenants operate more than one of our properties with the leases being cross-defaulted. As of December 31, 2016, we have 24 consolidated properties structured as triple-net leases with the average lease expiration of approximately 13 years. We have eight leases scheduled to expire in 2026. None of our other leases are scheduled to expire within the next 10 years.
Our managed properties. When beneficial to our investment structure and subject to applicable tax regulations, certain properties may be leased to wholly-owned tenants that are taxable REIT subsidiaries or that are owned through taxable REIT subsidiaries (referred to as “TRS” entities). Under this structure, we engage a third-party manager to conduct day-to-day operations and our results of operations will include the operating results of the underlying properties as opposed to rental income from operating leases that is recorded for properties leased to third-party tenants. In addition, in the case of a tenant default and lease termination, we may engage a third-party manager to operate the property on our behalf for a period of time until we can re-lease the property. This allows us time to stabilize the property, if necessary, and enter into a new lease when market conditions are potentially more favorable. During this managed period, we recognize all the underlying property operating revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and may be subject to more direct operating risk including risks associated with seasonality and are subject to federal income tax on taxable income from the operations. See “Seasonality” below for additional information.
Our joint ventures. We entered into joint ventures in which our partners subordinate their returns to our minimum return. As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of seven properties, under leased structure, owned through our 80% interest in an unconsolidated joint venture. In April 2016, the Company satisfied the terms and conditions under the buy-sell provisions of the partnership agreement and acquired its co-venture partner's 20% interest in the Intrawest Venture for a nominal amount, agreed to sell the seven leased properties and sold the seven properties in October 2016.
Seasonality. Many of the asset classes in which we have invested experience seasonal fluctuations due to the nature of their business, geographic location, climate and weather patterns. As a result, these businesses experience seasonal variations in revenues that may require our operators to supplement operating cash from their properties in order to be able to make scheduled rent payments to us. We have structured the leases for certain tenants such that rents are paid on a seasonal schedule with most, if not all, of the rent being paid during the tenant’s seasonally busy operating period.
As part of our portfolio diversification strategy, we specifically considered the varying and complimentary seasonality of our asset classes and portfolio mix. For example, the peak operating season for our ski and mountain lifestyle assets is highly complementary to the peak seasons for our attractions to balance and mitigate the risks associated with seasonality. Generally, seasonality does 
3

not significantly affect our recognition of rental income from operating leases due to straight-line revenue recognition in accordance with GAAP. However, seasonality may impact the timing of when base rent payments are made by our tenants, which impacts our operating cash flows. Additionally, seasonality affects the amount of rental revenue we recognize in connection with capital improvement reserve revenue and percentage rents paid by our tenants, which is recognized in the period in which it is earned and is generally based on a percentage of tenant revenues.
Seasonality also directly impacts certain of our properties where we engage independent third-party operators to manage on our behalf and where we record property operating revenues and expenses rather than straight-line rents from operating leases. These properties will likely generate net operating losses during their non-peak months while generating most, if not all, of their operating income during their peak operating months. Our consolidated operating results and cash flows during the first, second and fourth quarters will be lower than the third quarter primarily due to the non-peak operating months of our larger attractions properties. As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 12 wholly-owned managed attractions properties. 
Significant tenants. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we had one tenant who generated more than 10% of total revenues from continuing operations. This tenant operates seven of our ski and mountain lifestyle properties and represented approximately $43.1 million of our consolidated revenues from continuing operations. 
Termination and REIT Status
Our articles of incorporation provide that the board of directors shall use its best efforts to take such actions as are necessary, and may take such actions as it deems desirable, to preserve the status of the Company as a REIT. However, in the event that the board of directors determines, by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Directors, that it is no longer in the best interests of the Company to remain qualified as a REIT, the board of directors shall cause the termination of the Company’s qualification as a REIT to be submitted to a vote of the Company’s stockholders. The stockholders may terminate the Company’s status as a REIT by a vote of holders of majority of our shares of stock outstanding and entitled to vote.
Our articles of incorporation also provide for the Company’s voluntary termination and dissolution by the affirmative vote of a majority of our shares of stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Under Maryland law, the Company’s voluntary termination and dissolution must also be declared advisable by a majority of the entire board of directors. As described above, in November 2016, our board of directors approved our Plan of Dissolution and on March 24, 2017, our stockholders approved our Plan of Dissolution.
Financial Information About Industry Segments
We have determined that we operate in one business segment, real estate ownership, which consists of investing in and owning a diversified portfolio of real estate primarily within the United States. We view, manage and evaluate all of our lifestyle properties homogeneously as one collection of assets with a common goal to maximize revenues and property income regardless of the type (ski and attractions) or ownership structure (leased or managed). Our chief operating decision maker reviews all of our properties as one consolidated portfolio and does not drive resource allocation decisions based on individual property or groups of properties. Accordingly, we do not report segment information.
Advisory Services
Under the terms of the advisory agreement, our Advisor is responsible for our day-to-day operations, administers our bookkeeping and accounting functions, serves as our consultant in connection with policy decisions to be made by our board of directors, manages our properties and renders other services as the board of directors deems appropriate. In addition, the Advisor engages and contracts with certain of its affiliates to provide services and personnel to the Company. In exchange for these services, our Advisor is entitled to receive certain fees from us. For supervision and day-to-day management of our properties, our Advisor receives an asset management fee, which is payable monthly, based on the total real estate asset value of our properties as defined in the advisory agreement (exclusive of acquisition fees and acquisition expenses), and the amount invested in any other permitted investments as of the end of the preceding month. 
In addition, we reimburse our Advisor for all of the costs it incurs in connection with the administrative services it provides to us. However, in accordance with the advisory agreement, our Advisor is required to reimburse us for the amount by which the total operating expenses (as described in the advisory agreement) incurred by us in any four consecutive fiscal quarters (the “Expense Year”) exceed the greater of 2% of average invested assets or 25% of net income (the “Expense Cap”). For the Expense year ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, operating expenses did not exceed the Expense Cap.
Legal and Regulatory Considerations
General. Our properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas. We believe that each of our properties as of December 31, 2016 had the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business.
Americans with Disabilities Act. Our U.S. properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA, to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal 
4

of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We are not aware of any material noncompliance with the ADA at our properties. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors – Real Estate and Other Investment Risks – Certain of our properties are subject to environmental liabilities that could significantly impact our return from the properties and the success of our ventures.”
Environmental, Health, and Safety Matters. We are subject to many federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety laws. The applicability of specific environmental, health, and, safety laws to each of our individual properties is dependent upon a number of property-specific factors, including: the current and former uses of the property; any impacts to the property from other properties; the type and amount of any emissions or discharges from or releases at the property; the building materials used at the property, including any asbestos-containing materials; and the type and amount of any hazardous substances or wastes used, stored, or generated at the property.
Under various laws relating to protection of the environment, current and former owners and operators of real property may be liable for any contamination resulting from the presence or release of hazardous or toxic substances at the property. Current and former owners and operators may also be held liable to the government or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and remediation costs related to contamination, regardless of whether the owners and operators were responsible for or even knew of the contamination, and the liability may be joint and several. The government may be entitled to a lien on a contaminated property. Certain environmental laws, as well as the common law, may subject us to liability for damages or injuries suffered by third parties as a result of environmental contamination or releases originating at our properties, including releases of asbestos, and the liabilities associated with our properties could exceed the values of the respective properties. Some of our properties were previously used for industrial purposes, and those properties may contain some degree of contamination. Environmental impacts or contamination at our properties may prevent us from selling or leasing the properties or using them as collateral. Environmental laws may regulate the use of our properties or the types of operations which can be conducted at our properties, and these regulations may necessitate corrective or other expenditures.
Some of our properties may contain asbestos-containing building materials. Asbestos-containing building materials are subject to management and maintenance requirements under environmental laws, and owners and operators may be subject to penalty for noncompliance. Environmental laws may allow suits by third parties for recovery from owners and operators for personal injury related to exposure to asbestos-containing building materials.
Prior to the purchase of our properties, we generally engage independent environmental consultants to perform Phase I environmental assessments, which normally do not involve soil, groundwater or other invasive sampling. When Phase I environmental assessment results indicated the need to do so, we conducted Phase II assessments, which do involve invasive sampling. These assessments have not revealed any materially adverse environmental conditions which impact or have impacted our properties other than conditions which have been remediated or are currently undergoing remediation. There can be no assurance, however, that new environmental liabilities have not developed since the assessments were performed, that the assessment failed to reveal material adverse environmental conditions, liabilities, or compliance concerns, or that future developments, including changes in laws or regulations, will not impose environmental costs or liabilities upon us. If we become subject to material environmental liabilities, these liabilities could adversely affect us, our business and assets, the results of our operations, and our ability to meet our obligations. See, “Risk Factors – Real Estate and Other Investment Risks – Our properties may be subject to environmental liabilities that could significantly impact or return from the properties and the success of our ventures.”
Insurance. We maintain, or cause operators to maintain, insurance including, but not limited to, liability, fire, wind, earthquake, and business income coverage on all of our properties that are not being leased on a triple-net basis under various policies. We select policy specifications, insured limits and self-insured retention limits which we believe to be appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice and, in the opinion of our company’s management, our properties that are not being leased on a triple-net basis are currently adequately insured. We do not carry insurance for generally uninsured losses such as loss from war or nuclear reaction. Certain of our properties are located in areas known to be seismically active. See “Risk Factors—Real Estate and Other Investment Risks—Potential losses may not be covered by insurance.”
Employees
We are externally managed and as such we do not have any employees.
