Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “SWEE”, “Registrant,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and “the Company” refer to SweeGen, Inc., a Nevada corporation that was formerly known as Aceway Corp. prior to its name change in December 2014. The term “Business Commencement” refers to the date the company commenced business operations (December 5, 2014).
 
Introduction
 
SweeGen, Inc., formerly Aceway Corp. (the “Company”), is a Nevada corporation incorporated on April 1, 2013. The Company is a development stage business-to-business company that intends to leverage its management team’s extensive experience and resources in managing and developing large and small private and public companies; pathway engineering; microbial platform development; and developing and supplying ingredients and biological products in the field of sweeteners to be used in its customers’ finished products. The Company intends to seek, develop and acquire, completely or a substantial interest in, companies or assets that would benefit from or that can be developed using the knowledge and expertise of the Company’s management resources. 
 
On December 23, 2014, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Phytosub, Inc. (“Phytosub”) and the shareholder of Phytosub (the “Phytosub Shareholder”), pursuant to which the Phytosub Shareholder transferred all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Phytosub to the Company in exchange for 25,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company (the “Share Exchange”). The transaction closed on December 23, 2014. As a result, Phytosub, a Nevada corporation formed on December 5, 2014, became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and the Phytosub Shareholder acquired a controlling interest in the Company. For accounting purposes, the Share Exchange was treated as an acquisition of Aceway Corp. and a recapitalization of PhytoSub. PhytoSub is the accounting acquirer, and the results of its operations carryover. Accordingly, the operations of Aceway Corp. are not carried over and have been adjusted to $0.
 
On December 23, 2014, the Company entered into a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Armando Espinoza, a former officer and director of the Company, pursuant to which the Company sold and transferred all assets of the Company existing prior to the consummation of the Share Exchange to Mr. Espinoza. The transaction closed on December 23, 2014. In consideration for the transfer of such assets, Mr. Espinoza (i) surrendered for cancellation 25,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock owned by him; and (ii) assumed any and all liabilities of the Company existing prior to the consummation of the Share Exchange and agreed to assume any and all liabilities of the Company later asserted against the Company that related to the Company’s operations prior to the consummation of the Share Exchange. Due to the cancellation of Mr. Espinoza’s 25,000,000 shares and the issuance of 25,000,000 shares to Phytosub pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Company had 35,000,020 shares of common stock par value $0.001 per share, immediately following the closing of issued and outstanding the transactions described above.
