ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview 
Aerohive Networks, Inc. and together with its subsidiaries (“Aerohive Networks,” “Aerohive,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) has designed and developed a leading cloud networking and enterprise Wi-Fi solution that enables our customers to use the power of Wi-Fi, cloud, analytics and applications to transform how they serve their customers. Our products include Wi-Fi access points, routers and switches required to build an edge-access network; a cloud services platform for centralized management in a wide range of customer environments; and data collection, analytics and applications that leverage the network to provide additional capabilities to the business and IT organization. Together, these products, service platform, data and applications create a simple, scalable, and secure solution to deliver a better-connected experience. Customers around the world, from Fortune 500 businesses to small schools, have chosen our products.
Technologies and Solutions
We have built our portfolio of products and solutions around three primary sets of technologies and capabilities:

• | Enterprise Cloud Networking. Using cloud-based technologies, whether as a public or private cloud, to manage the network and reduce the complexity of supporting large numbers of devices. 


• | Wi-Fi Connectivity. Wi-Fi access points and supporting wired devices built around a unique distributed control architecture that delivers simplicity, speed, security, and scale. 


• | Application and Insights. Collected data sets and analytics accessed through APIs that enable customized business & IT applications to unlock new information, insights, and engagement. 

We believe that each of these areas adds valuable customer capabilities, differentiates our offering, and showcases our continuing innovation.
Enterprise Cloud Networking. Our customers today are increasingly demanding simplicity in how they manage and operate their Wi-Fi network. Cloud networking enables us to deliver this. Our cloud networking capabilities, including our HiveManager network management applications, combine the benefits of the cloud with the feature depth required for managing enterprise-class networks. We believe we are the only major vendor who can provide these enterprise-class capabilities in both a public cloud and a private cloud deployment.
We have chosen to focus on enterprise cloud networking based on the compelling benefits we believe we can offer our customers. Legacy approaches to network management have relied on complex enterprise applications that customers must install, integrate, maintain, and administer themselves. New releases were infrequent and updates installed by customers even less frequent. In contrast, our cloud-based network management provides a single, integrated management view across the entire network that a user can access from virtually anywhere. We maintain and administer the network management application in the cloud, which users then access as a subscription service that can be regularly updated in response to new features or urgent changes. 
With our cloud networking and our HiveManager application, we deliver a number of important capabilities to our customers. While enterprise customers want simplified network management they still need a full set of features and capabilities. Our “progressive disclosure” user interface means that advanced features are available but are hidden from view when then are not being used. Similarly, organizations that need to deploy the network often do not have technical staff at every location. Our cloud networking supports automated provisioning, where a device that is connected to the network for the first time can automatically find and download its proper configuration. Our cloud network solution also includes troubleshooting capabilities, such as dashboards to quickly identify potential issues and monitoring to easily research and resolve issues. Finally, cloud networking makes it possible for a customer to very quickly evaluate the capabilities of our solution. A single wireless access point with a corresponding license for HiveManager gives customers complete access to our capabilities. In addition, those customers who want the capabilities of cloud networking but also need to manage their network in their own datacenter, behind their own firewall, can install and run HiveManager "on premises" at a customer location with similar functionality and same software as we offer in the public cloud. Overall, by taking advantage of our cloud network capabilities, our customers are able to manage even large networks with a small staff and limited resources.
While we were an early leader in cloud networking we continue to innovate and to invest in HiveManager as our strategic cloud networking application. We are focusing our current efforts on HiveManager NG, an updated version of our legacy HiveManager application, we now call HiveManager Classic, which features an updated user interface, improved troubleshooting, expanded access to data and analytics, and an upgraded cloud deployment platform. While HiveManager NG offers a more compelling customer solution, it also offers a more dynamic platform for innovation. In April 2016, we announced with our partner Dell, a Dell-branded version of HiveManager NG capable of managing Dell N-series switches in the same network as Aerohive Wi-Fi access points, delivering multi-vendor integrated wired and wireless network management. Throughout 2016, we delivered new releases of HiveManager NG that continued to expand our enterprise feature set and improve the user experience. In January 2017, we announced HiveManager Connect, a simplified version of HiveManager NG included as a part of our new Aerohive Connect product line designed for customers with less complex, connectivity oriented requirements. Aerohive's Connect customers can purchase a subscription to upgrade to our current full-featured offering, we refer to as Aerohive Select. Aerohive Select includes additional capabilities, such as advanced security and troubleshooting tools, support for Bring-Your-Own-Device programs, increased network visibility, enterprise support options, and the ability to deploy HiveManager on-premises or in a private cloud environment. The capabilities of our scalable cloud platform enabled all of these innovations.
During the second half of 2016, we saw significant increases in the rate of adoption HiveManager NG by new customers. We expect that HiveManager NG will over time replace the HiveManager Classic solution currently used by the majority of our customers. During this transition, we will continue to offer and support both versions of the application, working with current customers as appropriate to migrate to HiveManager NG. 
Scalable Wi-Fi. Our scalable Wi-Fi provides the network connectivity for the overall Aerohive solution. We have built our Wi-Fi around a distributed control architecture that simplifies operations and improves resilience. Integral to our Wi-Fi is the ability to securely control access to the wireless network. We also offer the access switches and branch routers needed for a complete access network infrastructure.
We believe our distributed control technology remains one of our key innovations and differentiators. Over the last decade, Wi-Fi architectures have gone through a series of evolutions in response to changing technologies and user requirements. When the original autonomous Wi-Fi access points proved difficult to manage vendors introduced wireless LAN controllers to the network. Wireless LAN controllers brought management and control, but they also brought the cost and complexity of dedicated hardware, a new single point of failure, and rigid deployments too inflexible to meet dynamic requirements of wireless networks. To overcome these limitations other vendors have integrated their controller with switches or Wi-Fi access points, or moved their controllers into the cloud, with greater cost and limited capabilities. In contrast, our architecture fully distributes the control plane across the Wi-Fi access points, eliminating the need for any wireless LAN controller and reducing cost of operations. We deliver the algorithms for distributed control through HiveOS, our device operating system that runs on every Aerohive Wi-Fi access point. HiveOS delivers radio management, client roaming, load balancing, policy enforcement, packet inspection and other functions locally on the Wi-Fi access point. 
Our distributed control architecture provides key benefits to our customers. Most important is the scalability of a single architecture effective for deployments from one to thousands of Wi-Fi access points. Most of our competitors have different technologies and products for different sizes of deployments. Instead, our customers can start small and grow as they need to without any change in architecture or Wi-Fi technology. Our customers can also mix different generations of Wi-Fi access points in the same network, providing investment protection. Overall, by intelligently distributing control over the Wi-Fi access points our architecture can support faster deployments and greater resiliency.
Integral to our scalable Wi-Fi is the ability to enforce security at the Wi-Fi access point based on the end user’s access policies, which can be based on the application being used, user identity and role, device type and ownership, location and time of day. Our Private Pre-Shared Key, or PPSK, technology extends these capabilities to assign each device a unique key for accessing the network that can be authorized or revoked without impacting any other network device. PPSK can also be used in Internet of Things deployments to authorize devices that do not have a keyboard or some other mechanism for providing credentials.
During 2016, we continued to expand our family of Wi-Fi access points in response to technology and market trends. We introduced two 802.11ac Wave 2 access points, the AP250 and AP550, both built on new high performance standards and components, and as a result, we saw strong growth in Wave 2 as a proportion of our business. The AP 250 and AP 550 offer the important innovation of dual 5 GHz radios that are software configurable radios which enable customers to effectively double the capacity of their networks. In January 2017, we announced the AP122 as our new entry-level 802.11ac access point. We remain active in the Wi-Fi Alliance and monitor emerging Wi-Fi technologies as input to our future product roadmap.
While we emphasize our Wi-Fi capabilities our portfolio also includes wired access switches and branch routers. Wireless access points generally connect to an access switch for connectivity and power. In the second half of 2016, we released a new family of cloud-managed access switches based on Broadcom's FastPath operating system. We believe that 
adopting an industry-standard platform will enable us to more quickly innovate and grow our switch business. We also continue to offer our previously available HiveOS-based switches and branch routers. Our Wi-Fi access points do not require either our switches or branch routers - they can be used with products from other major network hardware manufacturers. However, customers who purchase our access switches or branch routers gain the ability to manage them with their wireless access points through a single HiveManager interface. 
Applications and Insights. Increasingly, our customers are looking for value from their network beyond just connectivity. Wireless networks collect enormous amounts of data about users and devices - where they are, how they are being used, how often they are on the network, etc. Our emerging capabilities provide access to this data to enable new business and IT applications. While in some cases we may develop and sell applications, such as HiveManager NG, our primary role is to enable third party software developers to create applications using our data. Such application may address a variety of use cases including:    

• | Network Management. Tracking the behavior of the network to identify opportunities to improve performance. For example, our HiveManager NG application provides a simpler, more efficient way to manage a wireless and wired network. 


• | Network Access. Streamlining how access to the network is granted. For example, our personal device access capabilities can be integrated with an application to allow guests to register their devices on the network, then have their registration approved by an employee from his or her mobile phone. 


• | Business Insight. Tracking the presence and location of users and devices. For example, our presence data can be used to understand the behavior of consumers in a retail environment or when employees come to work in the office, or track student attendance. 

Application developers can take advantage of the Aerohive Cloud Services (ACS) platform. The ACS platform collects data from Aerohive network devices and, we expect in the future, from other vendor devices or other third-party sources. Collected data can be aggregated into a secure and scalable cloud-based store of big data, which then can be processed and made available externally via application programming interfaces (APIs) that we provide. Application developers can incorporate these APIs into their applications in order to receive data and analytics from us without needing to collect and process this data themselves. This approach means that the ACS platform has the extensibility to support additional use cases in the future. We expect to continue to expand the APIs and analytics that we make available from the ACS platform in order to encourage and enable an open application development environment to make possible compelling applications for our partners and customers. 
Products
We offer our solution to end customers as a portfolio of products that includes our hardware products, cloud-based network management and applications, and support services.
Our hardware products include Wi-Fi access points, branch routers and access switches. Our hardware design team develops our hardware products by working in conjunction with original design manufacturer, or ODM, partners, and leveraging the latest commercially available and economically viable Wi-Fi radios, processors, and switching chips. Our Wi-Fi access points run our proprietary HiveOS operating system. We generally sell our access switches and branch routers in conjunction with a sale of Wi-Fi access points. We also sell our Wi-Fi access points for use with other manufactures access switches.
Our cloud-based product offering includes HiveManager, our network management application, and our Mobility Suite, which includes our Guest Access, Personal Device Access, ID Manager, and Social Login applications. As described above, we continue to invest in our cloud platform and applications, including our next-generation network management application, HiveManager NG.
We offer tiered maintenance and support services under renewable, fee-based maintenance and support contracts, which include technical support, bug fixes, access to priority hardware replacement service and unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis. Our Software as a Service, or SaaS, subscriptions include comparable maintenance and support services.
We continue to look for new ways to package and deliver our product to best address customer demand and market opportunity. In January 2017, we introduced a new Aerohive Connect product line targeting customers with simpler connectivity-oriented use cases. Aerohive Connect packages together one of our entry-level access points, either the AP122 or AP130, a simplified version of HiveManager, and community/email-based customer support into a single product offered at a lower list price. Aerohive Connect is offered as a complement to, not a replacement for, our current full offering which we now refer to as Aerohive Select. Aerohive Select remains our flagship solution capable of addressing the most complete and demanding enterprise network, deployment, and security requirements. Aerohive Connect customers can easily upgrade from 
Connect to Select at any time with the purchase of an entitlement key that provides access to additional feature sets and support. We expect many customers who might otherwise not consider us to be attracted to the simplicity and low cost of Aerohive Connect but ultimately purchase Aerohive Select as a better match to their network requirements. Going forward we expect to look for other opportunities to package and monetize our product capabilities. 
Segment and Geographic Information
We operate one reporting segment and operating segment structure. We present financial information about our operating segment and geographic areas in Note 10 to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Customers
We sell our products through a network of authorized value-added resellers, or VARs, value-added distributors, or VADs, and managed service providers, or MSPs. Our products have been sold to over approximately 30,000 end-customers worldwide. We define end-customers as organizations holding or having held licenses to our products and software subscription and services. Our end-customers represent a broad range of industry verticals, including K-12 and higher education, distributed enterprises, retail and healthcare. In many cases, our target customers are installing a Wi-Fi network for the first time, or in parts of their organization that do not currently have Wi-Fi installed. In other cases, our customers already have a Wi-Fi network installed and our opportunity is to engage them in an expansion or replacement of their current solution. 
Sales
We use channel partners to sell and deliver our solutions to our end-user customers, which we support through our sales organization. Our field-based regional sales organization supports large-account acquisition and overall market development. Our centrally based inside sales teams focus on the acquisition of mid-market accounts in both the Enterprise and State & Local Government/Education segments. Our channel sales team recruits and manages channel partners. Our sales engineers have responsibility for pre-sales technical support, solutions engineering for our end-customers, and technical training for our channel partners. We continue to evaluate and adjust our sales headcount in our principal and emerging markets based on a combination of our current sales results and future sales potential. 
Our sales teams work with our channel partners who have networking, Wi-Fi and/or vertical market expertise to win and support end-customers through a direct-touch approach. Our VADs sell our products to and support our VARs, who then sell our products directly to end user customers, often with the addition of their own installation or professional services. We are increasingly working with MSPs, who bundle our product and service offerings with their own infrastructure and services to provide ongoing network operations and management to end-customers. This includes traditional VARs who are now expanding their services offering to include ongoing network management services. 
We extend our sales capabilities through strategic alliances with companies such as Juniper Networks and Dell. Our business with and through Dell showed significant growth across 2016 and we expect this alliance to be a meaningful contribution to our business going forward. 
Backlog 
We typically accept and ship orders for product and related services within a short time-frame. However, our partners may reschedule orders without penalty or we may delay shipment due to inventory constraints. As such, we do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is a reliable indicator of future revenue.
Research and Development
Continued investment in research and development is critical to our business. To this end, we have assembled a team of engineers with expertise in various fields, including networking platforms, cloud operations and applications, security systems, RF functions, user-interface design and open-source programming. We currently conduct our research and development efforts in California, Oregon and China. 
We have invested significant time and financial resources in the development of our products, including our ACS, HiveManager and our HiveOS platforms. We view continued investment in these capabilities as essential to our ability to differentiate ourselves in a competitive industry and to continue to be able to grow our business. For example, in 2015 we released HiveManager NG, our next-generation cloud services platform which provides a basis for data services and data analytic applications, and we released additional software modules to enhance the functionality and performance of our HiveOS operating system. In 2015, we announced our ACS platform which provides a secure and scalable cloud-based big data store for data collected from Aerohive network devices, other vendor devices, or other third-party sources, which can then be available to application developers to incorporate their API applications without needing to collect and process this data themselves. We also announced our Connected Experience platform that enables applications and insights that help our end-
customers' business and IT teams to unearth new data sources and opportunities for personalized access and engagement, increase productivity and efficiency and, ultimately, fuel a better customer experience, leading to business growth. 
We plan to continue to expand our product offerings and solutions capabilities in the future to dedicate significant resources to these research and development efforts.
Manufacturing 
We outsource the manufacturing of our hardware products to ODMs located in China and Taiwan. We believe that using original design manufacturers helps to optimize our operations by lowering costs, reducing time-to-market and enabling us to adjust to changing end-customer demand.
Our ODM partners ship finished products to our warehousing and delivery logistics centers in California and the Netherlands. We operate these logistic centers for all end-customer shipments, whether destined to locations in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, or Asia Pacific and Japan, or APAC. 
Our manufacturing partners procure components and assemble our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates at the time of future demand for our products, based upon historical trends and the assessment of our sales and product management functions of end-customer demand and overall market conditions. 
Our ODMs source the component parts within our products. We do not contract directly and do not have any long-term manufacturing contracts that guarantee us any fixed access to such component parts or specific pricing. This absence of direct and long-term component supply contracts may increase our exposure to shortages of component availability and to price increases which the ODM or supplier may charge in response to increased product demand or fluctuations related to the raw material inputs for such components. 
We continue to consolidate our manufacturing with our key manufacturers, and renegotiating those contractual relationships, to provide for longer termination notices and transition terms in the event we or they terminate our manufacturing relationship. We hope to increase our relative position and the significance of our relationships with those manufacturers, by concentrating our purchasing across a small number of manufacturers. 
Competition 
We operate in a competitive market for enterprise mobility and network-edge infrastructure, which continues to experience constant change and consolidation. Our competitors fall into two main groups:

• | General networking vendors, such as Cisco/Meraki, Hewlett-Packard/Aruba, and Brocade/Ruckus whose portfolios include enterprise mobility solutions and against whom we most commonly compete;


• | Independent Wi-Fi vendors, such as Ubiquiti and Xirrus, whose primary focus is on wireless access products but who have a smaller presence among our target markets and against whom we less frequently compete.

Trends in enterprise network infrastructures and mobility are all significantly increasing the importance of Wi-Fi to our target customers. As organizations address the proliferation of mobile devices, increased BYOD utilization, enterprise adoption of cloud and the adoption of mobile-first applications they compare competing wireless infrastructure produces, including:

• | ability to address specific customer use cases;


• | ease-of-use and simplicity of solutions;


• | price and total cost of ownership;


• | flexibility and feature-depth of solutions;


• | ability to meet deployment requirements;


• | capability to support business or customer-facing applications;


• | performance and scalability of products;


• | network survivability and reliability of solutions;


• | security of the network; and


• | for service providers, the ability to support business/operating models.

We believe that we generally compete favorably on the combined basis of all of these factors. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger sales and marketing budgets, broader distribution and established relationships with distribution partners and end-customers and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios which provide a greater ability to assemble, market, 
and aggressively price different capabilities across an integrated product platform. Other competitors are also working to grow their cloud networking capabilities, an area that has been one of our key differentiators. 
Seasonality 
See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information regarding seasonality of our business.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We rely on patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. As of December 31, 2016, we had 29 issued patents and 48 patent applications pending in the United States relating to our current and next-generation networking products, operating platform and cloud-based applications, and the ability to claim priority to most of the patent applications worldwide. Our first issued patents begin to expire in 2028. However, these patents or any patents that may issue to us in the future may be subject to re-examination, contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated, and we may or may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. We also license software from third parties for integration into our products, including open-source software. We believe our licenses are on commercially reasonable terms.
We utilize internal and external controls to restrict access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, end-customers and channel partners. Our software is also protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. However, despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and confidentiality agreements, third parties may still copy our products or otherwise gain access to or obtain and use our proprietary software and technology without our knowledge or authority or in ways we do not intend. 
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, and competitors increasingly may utilize litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights to protect or expand their market position. In particular, leading and more mature companies in the wireless networking industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation. As end customers increasingly use our products and services, and to the extent that we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims from third parties, not only from our competitors but also increasingly from non-operating entities, who will be more likely to claim that our platform infringes their proprietary rights, or to develop products and services that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights. From time-to-time, such third parties, including certain of these leading companies and, increasingly, non-operating entities, may assert patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners or our end-customers. In these instances, our standard license and other agreements may obligate us to indemnify our channel partners and end-customers against such claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services, require us to expend significant management attention and money to develop non-infringing solutions or force us to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees. This could include treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights.
In addition, our products utilize software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under open-source licenses, including as incorporated into software we receive from third party commercial software vendors. Some open-source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open-source software that we use. If we combine our proprietary software with open-source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open-source licenses, be required to release portions of the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This could allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time, and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us.
We cannot assure that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, or that we can resolve through litigation or on reasonable settlement terms, any such claims against us relating to any third-party patents or other proprietary rights, including relating to use of third-party open source software. See “Part I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings” and “Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors-Claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights could harm our business” for additional information.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 620 employees in offices in the Americas, EMEA and APAC. None of our employees is represented by labor unions, whether in the United States or abroad. We consider all current employee relations to be good. However, we continue to see employee turn-over, particularly amongst our employees in Silicon Valley where competition is typically high for sales and engineering personnel, and in Hangzhou China, where we currently maintain our principal research presence, where competition is high for highly skilled product development and engineering personnel.
