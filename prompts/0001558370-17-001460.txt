 Overview
 VIVUS is a biopharmaceutical company developing and commercializing innovative, next-generation therapies to address unmet medical needs in human health, with two approved therapies and one product candidate in active clinical development. Qsymia® (phentermine and topiramate extended release) is approved by FDA for chronic weight management and STENDRA® (avanafil) is approved by FDA for erectile dysfunction, or ED, and by the European Commission, or EC, under the trade name, SPEDRA, for the treatment of ED in the EU. Tacrolimus is in active clinical development for the treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, or PAH. Commercial Products
 Qsymia
 Qsymia was approved by FDA in July 2012, as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adult patients with an initial body mass index, or BMI, of 30 or greater, or obese patients, or who have a BMI of 27 or greater, or overweight patients, in the presence of at least one weight related comorbidity, such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus or high cholesterol, or dyslipidemia. Qsymia incorporates a proprietary formulation combining low doses of active ingredients from two previously approved drugs, phentermine and topiramate. Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, Qsymia is believed to suppress appetite and increase satiety, or the feeling of being full, the two main mechanisms that impact eating behavior.
 We commercialize Qsymia in the U.S. primarily through a sales force supported by an internal commercial team, who promote Qsymia to physicians. We are focused on maintaining a commercial presence with important Qsymia prescribers, and we have capacity to cover physicians that begin prescribing branded anti-obesity products. We are constantly monitoring prescribing activity in the market, and we have seen new prescriptions being written by health care professionals, or HCPs, with respect to whom we have not previously dedicated field sales resources.  The current alignment addresses this new prescriber group, and we believe we have been successful in initiating and maintaining dialog with these HCPs.
 Our marketing efforts have focused on rolling out unique programs to encourage targeted prescribers to gain more experience with Qsymia with their obese patient population. We continue to invest in digital media in order to amplify our messaging to information-seeking consumers. The digital messaging encourages those consumers most likely to take action to speak with their physicians about obesity treatment options. We believe our enhanced web-based strategies deliver clear and compelling communications to potential patients. In June 2016, we announced an upgraded simplified patient savings plan to further drive Qsymia brand preference at the point of prescription and encourage long-term use of the brand.
 STENDRA/SPEDRA
 STENDRA is an oral phosphodiesterase type 5, or PDE5, inhibitor that we have licensed from Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, or MTPC. STENDRA was approved by FDA in April 2012 for the treatment of ED in the United States. In June 2013, the EC adopted a decision granting marketing authorization for SPEDRA, the approved trade name for avanafil in the EU, for the treatment of ED in the EU. In July 2013, we entered into an agreement with the Menarini Group, through its subsidiary Berlin Chemie AG, or Menarini, under which Menarini received an exclusive license to commercialize and promote SPEDRA for the treatment of ED in over 40 European countries, including the EU, Australia and New Zealand. Menarini commenced its commercialization launch of the product in the EU in early 2014. As of the date of this filing, SPEDRA is commercially available in 30 countries within the territory granted to Menarini pursuant to its license and commercialization agreement, in addition to certain territories in Asia licensed directly from MTPC.

 On September 30, 2016, we entered into a license and commercialization agreement, or the Metuchen License Agreement, and a commercial supply agreement, or the Metuchen Supply Agreement, with Metuchen Pharmaceuticals LLC, or Metuchen. Under the terms of the Metuchen License Agreement, Metuchen received an exclusive license to develop, commercialize and promote STENDRA in the United States, Canada, South America and India, or the Metuchen Territory, effective October 1, 2016. These agreements with Metuchen replaced the license and supply agreements that we entered into with Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Auxilium, in October 2013, whereby Auxilium received an exclusive license to commercialize and promote STENDRA in the United States and Canada and we would supply Auxilium with STENDRA for commercialization. Auxilium terminated the supply agreement effective June 30, 2016 and the license agreement effective September 30, 2016.
 In December 2013, we entered into a license and commercialization agreement with Sanofi, or the Sanofi License Agreement, under which Sanofi received an exclusive license to commercialize and promote avanafil for therapeutic use in humans in Africa, the Middle East, Turkey, and the CIS, including Russia, or the Sanofi Territory. Sanofi was responsible for obtaining regulatory approval in its territories. Effective as of December 11, 2013, we also entered into a supply agreement, or the Sanofi Supply Agreement, with Sanofi Winthrop Industrie, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi, which terminated according to its terms on June 30, 2015.
 We are currently in discussions with potential collaboration partners to develop, market and sell STENDRA for territories in which we do not currently have a commercial collaboration, including Mexico and Central America.
 Development Programs
 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension - Tacrolimus 
 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, or PAH, is a chronic, life-threatening disease characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which are the arteries between the heart and lungs, due to severe constriction of these blood vessels.  Pulmonary blood pressure is normally between 8 and 20 mmHg at rest as measured by right heart catheterization; however, in patients with PAH, the pressure in the pulmonary artery is greater than 25 mmHg at rest or 30 mmHg during physical activity.  These high pressures make it difficult for the heart to pump blood through the lungs to be oxygenated.
 The prevalence of PAH varies among specific populations, but it is estimated at between 15 and 50 cases per million adults.  PAH usually develops between the ages of 20 and 60 but can occur at any age, with a mean age of diagnosis around 45 years.  Idiopathic PAH is the most common type, constituting approximately 40% of the total diagnosed PAH cases, and it occurs 2 to 4 times more frequently in females.
 The current medical therapies for PAH involve endothelin receptor antagonists, or ERA, phosphodiesterase-5, or PDE5, inhibitors, prostacyclin analogues, selective IP receptor agonists, and soluble guanylate cyclase, or sGC stimulators, which aim to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.  All currently approved products treat the symptoms of PAH, but do not address the underlying disease.  According to LifeSci Capital (Feb 2016 Analysis), the U.S. and worldwide markets for PAH pharmaceutical treatments in 2015 exceeded $2.7 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively.
 On January 6, 2017, we entered into a Patent Assignment Agreement with Selten Pharma, Inc., or Selten, whereby we received exclusive, worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of BMPR2 activators for the treatment of PAH and related vascular diseases.  As part of the agreement, Selten assigned to us its license to a group of patents owned by the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, or Stanford, which cover uses of tacrolimus and ascomycin to treat PAH. Tacrolimus received an Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of PAH on March 16, 2015. In 2017, we intend to focus on developing a proprietary formulation of tacrolimus to be used in a clinical development program and for commercial use.
 Qsymia for Additional Indications
 We are currently considering further development of Qsymia for the treatment of various diseases, including (i) obstructive sleep apnea, (ii) diabetes, (iii) nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, (iv) nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, also known as fatty liver disease, (v) hyperlipidemia, or an elevation of lipids, or fats, in the bloodstream, and 

 
  6

 
(vi) hypertension who do not respond well to antihypertensive medication. We expect no future development until we have concluded our discussions with FDA regarding a cardiovascular outcome trial, or CVOT, for Qsymia.
 Additional Opportunities
 We will continue to evaluate potential in-licensing opportunities to build our portfolio of product and product candidates.
 VIVUS was incorporated in California in 1991 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1996. Our corporate headquarters is located at 900 E. Hamilton Avenue, Suite 550, Campbell, California 95008, and our telephone number is (650) 934‑5200.

  Qsymia for the Treatment of Obesity
 Many factors contribute to excess weight gain. These include environmental factors, genetics, health conditions, certain medications, emotional factors and other behaviors. All this contributes to more than 110 million Americans being obese or overweight with at least one weight‑related comorbidity. Excess weight increases the risk of cardiometabolic and other conditions including type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart disease, sleep apnea, stroke and osteoarthritis. According to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, losing just 10% of body weight may help obese patients reduce the risk of developing other weight‑related medical conditions, while making a meaningful difference in health and well‑being.
 Qsymia for the treatment of obesity was approved as an adjunct to a reduced‑calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adult patients with an initial BMI of 30 or greater, or obese patients, or with a BMI of 27 or greater, or overweight patients, in the presence of at least one weight‑related comorbidity, such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus or high cholesterol, or dyslipidemia. Qsymia incorporates low doses of active 

 
  8

 
ingredients from two previously approved drugs, phentermine and topiramate. Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, Qsymia is believed to target appetite and satiety, or the feeling of being full, the two main mechanisms that impact eating behavior.
 Qsymia was approved with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, with a goal of informing prescribers and patients of reproductive potential regarding an increased risk of orofacial clefts in infants exposed to Qsymia during the first trimester of pregnancy, the importance of pregnancy prevention for females of reproductive potential receiving Qsymia and the need to discontinue Qsymia immediately if pregnancy occurs. The Qsymia REMS program includes a medication guide, patient brochure, voluntary healthcare provider training, distribution through certified home delivery and retail pharmacies, an implementation system and a time‑table for assessments.
 On July 20, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey issued a claim construction, or Markman, ruling governing the Qsymia Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, lawsuits.  The Court adopted our proposed constructions for all but one of the disputed claim terms and adopted a compromise construction that was acceptable to us for the final claim term.  Expert discovery is ongoing and no trial date has been scheduled.
 Upon receiving approval to market Qsymia, FDA required that we perform additional studies of Qsymia including a cardiovascular outcome trial, or CVOT.  To date, there have been no indications throughout the Qsymia clinical development program nor post-marketing experience of any increase in adverse cardiovascular events.  Given this historical information, along with the established safety profiles of phentermine and topiramate, we continue to believe that Qsymia poses no true cardiovascular safety risk. We met with FDA in May 2015 to discuss alternative strategies for obtaining cardiovascular, or CV, outcomes data that would be substantially more feasible and that ensure timely collection of data to better inform on the CV safety of Qsymia.  We worked with cardiovascular and epidemiology experts in exploring alternate solutions to demonstrate the long-term cardiovascular safety of Qsymia. After reviewing a summary of Phase 3 data relevant to CV risk and post-marketing safety data, the cardiology experts noted that they believe there was an absence of an overt CV risk signal and indicated that they did not believe a randomized placebo-controlled CVOT would provide additional information regarding the CV risk of Qsymia. The epidemiology experts maintained that a well-conducted retrospective observational study could provide data to further inform on potential CV risk. We worked with the expert group to develop a protocol and conduct a retrospective observational study. We are in the process of analyzing the collected information for discussion with FDA.  Although we and consulted experts believe there is no overt signal for CV risk to justify the CVOT, we are committed to working with FDA to reach a resolution.  There is no assurance, however, that FDA will accept any measures short of those specified in the CVOT to satisfy this requirement.
 In May 2013, the EC issued a decision refusing the grant of marketing authorization in the EU for Qsiva™, the approved trade name for Qsymia in the EU. In September 2013, we submitted a request to the EMA for Scientific Advice, a procedure similar to the U.S. Special Protocol Assessment process, regarding use of a pre-specified interim analysis from the CVOT to assess the long-term treatment effect of Qsymia on the incidence of major adverse CV events in overweight and obese subjects with confirmed CV disease. Our request was to allow this interim analysis to support the resubmission of an application for a marketing authorization for Qsiva for the treatment of obesity in accordance with the EU centralized marketing authorization procedure. We received feedback in 2014 from the EMA and the various competent authorities of the EU Member States associated with review of the CVOT protocol. As for the EU, even if FDA were to accept a retrospective observational study in lieu of a CVOT, there would be no assurance that the EMA would accept the same.
 Foreign regulatory approvals, including EC marketing authorization to market Qsiva in the EU, may not be obtained on a timely basis, or at all, and the failure to receive regulatory approvals in a foreign country would prevent us from marketing our products that have failed to receive such approval in that market, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 STENDRA for the Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction
 ED affects an estimated 52% of men between the ages of 40 and 70. Prevalence increases with age and can be caused by a variety of factors, including medications (anti‑hypertensives, histamine receptor antagonists); lifestyle (tobacco, alcohol use); diseases (diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, prostate cancer); and spinal cord injuries. Left untreated, ED can negatively impact relationships and self‑esteem, causing feelings of embarrassment and guilt. About 

 
  9

 
half of men being treated with currently available phosphodiesterase 5, or PDE5, inhibitors are dissatisfied with treatment.
 STENDRA is an oral PDE5 inhibitor we have licensed from MTPC. STENDRA was approved in the U.S. by FDA on April 27, 2012, for the treatment of ED. As part of the approval of STENDRA, we were committed to conduct two post‑approval clinical studies. The first was a randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, parallel group multicenter clinical trial on the effect of STENDRA on spermatogenesis in healthy adult males and males with mild ED. The other study was a double‑blind, randomized, placebo‑controlled, single‑dose clinical trial to assess the effects of STENDRA on multiple parameters of vision, including, but not limited to, visual acuity, intraocular pressure, pupillometry, and color vision discrimination in healthy male subjects. These studies are completed.
 On September 18, 2014, FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, for STENDRA. STENDRA is now indicated to be taken as early as approximately 15 minutes before sexual activity. On January 23, 2015, the EC adopted the commission implementing decision amending the marketing authorization for SPEDRA. SPEDRA is now approved in the EU to be taken as needed approximately 15 to 30 minutes before sexual activity.
 We have granted an exclusive license to Menarini to commercialize and promote SPEDRA for the treatment of ED in over 40 European countries, including the EU, plus Australia and New Zealand. We have granted an exclusive license to Metuchen to market STENDRA in the United States, Canada, South America and India. We have also granted an exclusive license to Sanofi to commercialize avanafil in Africa, the Middle East, Turkey, and the CIS, including Russia. We are currently in discussions with potential partners to commercialize STENDRA in other territories where we do not currently have a commercial collaboration under our license with MTPC, including Mexico and Central America.
 On July 27, 2016, we filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Hetero USA, Inc. and Hetero Labs Limited, collectively referred to as Hetero, in response to Hetero’s ANDA filing with FDA, requesting approval to market and sell generic versions of the currently approved doses of STENDRA tablets prior to the expiration of U.S. Patents 6,656,935 and 7,501,409, collectively referred to as the Asserted Patents. On January 3, 2017, we entered into a settlement agreement with Hetero, or the Settlement Agreement.  Under the Settlement Agreement, Hetero was granted a license to manufacture and commercialize the generic version of STENDRA described in its ANDA filing in the United States as of the date that is the later of (a) October 29, 2024, which is 180 days prior to the expiration of the last to expire of the Asserted Patents, or (b) the date that Hetero obtains final approval from FDA of the Hetero ANDA. The Settlement Agreement provides for a full settlement of all claims that were asserted in the suit. As required by law, the Settlement Agreement was submitted to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Department of Justice.
 Tacrolimus for the Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
 PAH is a chronic life-threatening disease characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries (arteries between the heart and lungs) due to severe constriction of these blood vessels.  Pulmonary blood pressure is normally between 8 and 20 mmHg at rest as measured by right heart catheterization; however, in patients with PAH, the pressure in the pulmonary artery is greater than 25 mmHg at rest or 30 mmHg during physical activity.  These high pressures make it difficult for the heart to pump blood through the lungs to be oxygenated.
 The prevalence of PAH varies among specific populations, but it is estimated at between 15 and 50 cases per million adults.  PAH usually develops between the ages of 20 and 60, but can occur at any age with a mean age of diagnosis around 45 years.  Idiopathic PAH is the most common type constituting approximately 40% of the total PAH cases, and it occurs 2 to 4 times more frequently in females.  Risk factors for PAH include a family history of PAH, congenital heart disease, connective tissue disease, portal hypertension, sickle cell disease, thyroid disease, HIV infection, and use of certain drugs and toxins.  PAH patients are classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as class 1, 2, 3, or 4, with the most impaired patients being class 4.
 The symptoms of PAH are non-specific and thus are unfortunately most frequently diagnosed when patients have reached an advanced stage of the disease.  Early symptoms may include shortness of breath during routine activity, fatigue, chest pain, racing heartbeat, pain in upper right side of abdomen, and decreased appetite.  As PAH progresses and worsens, symptoms may include feeling light-headed (especially during physical activity), fainting, swelling in the ankles or legs, and bluish lips or skin.  At its worse point, the patient develops right heart failure and is routinely 

 
  10

 
hospitalized to manage their progressing disease which may ultimately lead to death.  Currently, lung transplantation is the only option for patients who are not responsive to medical therapy.
 The current medical therapies for PAH involve endothelin receptor antagonists, or ERA, phosphodiesterase-5, or PDE5, inhibitors, prostacyclin analogues, selective IP receptor agonists, and soluble guanylate cyclase, or sGC stimulators, which aim to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.  All currently approved products treat the symptoms of PAH, but do not address the underlying disease.  According to LifeSci Capital (Feb 2016 Analysis), the U.S. and worldwide markets for PAH pharmaceutical treatments in 2015 exceeded $2.7 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively.
 We believe that bone morphogenic protein receptor 2, or BMPR2, signaling could inhibit vascular smooth muscle proliferation.  Reduced BMPR2 expression, including loss-of-function mutations in BMPR2, is prevalent in PAH patients and may contribute to smooth muscle proliferation. Studies have shown that low doses of tacrolimus have restored BMPR2 signaling and reversed proliferative effects in animal models. We believe that enhancement of BMPR2 signaling with tacrolimus may address a fundamental cause of PAH.
 On March 16, 2015, tacrolimus for the treatment of PAH received an Orphan Drug Designation.  An Orphan Drug Designation can provide benefits to us, such as: tax credits on clinical research, simplification of administrative procedures (reduction of the waiting period and reduction of the amount of registration fees), and marketing exclusivity of seven years after the marketing approval is granted for the approved orphan indication.
 Stanford completed a randomized, double-blind Phase 2a with 23 class 1 and 2 PAH patients titrated to target blood levels.  All target blood levels were well tolerated with no drug related serious adverse events, nephrotoxicity or incident diabetes.  In addition, Stanford provided tacrolimus for compassionate use in three class 3 or 4 PAH patients.  The compassionate use demonstrated dramatically reduced rates of hospitalizations and functional class improvements were observed.
 On January 6, 2017, we entered into a Patent Assignment Agreement with Selten, whereby we received exclusive, worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of BMPR2 activators for the treatment of PAH and related vascular diseases.  As part of the agreement, Selten assigned to us its license to a group of patents owned by Stanford which cover uses of tacrolimus and ascomycin to treat PAH. We are responsible for future financial obligations to Stanford under that license.
 We have also assumed full responsibility for the development and commercialization of the licensed compounds for the treatment of PAH and related vascular diseases. Selten received an upfront payment of $1.0 million and is entitled to receive milestone payments based on global development status and future sales milestones, as well as tiered royalty payments on future sales of these compounds.  The total potential milestone payments are $39.0 million to Selten and $550,000 to Stanford. The majority of the milestone payments to Selten may be paid, at our sole option, either in cash or our common stock, provided that in no event shall the payment of common stock exceed fifty percent of the aggregate amount of such milestone payments.
 Other Programs
 We have licensed and intend to continue to license from third parties the rights to other investigational drug candidates to treat various diseases and medical conditions. We expect to continue to use our expertise in designing and conducting clinical trials, formulation and investigational drug candidate development to commercialize pharmaceuticals for unmet medical needs or for disease states that are underserved by currently approved drugs. We intend to develop products with a proprietary position or that complement our other products currently under development, although there can be no assurance that any of these investigational product candidates will be successfully developed and approved by regulatory authorities. Government Regulations
 FDA Regulation
 Prescription pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre‑ and post‑marketing regulation by FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and its implementing regulations govern, among other things, requirements for 

 
  11

 
the testing, development, manufacturing, quality control, safety, efficacy, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of drug products.
 The activities required before a pharmaceutical agent may be marketed in the U.S. begin with pre‑clinical testing. Pre‑clinical tests generally include laboratory evaluation of potential products and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product and its formulations. The results of these studies and other information must be submitted to FDA as part of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must be reviewed by FDA before proposed clinical testing in human volunteers can begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, which establishes standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting results of, clinical trials, and are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible, accurate, and that the rights, safety and well‑being of study participants are protected. Clinical trials must be under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical study must be conducted under the auspices of an independent institutional review board, or IRB. The IRB will consider, among other things, regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from study subjects, as well as other ethical factors and the safety of human patients. The sponsoring company, FDA, or the IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 Typically, human clinical trials are conducted in three phases that may overlap. In Phase 1, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of patients to determine the early safety profile and pharmacology of the new therapy. In Phase 2, clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease or medical condition in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. In Phase 3, large‑scale, multicenter clinical trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease or medical condition in order to provide substantial evidence of efficacy and safety required by FDA and others.
 The results of the pre‑clinical and clinical testing, together with chemistry and manufacturing information, are submitted to FDA in the form of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for a pharmaceutical product in order to obtain approval to commence commercial sales. In responding to an NDA, FDA may grant marketing approvals, may request additional information or further research or studies, or may deny the application if it determines that the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria. FDA approval for a pharmaceutical product may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Under the goals and policies agreed to by FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, FDA has twelve months in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and eight months for a priority NDA. FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates and in certain circumstances, the review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended. A subsequent application for approval of an additional indication must also be reviewed by FDA under the same criteria as apply to original applications, and may be denied as well. In addition, even if FDA approval is granted, it may not cover all the clinical indications for which approval is sought or may contain significant limitations in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications with respect to conditions of use. In addition, FDA may require the development and implementation of a REMS to address specific safety issues at the time of approval or after marketing of the product. A REMS may, for instance, restrict distribution and impose burdensome implementation requirements. Our approved product Qsymia is subject to a REMS program.
 Satisfaction of FDA premarket approval requirements for new drugs typically takes several years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or targeted disease. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and may impose costly procedures upon our activities. Success in early‑stage clinical trials or with prior versions of products does not assure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.
 Once approved, products are subject to continuing regulation by FDA. FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with post‑marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, FDA may require companies to conduct post‑marketing studies or trials, referred to as PMRs, to evaluate safety issues related to the approved product, and may withdraw approval or impose marketing restrictions based on the results of PMR studies or trials or other relevant data. FDA has required us to perform PMR studies and trials for both of our approved products, Qsymia and STENDRA. FDA has broad post‑market regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy civil monetary penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize 

 
  12

 
or recall products, or withdraw approvals. Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 requires all applicable clinical trials we conduct for our investigational drug candidates, both before and after approval, and the results of those applicable clinical trials when available, to be included in a clinical trials registry database that is available and accessible to the public via the Internet. Our failure to properly participate in the clinical trial database registry may subject us to significant civil penalties.
 Facilities used to manufacture drugs are subject to periodic inspection by FDA, and other authorities where applicable, and must comply with FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP regulations. Compliance with cGMP includes adhering to requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, and records and reports. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product or voluntary recall of a product.
 FDA imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, which include, among other things, standards and regulations relating to direct‑to‑consumer advertising, off‑label promotion, industry‑sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by FDA. FDA has very broad enforcement authority. Failure to abide by these regulations can result in adverse publicity, and/or enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter directing the entity to correct deviations from FDA standards, and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products.
 Companies that manufacture or distribute drug products or that hold approved NDAs must comply with other regulatory requirements, including submitting annual reports, reporting information about adverse drug experiences, and maintaining certain records. In addition, we are subject to various laws and regulations regarding the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our manufacture and research. In each of these areas, as noted above, the government has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect upon us.
 Other Government Regulations
 In addition to laws and regulations enforced by FDA, we are also subject to regulation under NIH guidelines as well as under the Controlled Substances Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future federal, state or local laws and regulations, as our research and development may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, viruses and various radioactive compounds.
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials, commercial sales, and distribution of our investigational drug candidates. We must obtain separate approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence marketing of the product in those countries. For example, in the EU, the conduct of clinical trials is governed by Directive 2001/20/EC which imposes obligations and procedures that are similar to those provided in applicable U.S. laws. The European Union Good Clinical Practice rules, or GCP, and EU Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, obligations must also be respected during conduct of the trials. Clinical trials must be approved by the competent authorities and the competent Ethics Committees in the EU Member States in which the clinical trials take place. A clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to each EU Member State’s national health authority. Moreover, an application for a positive opinion must be submitted to the competent Ethics Committee prior to commencement of clinical trials of a medicinal product. The competent authorities of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is conducted must authorize the conduct of the trial and the competent Ethics Committees must grant their positive opinion prior to commencement of a clinical trial in an EU Member State. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.

 To obtain marketing approval of a medicinal product in the EU, we would be required to submit marketing authorization applications based on the ICH Common Technical Document to the competent authorities, and must demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of our medicinal products. This would require us to conduct human clinical trials to generate the necessary clinical data. Moreover, we would be required to demonstrate in our application that studies have been conducted with the medicinal product in the pediatric population as provided by a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, approved by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA. Alternatively, confirmation that we have been granted a waiver or deferral from the conduct of these studies must be provided.
 Medicinal products are authorized in the EU in one of two ways, either by the competent authorities of the EU Member States through the decentralized procedure or mutual recognition procedure, or through the centralized procedure by the European Commission following a positive opinion by the EMA. The authorization process is essentially the same irrespective of which route is used.
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU Member States. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. It is optional for those products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients. Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases. These are defined as circumstances in which a medicinal product is expected to be of a “major public health interest.” Three cumulative criteria must be fulfilled in such circumstances: the seriousness of the disease, such as heavy disabling or life‑threatening diseases, to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In these circumstances, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
 The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other (“concerned”) EU Member States of an assessment of an application for marketing authorization conducted by one EU Member State, known as the reference EU Member State. In accordance with this procedure, an applicant submits an application for marketing authorization to the reference EU Member State and the concerned EU Member States. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States. In accordance with the mutual recognition procedure, the sponsor applies for national marketing authorization in one EU Member State. Upon receipt of this authorization the sponsor can then seek the recognition of this authorization by other EU Member States. Authorization in accordance with either of these procedures will result in authorization of the medicinal product only in the reference EU Member State and in the other concerned EU Member States.
 Innovative medicinal products authorized in the EU on the basis of a full marketing authorization application (as opposed to an application for marketing authorization that relies on data available in the marketing authorization dossier for another, previously approved, medicinal product) are entitled to eight years’ data exclusivity. During this period, applicants for authorization of generics or biosimilars of these innovative products cannot rely on data contained in the marketing authorization dossier submitted for the innovative medicinal product. Innovative medicinal products are also entitled to ten years’ market exclusivity. During this ten year period no generic or biosimilar of this medicinal product can be placed on the EU market. The ten‑year period of market exclusivity can be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the Marketing Authorization Holder for the innovative product obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 Similarly to the U.S., marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and/or the competent authorities of the EU Member States. This oversight applies both before and after grant of manufacturing and marketing authorizations. It includes control of compliance with EU GMP rules and pharmacovigilance rules. We cannot guarantee that we would be able to comply with the post‑marketing obligations imposed as part of the marketing authorization for SPEDRA. Failure to comply with 

 
  14

 
these requirements may lead to the suspension, variation or withdrawal of the marketing authorization for SPEDRA in the EU.
 In the EU, the advertising and promotion of our products will also be subject to EU Member States’ laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, as well as other EU Member State legislation that may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the medicinal product. It forms an intrinsic and integral part of the marketing authorization granted for the medicinal product. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off‑label promotion. The off‑label promotion of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The applicable laws at the EU level and in the individual EU Member States also prohibit the direct‑to‑consumer advertising of prescription‑only medicinal products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict communications concerning the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
 Failure to comply with the EU Member State laws implementing the Community Code on medicinal products, and EU rules governing the promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, with the EU Member State laws that apply to the promotion of medicinal products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti‑corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the EU Member State authorities, which may include any of the following: fines, imprisonment, orders forfeiting products or prohibiting or suspending their supply to the market, or requiring the manufacturer to issue public warnings, or to conduct a product recall.
 Interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self‑regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct in the individual EU Member States. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti‑bribery laws of the EU Member States. One example is the UK Bribery Act 2010. This Act applies to any company incorporated in or “carrying on business” in the UK, irrespective of where in the world the alleged bribery activity occurs. This Act could have implications for our interactions with physicians in and outside the UK. Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.
 Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publically disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
 United States Healthcare Reform
 In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to in this report as the Affordable Care Act was adopted in the United States. This law substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions that are expected to impact our business and operations. Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges, expansion of the 340B program, and fraud and abuse and enforcement. These changes will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program.
 The Affordable Care Act made significant changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Effective March 23, 2010, rebate liability expanded from fee‑for‑service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed 

 
  15

 
care organizations as well. With regard to the amount of the rebates owed, the Affordable Care Act increased the minimum Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price for most innovator products and from 11% to 13% for non‑innovator products; changed the calculation of the rebate for certain innovator products that qualify as line extensions of existing drugs; and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the average manufacturer price. In addition, the Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation changed the definition of average manufacturer price. In February 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, the federal agency that administers Medicare and the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the Affordable Care Act. These regulations become effective on April 1, 2016. In addition, the Affordable Care Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government beginning in 2011. Each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee of $3.0 billion in 2016, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law.
 Additional provisions of the Affordable Care Act may negatively affect our revenues in the future. For example, as part of the Affordable Care Act’s provisions closing a coverage gap that currently exists in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program, or the donut hole, manufacturers are required to provide a 50% discount on branded prescription drugs dispensed to beneficiaries within this donut hole. We currently do not have coverage under Medicare Part D for our drugs, but this could change in the future.
 Moreover, legislative changes to the Affordable Care Act remain possible and appear likely in the 115th United States Congress and under the Trump Administration. We expect that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of our existing products or to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved.
 The Affordable Care Act also expanded the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing discount program. The 340B pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. The Affordable Care Act expanded the 340B program to include additional types of covered entities: certain free‑standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, each as defined by the Affordable Care Act, but exempts “orphan drugs” from the ceiling price requirements for these covered entities. The Affordable Care Act also obligates the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to update the agreement that manufacturers must sign to participate in the 340B program to obligate a manufacturer to offer the 340B price to covered entities if the manufacturer makes the drug available to any other purchaser at any price and to report to the government the ceiling prices for its drugs.  The Health Resources and Services Administration, or HRSA, the agency that administers the 340B program, recently initiated the process of updating the agreement with participating manufacturers. The Healthcare Reform Act also obligates the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to create regulations and processes to improve the integrity of the 340B program.  In 2015, HRSA issued proposed omnibus guidance that addresses many aspects of the 340B program, and in August 2016, HRSA issued a proposed regulation regarding an administrative dispute resolution process for the 340B program.  It is unclear when or whether the guidance or regulation will be released in final form under the Trump Administration.  On January 5, 2017, HRSA issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities. The March 6, 2017 effective date of this regulation is subject to a temporary delay directed by the Trump Administration, and the regulation could be subject to further delay or other modification by the Trump Administration. Implementation of this final rule and the issuance of any other final regulations and guidance could affect our obligations under the 340B program in ways we cannot anticipate.  In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in an inpatient setting.
 Some states have elected not to expand their Medicaid programs by raising the income limit to 133% of the federal poverty level as permitted under the Affordable Care Act. For each state that does not choose to expand its Medicaid program, there may be fewer insured patients overall, which could impact our sales, business and financial condition.

 Coverage and Reimbursement
 In both U.S. and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our products successfully and to attract commercialization partners for our products, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third‑party payors, including, in the United States, governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. Third‑party payors decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement and co‑pay levels. Third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medicines and examining their cost‑effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost‑effectiveness of our products. Even with studies, our products may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost‑effective than existing products, and third‑party payors may not provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, in whole or in part.
 Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. We anticipate that the United States Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These cost‑containment measures include: controls on government funded reimbursement for drugs; new or increased requirements to pay prescription drug rebates to government healthcare programs; controls on healthcare providers; challenges to the pricing of drugs or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means; requirements to try less expensive products or generics before a more expensive branded product; changes in drug importation laws; expansion of use of managed care systems in which healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person; and public funding for cost‑effectiveness research, which may be used by government and private third‑party payors to make coverage and payment decisions. Further, federal budgetary concerns could result in the implementation of significant federal spending cuts, including cuts in Medicare and other health related spending in the near‑term. For example, beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services, including drugs and biologics, were reduced by 2% under the sequestration (i.e., automatic spending reductions) required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.  Subsequent legislation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2025.  These cuts reduce reimbursement payments related to our products, which could potentially negatively impact our revenue.
 Payors also are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price and Actual Acquisition Cost. The existing data for reimbursement based on these metrics is relatively limited, although certain states have begun to survey acquisition cost data for the purpose of setting Medicaid reimbursement rates. CMS surveys and publishes retail community pharmacy acquisition cost information in the form of National Average Drug Acquisition Cost, or NADAC, files to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis of comparison for their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates. It may be difficult to project the impact of these evolving reimbursement mechanics on the willingness of payors to cover our products.
 We participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and amended by the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 as well as subsequent legislation. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates are based on pricing data reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS. These data include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug.
 Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing discount program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low‑income patients. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Changes to the definition of average manufacturer price and the Medicaid Drug Rebate 

 
  17

 
amount under the Affordable Care Act and CMS’s issuance of final regulations implementing those changes also could affect our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations.
 In order to be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and certain federal grantees, we participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program, established by Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. Under this program, we are obligated to make our product available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agencies—VA, Department of Defense, Public Health Service, and Coast Guard—that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price, or FCP. The FCP is based on the non‑federal average manufacturer price, or Non‑FAMP, which we calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. We also participate in the Tricare Retail Pharmacy program, established by Section 703 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2008, and related regulations, under which we pay quarterly rebates on utilization of innovator products that are dispensed to Tricare beneficiaries. The rebates are calculated as the difference between Annual Non‑FAMP and FCP.
 We expect to experience pricing pressures in the United States in connection with the sale of our products due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals. In various EU countries, we expect to be subject to continuous cost‑cutting measures, such as lower maximum prices, lower or lack of reimbursement coverage and incentives to use cheaper, usually generic, products as an alternative.
 We are unable to predict what additional legislation, regulations or policies, if any, relating to the healthcare industry or third‑party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation, regulations or policies would have on our business. Any cost‑containment measures, including those listed above, or other healthcare system reforms that are adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate profitably.
 Once an applicant receives marketing authorization in an EU Member State, through any application route, the applicant is then required to engage in pricing discussions and negotiations with a separate pricing authority in that country. The legislators, policymakers and healthcare insurance funds in the EU Member States continue to propose and implement cost‑containing measures to keep healthcare costs down, due in part to the attention being paid to healthcare cost‑containment and other austerity measures in the EU. Certain of these changes could impose limitations on the prices pharmaceutical companies are able to charge for their products. The amounts of reimbursement available from governmental agencies or third‑party payors for these products may increase the tax obligations on pharmaceutical companies such as ours, or may facilitate the introduction of generic competition with respect to our products. Furthermore, an increasing number of EU Member States and other foreign countries use prices for medicinal products established in other countries as “reference prices” to help determine the price of the product in their own territory. Consequently, a downward trend in prices of medicinal products in some countries could contribute to similar downward trends elsewhere. In addition, the ongoing budgetary difficulties faced by a number of EU Member States, including Greece and Spain, have led and may continue to lead to substantial delays in payment and payment partially with government bonds rather than cash for medicinal products, which could negatively impact our revenues and profitability. Moreover, in order to obtain reimbursement of our medicinal products in some countries, including some EU Member States, we may be required to conduct Health Technology Assessments, or HTAs, that compare the cost‑effectiveness of our products to other available therapies. There can be no assurance that our medicinal products will obtain favorable reimbursement status in any country.
 In the EU, the sole legal instrument at the EU level governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products is Council Directive 89/105/EEC, or the Price Transparency Directive. The aim of this Directive is to ensure that pricing and reimbursement mechanisms established in the EU Member States are transparent and objective, do not hinder the free movement and trade of medicinal products in the EU and do not hinder, prevent or distort competition on the market. The Price Transparency Directive does not provide any guidance concerning the specific criteria on the basis of which pricing and reimbursement decisions are to be made in individual EU Member States. Neither does it have any direct consequence for pricing nor reimbursement levels in individual EU Member States. The EU Member States are free to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices and/or reimbursement levels of medicinal products for human use. An EU Member State may approve a specific price or level of reimbursement for the medicinal product, or alternatively adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company responsible for placing the medicinal product on the market, including volume‑based arrangements and reference pricing mechanisms.

 
  18

 

 Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States. These EU Member States include the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Sweden. The HTA process in the EEA Member States is governed by the national laws of these countries. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost‑effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market.
 The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product vary between EU Member States.
 In 2011, Directive 2011/24/EU was adopted at the EU level. This Directive concerns the application of patients’ rights in cross‑border healthcare. The Directive is intended to establish rules for facilitating access to safe and high‑quality cross‑border healthcare in the EU. It also provides for the establishment of a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual EU Member States. The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs. This could lead to harmonization between EU Member States of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTA and their impact on pricing and reimbursement decisions.
 Fraud and Abuse and Privacy and Data Security Laws and Regulations
 The healthcare industry, and thus our business, is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change. Both federal and state governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts.
 The restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and privacy and data security laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:

· | the federal Anti‑Kickback Law, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly or willingly offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare items or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Further, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, clarified that liability may be established under the federal Anti‑Kickback Law without proving actual knowledge of the federal Anti‑Kickback statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act amended the Social Security Act to provide that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti‑Kickback Law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti‑Kickback Law protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that do not fit squarely within an exemption or safe harbor may be subject to scrutiny. We seek to comply with the exemptions and safe harbors whenever possible, but our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti‑kickback liability;

· | the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Many pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been investigated and have reached substantial

financial settlements with the federal government under the civil False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper marketing activities, including providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; providing consulting fees, grants, free travel, and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe the company’s products; and inflating prices reported to private price publication services, which are used to set drug payment rates under government healthcare programs. In addition, in recent years the government has pursued civil False Claims Act cases against a number of pharmaceutical companies for causing false claims to be submitted as a result of the marketing of their products for unapproved, and thus non‑reimbursable, uses. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claim laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non‑government health benefit programs;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information. In addition, most healthcare providers who prescribe our products and from whom we obtain patient health information are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, which are collectively referred to as HIPAA. We are not a HIPAA‑covered entity and we do not operate as a business associate to any covered entities. Therefore, the HIPAA privacy and security requirements do not apply to us (other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits). However, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA or for aiding and abetting and/or conspiring to commit a violation of HIPAA. We are unable to predict whether our actions could be subject to prosecution in the event of an impermissible disclosure of health information to us. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information. The collection and use of personal health data and other personal data in the EU is governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive as implemented into national laws by the EU Member States. This Directive imposes restrictions on the processing (e.g., collection, use, disclosure) of personal data, including a number of requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals prior to processing their personal data, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The Data Protection Directive also imposes strict restrictions on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an EU-wide regulation that will be fully enforceable by May 25, 2018, will introduce new data protection requirements in the EU and substantial fines for violations of the data protection rules. The GDPR will increase our responsibility and liability in relation to EU personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new EU data protection rules. This may be onerous and increase our cost of doing business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data security continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data security issues with the potential to affect our business. These privacy and data security laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. Moreover, patients about whom we or our partners obtain information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may have contractual rights that limit our ability to use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals' privacy rights or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business;

· | analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti‑kickback and false claims laws, may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Some state laws also require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the

marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to certain health care providers in the states. Other states prohibit providing meals to prescribers or other marketing‑related activities. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes of conduct. Foreign governments often have similar regulations, which we also will be subject to in those countries where we market and sell products;

· | the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain pharmaceutical manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and to submit such data to CMS, which will then make all of this data publicly available on the CMS website. Pharmaceutical manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program are required to have started tracking reportable payments on August 1, 2013, and must submit a report to CMS on or before the 90th day of each calendar year disclosing reportable payments made in the previous calendar year.

· | the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and other similar anti‑bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties, or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in anti‑bribery law enforcement activity by U.S. regulators, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with United States or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third‑party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or government investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence.

  If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws or regulations described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government‑funded healthcare programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws and regulations, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, data security and fraud laws and regulations may prove costly.
 Collaboration Agreements
 Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation
 In January 2001, we entered into an exclusive development, license and clinical trial and commercial supply agreement with MTPC for the development and commercialization of avanafil, a PDE5 inhibitor compound for the oral and local treatment of male and female sexual dysfunction. Under the terms of the agreement, MTPC agreed to grant an exclusive license to us for products containing avanafil outside of Japan, North Korea, South Korea, China, Taiwan, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines. We agreed to grant MTPC an exclusive, royalty‑free license within those countries for oral products that we develop containing avanafil. In addition, we agreed to grant MTPC an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive, royalty‑bearing license within those countries for non‑oral products that we develop containing avanafil. MTPC agreed to manufacture and supply us with avanafil for use in clinical trials, which were our primary responsibility. The MTPC agreement contains a number of milestone payments to be made by us based on various triggering events.

 
  21

 

 The term of the MTPC agreement is based on a country‑by‑country and on a product‑by‑product basis. The term shall continue until the later of 10 years after the date of the first sale for a particular product or the expiration of the last‑to‑expire patents within the MTPC patents covering such product in such country. In the event that our product is deemed to be insufficiently effective or insufficiently safe relative to other PDE5 inhibitor compounds based on published information or not economically feasible to develop due to unforeseen regulatory hurdles or costs as measured by standards common in the pharmaceutical industry for this type of product, we have the right to terminate the agreement with MTPC with respect to such product.
 In August 2012, we entered into an amendment to our agreement with MTPC that permits us to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and tablets for STENDRA ourselves or through third parties. In 2015, we transferred the manufacturing of the API and tablets for STENDRA to Sanofi.
 On February 21, 2013, we entered into the third amendment to our agreement with MTPC which, among other things, expands our rights, or those of our sublicensees, to enforce the patents licensed under the MTPC agreement against alleged infringement, and clarifies the rights and duties of the parties and our sublicensees upon termination of the MTPC agreement. In addition, we were obligated to use our best commercial efforts to market STENDRA in the U.S. by December 31, 2013, which was achieved by our former commercialization partner, Auxilium.
 On July 23, 2013, we entered into the fourth amendment to our agreement with MTPC which, among other things, changes the definition of net sales used to calculate royalties owed by us to MTPC.
 Menarini Group
 On July 5, 2013, we entered into a license and commercialization agreement, or the Menarini License Agreement, and a supply agreement, or the Menarini Supply Agreement, with the Menarini Group through its subsidiary Berlin‑Chemie AG, or Menarini.
 Under the terms of the Menarini License Agreement, Menarini received an exclusive license to commercialize and promote our drug SPEDRA for the treatment of ED in over 40 countries, including the EU, plus Australia and New Zealand. Additionally, we agreed to transfer to Menarini ownership of the marketing authorization for SPEDRA in the EU for the treatment of ED, which was granted by the EC in June 2013. Each party agreed not to develop, commercialize, or in‑license any other product that operates as phosphodiesterase type‑5 inhibitor for the treatment of ED for a limited time period, subject to certain exceptions.
 Under the Menarini License Agreement, we have received payments of $63.0 million relating to license and milestone payments and royalty prepayments through December 31, 2016.  Additionally, we are entitled to receive potential milestone payments based on certain net sales targets, plus royalties on SPEDRA sales. Menarini will also reimburse us for payments made to cover various obligations to MTPC during the term of the Menarini License Agreement. The Menarini License Agreement will terminate on a country‑by‑country basis in the relevant territories upon the latest to occur of the following: (i) the expiration of the last‑to‑expire valid VIVUS patent covering SPEDRA; (ii) the expiration of data protection covering SPEDRA; or (iii) 10 years after the SPEDRA product launch. In addition, Menarini may terminate the Menarini License Agreement if certain additional regulatory obligations are imposed on SPEDRA, and we may terminate the Menarini License Agreement if Menarini challenges our patents covering SPEDRA or if Menarini commits certain legal violations. Either party may terminate the Menarini License Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy.
 Under the terms of the Menarini Supply Agreement, we will supply Menarini with STENDRA drug product until December 31, 2018. Menarini also has the right to manufacture STENDRA independently, provided that it continues to satisfy certain minimum purchase obligations to us. Following the expiration of the Menarini Supply Agreement, Menarini will be responsible for its own supply of STENDRA. Either party may terminate the Menarini Supply Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy, or upon the termination of the Menarini License Agreement.
 Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 On October 10, 2013, we entered into a license and commercialization agreement, or the Auxilium License Agreement, and a commercial supply agreement, or the Auxilium Supply Agreement, with Auxilium. On January 29, 

 
  22

 
2015, Auxilium was purchased by Endo International, plc. Under the terms of the Auxilium License Agreement, Auxilium received an exclusive license to commercialize and promote our drug STENDRA for the treatment of ED in the United States and Canada and their respective territories, or the Auxilium Territory.
 We received an upfront license fee of $30.0 million in October 2013 and a regulatory milestone payment of $15.0 million in 2014 upon approval by FDA of a specific time of onset claim for STENDRA in the Auxilium Territory. Additionally, we have received royalty payments based on tiered percentages of the aggregate annual net sales of STENDRA in the Auxilium Territory on a quarterly basis.
 Auxilium obtained STENDRA exclusively from us for a mutually agreed term pursuant to the Auxilium Supply Agreement, as further described below. Auxilium may elect to transfer the control of the supply chain for STENDRA for the Auxilium Territory to itself or its designee by assigning to Auxilium our agreements with the contract manufacturer, which is referred to below as the Supply Chain Transfer.
 Auxilium terminated the Auxilium Supply Agreement effective June 30, 2016 and the Auxilium License Agreement effective September 30, 2016.
 Sanofi
 On December 11, 2013, we entered into the Sanofi License Agreement with Sanofi. Effective as of December 11, 2013, we entered into the Sanofi Supply Agreement with Sanofi Winthrop Industrie, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi, which terminated according to its terms on June 30, 2015. Under the terms of the Sanofi License Agreement, Sanofi received an exclusive license to commercialize and promote avanafil for therapeutic use in humans in the Sanofi Territory.
 In December 2013, we received an upfront license fee of $5.0 million and a $1.5 million manufacturing milestone payment, and in February 2014, we received an additional $3.5 million in manufacturing milestone payments. We were also eligible to receive up to $6.0 million in regulatory milestone payments, and up to $45.0 million in sales milestone payments, plus royalties on avanafil sales based on tiered percentages of the aggregate annual net sales in the Sanofi Territory.
 On July 31, 2013, we entered into a Commercial Supply Agreement with Sanofi Chimie to manufacture and supply the API for our drug avanafil on an exclusive basis in the United States and other territories and on a semi‑exclusive basis in Europe, including the EU, Latin America and other territories. On November 18, 2013, we entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Sanofi Winthrop Industrie to manufacture and supply the avanafil tablets on an exclusive basis in the United States and other territories and on a semi‑exclusive basis in Europe, including the EU, Latin America and other territories. We have obtained approval from FDA and the EMA for Sanofi Chimie to be a qualified supplier of avanafil API and of Sanofi Winthrop Industrie as a qualified supplier of the avanafil tablets. We have minimum annual purchase commitments under these agreements for at least the initial five‑year terms.
 Metuchen Pharmaceuticals, LLC
 On September 30, 2016, we entered into the Metuchen License Agreement and the Metuchen Supply Agreement with Metuchen. Under the terms of the Metuchen License Agreement, Metuchen received an exclusive, license to develop, commercialize and promote STENDRA in the Metuchen Territory, effective October 1, 2016. We and Metuchen have agreed not to develop, commercialize, or in-license any other product that operates as a PDE-5 inhibitor in the Metuchen Territory for a limited time period, subject to certain exceptions. The license agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the last-to-expire payment obligations under the license agreement; upon expiration of the term of the license agreement, the exclusive license granted under the license agreement shall become fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable as to us but not certain trademark royalties due to MTPC.
 Metuchen will obtain STENDRA exclusively from us for a mutually agreed term pursuant to the supply agreement. Metuchen may elect to transfer the control of the supply chain for STENDRA for the Metuchen Territory to itself or its designee by assigning to Metuchen our agreements with the contract manufacturer. For 2016 and each subsequent calendar year during the term of the supply agreement, if Metuchen fails to purchase an agreed minimum purchase amount of STENDRA from us, it will reimburse us for the shortfall as it relates to our out of pocket costs to acquire certain raw materials needed to manufacture STENDRA. Upon the termination of the supply agreement (other 

 
  23

 
than by Metuchen for our uncured material breach or upon completion of the transfer of the control of the supply chain), Metuchen’s agreed minimum purchase amount of STENDRA from us shall accelerate for the entire then current initial term or renewal term, as applicable. The initial term under the Supply Agreement will be for a period of five years, with automatic renewal for successive two year periods unless either party provides a termination notice to the other party at least two years in advance of the expiration of the then current term. On September 30, 2016, we received $70 million from Metuchen under the license agreement. Metuchen will also reimburse us for payments made to cover royalty and milestone obligations to MTPC during the term of the license agreement, but will otherwise owe us no future royalties.
 Selten Pharma, Inc.
 On January 6, 2017, we entered into a Patent Assignment Agreement with Selten, whereby we received exclusive, worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of BMPR2 activators for the treatment of PAH and related vascular diseases.  As part of the agreement, Selten assigned to us its license to a group of patents owned by Stanford, which cover uses of tacrolimus and ascomycin to treat PAH. We are responsible for future financial obligations to Stanford under that license.
 We have also assumed full responsibility for the development and commercialization of the licensed compounds for the treatment of PAH and related vascular diseases. Selten received an upfront payment of $1.0 million and is entitled to receive milestone payments based on global development status and future sales milestones, as well as tiered royalty payments on future sales of these compounds.  The total potential milestone payments are $39.0 million to Selten and $550,000 to Stanford. The majority of the milestone payments to Selten may be paid, at our sole option, either in cash or our common stock, provided that in no event shall the payment of common stock exceed fifty percent of the aggregate amount of such milestone payments.
 Other
 In October 2001, we entered into an assignment agreement, or the Assignment Agreement, with Thomas Najarian, M.D., for a combination of pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of obesity and other disorders, or the Combination Therapy, that became the focus of our development program for Qsymia. The Combination Therapy and all related patent applications, or the Patents, were transferred to us with worldwide rights to develop and commercialize the Combination Therapy and exploit the Patents. In addition, the Assignment Agreement requires us to pay royalties on worldwide net sales of a product for the treatment of obesity that is based upon the Combination Therapy and Patents until the last‑to‑expire of the assigned Patents. To the extent that we decide not to commercially exploit the Patents, the Assignment Agreement will terminate and the Combination Therapy and Patents will be assigned back to Dr. Najarian. In 2006, Dr. Najarian joined the Company as a part‑time employee and served as a Principal Scientist. In November 2013, Dr. Najarian’s employment with the Company ended, and he continues to be available as a consultant. Patents, Proprietary Technology and Data Exclusivity
 We own or are the exclusive licensee of more than 30 patents and numerous published patent applications in the U.S. and Canada. We intend to develop, maintain and secure intellectual property rights and to aggressively defend and pursue new patents to expand upon our current patent base. Our portfolio of patents, which primarily relates to Qsymia, our FDA‑approved drug for the treatment of obesity, STENDRA, our FDA‑approved drug for the treatment of ED, and tacrolimus is summarized as follows:

       *These expiration dates are based on the number of days of patent term adjustment, or PTA, calculated by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. An independent calculation of PTA suggested that the patents may be entitled to fewer days of PTA than determined by the USPTO.
 The EU has adopted a harmonized approach to data and marketing exclusivity under Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 and Directive 2001/83/EC. The exclusivity scheme applies to products that have been authorized in the EU by either the European Commission, through the centralized procedure, or the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area, or EEA, under the Decentralized or Mutual Recognition procedures. The approach (known as the 8+2+1 formula) permits eight years of data exclusivity and 10 years of marketing exclusivity. Within the first eight years of the 10 years, a generic applicant is not permitted to cross refer to the preclinical and clinical trial data relating to the reference product. Even if the generic product is authorized after expiry of the eight years of data exclusivity, it cannot be placed on the market until the full 10‑year market exclusivity has expired. This 10‑year market exclusivity may be extended cumulatively to a maximum period of 11 years if during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for a new (second) therapeutic indication which, during the scientific evaluation prior to its authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 In addition to the Canadian patents identified in the table, we also hold foreign counterparts, patents and patent applications in major foreign jurisdictions related to our U.S. patents. We have developed and acquired exclusive rights to patented technology in support of our development and commercialization of our approved drugs and investigational drug candidates, and we rely on trade secrets and proprietary technologies in developing potential drugs. We continue to 

 
  25

 
place significant emphasis on securing global intellectual property rights and are aggressively pursuing new patents to expand upon our strong foundation for commercializing investigational drug candidates in development.
 Manufacturing
 Our commercial products, Qsymia and STENDRA, together with their respective APIs and finished products, as well as our clinical supplies, are manufactured on a contract basis. In addition, packaging for the commercial distribution of the Qsymia product capsules and the STENDRA product tablets is performed by contract packaging companies. We expect to continue to contract with other third‑party providers for manufacturing services, including APIs, finished products, and packaging operations as needed. We believe that our current agreements and purchase orders with third‑party manufacturers provide for sufficient operating capacity to support the anticipated commercial demand for Qsymia and STENDRA and our clinical supplies. However, if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of Qsymia or STENDRA for our commercial sales, or the clinical supplies to support our clinical trials, or if we should encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with our manufacturers or packagers, we may lose potential sales, have difficulty entering into collaboration agreements for the commercialization of STENDRA for territories in which we do not have a commercial collaboration or our clinical trials may be delayed.
 Catalent manufactures our clinical and commercial supplies for Qsymia. Catalent has been successful in validating the commercial manufacturing process for Qsymia at a scale that has been able to support the launch of Qsymia in the U.S. market.
 On July 31, 2013, we entered into a Commercial Supply Agreement with Sanofi Chimie, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi, pursuant to which Sanofi Chimie manufactures and supplies the API for STENDRA. On November 18, 2013, we entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Sanofi Winthrop Industrie, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi, pursuant to which Sanofi Winthrop Industrie manufactures and supplies the tablets for avanafil.
 We currently do not have any manufacturing facilities and intend to continue to rely on third parties for the supply of the starting materials, API and finished dosage forms (tablets and capsules). However, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in entering into additional supplier agreements or that we will be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for any suppliers in a timely manner or at all.
 We attempt to prevent disruption of supplies through supply agreements, purchase orders, appropriate forecasting, maintaining stock levels and other strategies. In the event we are unable to manufacture our products, either directly or indirectly through others or on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, we may not be able to commercialize our products as planned. Although we are taking these actions to avoid a disruption in supply, we cannot provide assurance that we may not experience a disruption in the future.
 Marketing and Sales
 We commercialize Qsymia in the U.S. primarily through a dedicated contract sales force, supported by an internal commercial team. Our efforts to expand the appropriate use of Qsymia include scientific publications, participation and presentations at medical conferences, and development and implementation of patient-directed support programs. We have rolled out marketing programs to encourage targeted prescribers to gain more experience with Qsymia. We have increased our investment in digital media in order to amplify our messaging to information-seeking consumers. The digital messaging encourages those consumers most likely to take action to speak with their physicians about obesity treatment options. We believe our enhanced web-based strategies will deliver clear and compelling communications to potential patients. We launched the “Smart Changes Program” in which we partner Qsymia with the Mayo Clinic diet to help on-line patients make the behavioral changes needed for sustained weight-loss.
 Qsymia Distribution and REMS
 We rely on Cardinal Health 105, Inc., or Cardinal Health, a third‑party distribution and supply‑chain management company, to warehouse Qsymia and distribute it to the certified home delivery pharmacies and wholesalers that then distribute Qsymia directly to patients and certified retail pharmacies. Cardinal Health provides billing, 

 
  26

 
collection and returns services. Cardinal Health is our exclusive supplier of distribution logistics services, and accordingly we depend on Cardinal Health to satisfactorily perform its obligations under our agreement with them.
 Pursuant to the REMS program applicable to Qsymia, our distribution network is through a broader network of certified retail pharmacies and through a small number of certified home delivery pharmacies and wholesalers. We have contracted through a third‑party vendor to certify the retail pharmacies and collect required data to support the Qsymia REMS program. In addition to providing services to support the distribution and use of Qsymia, each of the certified pharmacies has agreed to comply with the REMS program requirements and, through our third‑party data collection vendor, will provide us with the necessary patient and prescribing HCP data. In addition, we have contracted with third‑party data warehouses to store this patient and HCP data and report it to us. We rely on this third‑party data in order to recognize revenue and comply with the REMS requirements for Qsymia, such as data analysis. This distribution and data collection network requires significant coordination with our sales and marketing, finance, regulatory and medical affairs teams, in light of the REMS requirements applicable to Qsymia.
 Competition
 Competition in the pharmaceutical and medical products industries is intense and is characterized by costly and extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. We are aware of several pharmaceutical companies also actively engaged in the development of therapies for the treatment of obesity, diabetes and sexual health and medical device companies engaged in the development of therapies for the treatment of sleep apnea. Many of these companies have substantially greater research and development capabilities as well as substantially greater marketing, financial and human resources than VIVUS. Our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we are currently marketing or researching and developing. Some of the drugs that may compete with Qsymia may not have a REMS requirement and the accompanying complexities such a requirement presents. Such developments could render Qsymia and STENDRA less competitive or possibly obsolete. We are also competing with respect to marketing capabilities and manufacturing efficiency, areas in which we have limited experience.
 Qsymia for the treatment of chronic weight management competes with several approved anti‑obesity drugs including, Belviq® (lorcaserin), an anti‑obesity compound being marketed by Eisai Inc., Eisai Co., Ltd.’s U.S. subsidiary; Contrave® (naltrexone/bupropion), Orexigen Therapeutics’ anti‑obesity product; Xenical® (orlistat), marketed by Roche; alli®, the over‑the‑counter version of orlistat, marketed by GlaxoSmithKline; and Novo Nordisk A/S’ Saxenda® (liraglutide) 3.0 mg.
 Agents approved for type 2 diabetes that have demonstrated weight loss in clinical studies may also compete with Qsymia. These agents include Victoza® (liraglutide; approved for diabetes at 1.2mg and 1.8mg dosage strengths) from Novo Nordisk A/S, a GLP‑1 receptor agonist approved January 25, 2010, Invokana® (canaglifozin) from Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals, an SGLT2 inhibitor, approved March 29, 2013; Farxiga™ (dapagliflozin) from AstraZeneca and Bristol‑Myers Squibb, an SGLT2 inhibitor, approved January 8, 2014; Jardiance® (empagliflozin) from Boehringer Ingelheim, an SGLT2 inhibitor, approved August 1, 2014; and Glyxambi® (empagliflozin/linagliptin) from Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly, an SGLT2 inhibitor and DPP‑4 inhibitor combination product, approved January 30, 2015. On January 14, 2015, FDA approved the Maestro Rechargeable System for certain obese adults, the first weight loss treatment device that targets the nerve pathway between the brain and the stomach that controls feelings of hunger and fullness. The Maestro Rechargeable System is approved to treat patients aged 18 and older who have not been able to lose weight with a weight loss program, and who have a body mass index of 35 to 45 with at least one other obesity‑related condition, such as type 2 diabetes.
 In addition, there are several other investigational drug candidates in Phase 2 clinical trials. Zafgen’s beloranib, currently in Phase 2 for severe obesity, is a methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) inhibitor, which is believed to work by re‑establishing balance to the ways the body packages and metabolizes fat. In January 2013, Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, or Rhythm, announced the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial with RM‑493, a small‑peptide melanocortin 4 receptor, or MC4R, agonist, for the treatment of obesity. Rhythm announced in September 2013, that RM‑493 is being studied in Phase 1B for the treatment of obesity in individuals with a genetic deficiency in the MC4R pathway. There are a number of generic pharmaceutical drugs that are prescribed for obesity, predominantly phentermine, which is sold at much lower prices than we charge for Qsymia and is also widely available in retail pharmacies. The availability of branded prescription drugs, generic drugs and over‑the‑counter drugs could limit the demand and the price we are able to charge for Qsymia.

 
  27

 

 We may also face competition from the off‑label use of the generic components in our drugs. In particular, it is possible that patients will seek to acquire phentermine and topiramate, the generic components of Qsymia. Neither of these generic components has a REMS program. Although these products have not been approved by FDA for use in the treatment of chronic obesity, the off‑label use of the generic components in the U.S. or the importation of the generic components from foreign markets could adversely affect the commercial potential for our drugs and adversely affect our overall business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Qsymia may also face challenges and competition from newly developed generic products. Under the U.S. Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch‑Waxman Act, newly approved drugs and indications may benefit from a statutory period of non‑patent marketing exclusivity. The Hatch‑Waxman Act stimulates competition by providing incentives to generic pharmaceutical manufacturers to introduce non‑infringing forms of patented pharmaceutical products and to challenge patents on branded pharmaceutical products. We have received notifications under paragraph IV of the Hatch-Waxman Act challenging certain of our Qsymia patents. If we are unsuccessful in challenging an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, filed pursuant to the Hatch‑Waxman Act, a generic version of Qsymia may be launched, which would harm our business.
 There are also surgical approaches to treat severe obesity that are becoming increasingly accepted. Two of the most well‑established surgical procedures are gastric bypass surgery and adjustable gastric banding, or lap bands. In February 2011, FDA approved the use of a lap band in patients with a BMI of 30 (reduced from 35) with comorbidities. The lowering of the BMI requirement will make more obese patients eligible for lap band surgery. In addition, other potential approaches that utilize various implantable devices or surgical tools are in development. Some of these approaches are in late‑stage development and may be approved for marketing.
 We anticipate that STENDRA for the treatment of ED will compete with PDE5 inhibitors in the form of oral medications including Viagra® (sildenafil citrate), marketed by Pfizer, Inc.; Cialis® (tadalafil), marketed by Eli Lilly and Company; Levitra® (vardenafil), co‑marketed by GlaxoSmithKline plc and Schering‑Plough Corporation in the U.S.; and STAXYN® (vardenafil in an oral disintegrating tablet, or ODT), co‑promoted by GlaxoSmithKline plc and Merck & Co., Inc.
 New developments, including the development of other drug technologies and methods of preventing the incidence of disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries at a rapid pace. These developments may render our drugs and future investigational drug candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. Compared to us, many of our potential competitors have substantially greater:

· | research and development resources, including personnel and technology;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | regulatory experience;
--+-----------------------


· | investigational drug candidate development and clinical trial experience;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | experience and expertise in exploitation of intellectual property rights; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | access to strategic partners and capital resources.
--+----------------------------------------------------

  As a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our investigational drug candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs or surgical approaches that are more effective, more useful and less costly than ours and may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products. In addition, our competitors may be more effective in commercializing their products. We currently outsource our manufacturing and therefore rely on third parties for that competitive expertise. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop or contract for these capabilities on acceptable economic terms, or at all.
 Avanafil qualifies as an innovative medicinal product in the EU. Innovative medicinal products authorized in the EU on the basis of a full marketing authorization application (as opposed to an application for marketing authorization that relies on data in the marketing authorization dossier for another, previously approved medicinal product) are entitled to eight years’ data exclusivity. During this period, applicants for approval of generics of these innovative products cannot rely on data contained in the marketing authorization dossier submitted for the innovative medicinal product. Innovative medicinal products are also entitled to 10 years’ market exclusivity. During this 10‑year period no generic medicinal product can be placed on the EU market. The 10‑year period of market exclusivity can be

extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the Marketing Authorization Holder for the innovative product obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. If we do not obtain extended patent protection and data exclusivity for our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.
 Research and Development
 We incurred $5.6 million, $10.1 million and $13.8 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, in research and development expenses, primarily to support the approval efforts, post‑marketing requirements, and clinical programs for Qsymia and STENDRA/SPEDRA. Employees
 As of February 28, 2017, we had 65 employees located at our corporate headquarters in Campbell, California and in the field. None of our current employees are represented by a labor union or are the subject of a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good, and we have never experienced a work stoppage at any of our facilities. Insurance
 We maintain product liability insurance for our clinical trials and commercial sales and general liability and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for our operations. Insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. Although we have obtained product liability insurance coverage, we may be unable to maintain this product liability coverage for our approved drugs in amounts or scope sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against all potential risks.
