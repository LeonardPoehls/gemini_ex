Item 1. Business
General Overview
Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc. is a Houston-based energy company which, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, “Carrizo,” the “Company” or “we”), is actively engaged in the exploration, development, and production of oil and gas primarily from resource plays located in the United States. Our current operations are principally focused in proven, producing oil and gas plays primarily in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, the Delaware Basin in West Texas, the Niobrara Formation in Colorado, the Utica Shale in Ohio, and the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania.
Crude oil production in 2016 was 25,745 Bbls/d, an increase of 12% as compared to 23,054 Bbls/d in 2015, primarily driven by strong performance from our wells in the Eagle Ford. We achieved this despite an 18% decrease in drilling and completion capital expenditures in 2016 as compared to 2015. Total production in 2016 increased to 42,276 Boe/d from 36,719 Boe/d in 2015 primarily due to production from our wells in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin. 
At year-end 2016, our proved reserves of 200.2 MMBoe were 64% crude oil, 12% natural gas liquids and 24% natural gas. Our reserves increased 29.6 MMBoe from our year-end 2015 proved reserves of 170.6 MMBoe primarily as a result of our ongoing drilling program in the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin and the Sanchez Acquisition described below. The following is a summary of the Company’s proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. See “—Additional Oil and Gas Disclosures—Proved Oil and Gas Reserves” for further details of our proved reserves.

 | Proved Reserves 
 | December 31, 2016 | December 31, 2015
Region | (MMBoe) 
Eagle Ford | 162.3 | | 144.0
Delaware Basin | 11.7 | | 1.0 
Niobrara | 2.7 | | 3.9 
Marcellus | 21.8 | | 19.8 
Utica and other | 1.7 | | 1.9 
Total | 200.2 | | 170.6

Our 2017 capital expenditure plan currently includes $530.0 million to $550.0 million for drilling and completion and $20.0 million for leasehold and seismic. This plan incorporates an assumed increase in oilfield service costs during the year and should allow the Company to run three rigs in the Eagle Ford during the year as well as continue to develop its acreage in the Delaware Basin. We intend to finance our 2017 capital expenditure plan primarily from cash flow from operations and our senior secured revolving credit facility as well as other sources described in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Our capital expenditure plan has the flexibility to adjust, should the commodity price environment change. The following is a summary of our actual capital expenditures for 2016 and our planned capital expenditures for 2017:

 | Capital Expenditures
 | 2017 Plan | | 2016 Actual
 | (In millions) 
Drilling and completion | | | 
Eagle Ford | | $485.0 | | | $334.5
Delaware Basin | 40.0 | | | 47.2 
All other regions | 15.0 | | | 24.2 
Total drilling and completion (1) | 540.0 | | | 405.9
Leasehold and seismic (2) | 20.0 | | | 26.4 
Total (3) | | $560.0 | | | $432.3


(1) | Represents the midpoint of our 2017 drilling and completion capital expenditure plan of $530.0 million to $550.0 million.


(2) | Our 2016 actual leasehold and seismic capital expenditures and our 2017 leasehold and seismic capital expenditure plan exclude amounts related to the Sanchez Acquisition described below.


(3) | Our capital expenditure plan and the capital expenditures included above exclude capitalized general and administrative expense, capitalized interest and capitalized asset retirement obligations.

Business Strategy
Our objective is to increase value through the execution of a business strategy focused on growth through the drill-bit complimented by opportunistic acquisitions of oil and gas properties, while maintaining a sound financial position. Key elements of our business strategy include:

• | Utilize our experience as a technical advantage. We believe we have developed a technical advantage from our extensive experience drilling nearly 900 horizontal wells in various resource plays, including the Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin, Utica, Niobrara, Marcellus, and previously, the Barnett, which has allowed our management, technical staff and field operations teams to gain significant experience in resource plays and create highly efficient drilling and completion operations. We now leverage this advantage in our existing, as well as any prospective, shale trends. We plan to focus substantially all of our 2017 capital expenditures in the Eagle Ford and, to a lesser extent, the Delaware Basin.


• | Pursue opportunities to expand core positions. We pursue a growth strategy in crude oil plays primarily driven by the attractive relative economics associated with our core positions. Nearly 100% of our 2017 drilling and completion capital expenditure plan is directed towards opportunities that we believe are predominantly prospective for crude oil development. We continue to focus our capital program on resource plays where individual wells tend to have lower risk, such as our operations in the Eagle Ford and, more recently, the Delaware Basin. Additionally, we continue to take advantage of opportunities to expand our core positions through leasehold acquisitions as evidenced by the Sanchez Acquisition described below.


• | Control operating and capital costs. We emphasize efficiencies to lower our costs to find, develop and produce our oil and gas reserves. This includes concentrating on our core areas, which allows us to optimize drilling and completion techniques as well as benefit from economies of scale. In addition, as we operate a significant percentage of our properties as well as maintain a minimal level of drilling commitments in order to hold acreage, the majority of our capital expenditure plan is discretionary, allowing us the ability to reallocate or adjust the level of our spending in response to changes in market conditions. For example, after a substantial reduction in our 2016 capital expenditure plan, we have moderately increased our 2017 capital expenditure plan, in response to a more optimistic outlook in commodity prices.


• | Maintain our financial flexibility. We are committed to preserving our financial flexibility. We have historically funded our capital program with a combination of cash generated from operations, proceeds from the sale of assets, proceeds from sales of securities, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and proceeds, payments or carried interest from our joint ventures.


• | Manage risk exposure. We seek to limit our financial risks, in part by seeking well-funded partners to ensure that we are able to move forward on projects in a timely manner. We also attempt to limit our exposure to volatility in commodity prices by actively hedging production of crude oil. Our current long-term strategy is to manage exposure to commodity price volatility for a portion of our forecasted crude oil and natural gas production to achieve a more predictable level of cash flows to support current and future capital expenditure plans.

Our Competitive Strengths
We believe we have the following competitive strengths that will support our efforts to successfully execute our business strategy:

• | Large inventory of oil-focused drilling locations. We have developed a significant inventory of future oil-focused drilling locations, primarily in our well-established positions in the Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin, Niobrara, and Utica. As of December 31, 2016, we owned leases covering approximately 309,200 gross (179,179 net) acres in these areas. See “—Acreage Data” for further details. Approximately 54% of our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were undeveloped.


• | Operational control. As of December 31, 2016, we operated approximately 94% of the wells in Eagle Ford in which we held an interest. We held an average working interest of approximately 85% in these operated wells. Our significant operational control, as well as our manageable leasehold obligations, provides us with the flexibility to align capital expenditures with cash flow and control our costs as we transition to an advanced development mode in key plays. As a further result of our operational control, we are generally able to adjust drilling plans in response to changes in commodity prices.


• | Successful drilling history. We follow a disciplined approach to drilling wells by applying proven horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technology. Additionally, we rely on advanced technologies, such as 3-D seismic and micro-seismic analysis, to better define geologic risk and enhance the results of our drilling efforts. Our successful drilling program has significantly de-risked our acreage positions in key resource plays.

• | Experienced management and professional workforce. Our management has transitioned our focus to oil by entering new plays and completed non-core asset sales. We have an experienced staff, both employees and contractors, of oil and gas professionals, including geophysicists, petrophysicists, geologists, petroleum engineers, production and reservoir engineers and technical support staff. We believe our experience and expertise, particularly as they relate to successfully identifying and developing resource plays, is a competitive advantage.


• | Financial flexibility. We maintain a financial profile that provides operational flexibility, and our capital structure provides us with the ability to execute our business plan. Our financial profile is designed to allow us to withstand prolonged periods of low commodity prices, but also provides the ability to accelerate activity as commodity prices recover. As of February 24, 2017, we had $91.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility, have no near-term debt maturities, and use commodity derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility for a portion of our forecasted crude oil and natural gas production. We believe that we have the ability and financial flexibility to fund the planned development of our assets. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further details.

Exploration and Operation Approach
Our exploration strategy in our shale resource plays has been to accumulate significant leasehold positions in areas with known shale thickness and thermal maturity in the proximity of known or emerging pipeline infrastructures. A component of our exploration strategy is to first identify and acquire surface tracts or “well pads” from which multiple wells can be drilled. We then seek to acquire contiguous lease blocks in the areas immediately adjacent to these well pads that can be developed quickly. If conditions warrant, we next acquire 3-D seismic data over these leases to assist in well placement and development optimization. Finally, we form drilling units and utilize sophisticated horizontal drilling, multi-stage simultaneous hydraulic fracturing programs and micro-seismic techniques designed to maximize the production rate and recoverable reserves from a unit area. 
We strive to achieve a balance between acquiring acreage, seismic data (2-D and 3-D) and timely project evaluation through the drillbit to ensure that we minimize the costs to test for commercial reserves while building a significant acreage position. Our first exploration wells in these trends are a limited number of horizontal wells, because they allow us to evaluate thermal maturity and rock property data, while also permitting us to test various completion techniques without incurring the cost of drilling a substantial number of horizontal wells. As discussed above, our primary focus is on crude oil to take advantage of what we believe are the attractive relative economics associated with this commodity.
We maintain a flexible and diversified approach to project identification by focusing on the estimated financial results of a project area rather than limiting our focus to any one method or source for obtaining leads for new project areas. Additionally, we monitor competitor activity and review outside prospect generation by small, independent “prospect generators.” We complement our exploratory drilling portfolio through the use of these outside sources of prospect generation and typically retain operator rights. Specific drill-sites are typically chosen by our own geoscientists or, in environmentally sensitive areas, are dictated by available leases.
Our management team has extensive experience in the development and management of exploration and development projects. We believe that the experience we have gained drilling and completing horizontal wells in multiple basins and the experience of our management team in the development, processing and analysis of 3-D projects and data, will play a significant part in our future success.
We generally seek to obtain operator rights and control over field operations, and in particular seek to control decisions regarding 3-D survey design parameters and drilling and completion methods. As of December 31, 2016, we operated 667 gross (473.7 net) productive oil and gas wells. We generally seek to control operations for most new exploration and development, taking advantage of our technical staff’s experience in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. For example, during 2016, we operated 100% of the wells drilled in the Eagle Ford where we incurred approximately 82% of our 2016 drilling and completion capital expenditures.
Working Interest and Drilling in Project Areas
The actual working interest we will ultimately own in a well will vary based upon several factors, including the risk of each well relative to our strategic goals, activity levels and capital availability. From time to time some fraction of these wells may be sold to industry partners either on a prospect by prospect basis or a program basis. In addition, we may also contribute acreage to larger drilling units thereby reducing prospect working interest. We have, in the past, retained less than 100% working interest in our drilling prospects. References to our interests are not intended to imply that we have or will maintain any particular level of working interest.

Regional Overview
Eagle Ford Shale
The Eagle Ford is our most significant operational area. Our core Eagle Ford properties are located in LaSalle County and, to a lesser extent, in McMullen, Frio and Atascosa counties in Texas. On December 14, 2016, we completed the acquisition of producing wells and acreage primarily in LaSalle, Frio and McMullen counties from Sanchez Energy Corporation and SN Cotulla Assets, LLC, a subsidiary of Sanchez Energy Corporation (“Sanchez Acquisition”) for a purchase price of $181.0 million, subject to purchase price adjustments. The acquisition had an effective date of June 1, 2016. We paid $10.0 million as a deposit on October 24, 2016 and $143.5 million at the initial closing on December 14, 2016, which included purchase price adjustments primarily related to net cash flows from the acquired wells from the effective date to the closing date of $10.7 million and adjustments of $16.8 million for leases not conveyed to us at the initial closing. The acquisition added more than 70 net de-risked drilling locations based on our current development spacing assumptions, which include only a single layer of development within the Lower Eagle Ford Shale, but has upside potential from development of additional zones. 
As of December 31, 2016, we held interests in approximately 130,114 gross (100,195 net) acres and were operating two rigs in the Eagle Ford. We currently plan for approximately 90% of our 2017 drilling and completion capital expenditure plan to be directed towards opportunities in the Eagle Ford. During 2016, we began to test various completion optimization techniques, such as tighter frac stage spacing, reducing the stage spacing from 240 ft. to 200 ft. We have been pleased with the early results of this testing and plan to test even tighter frac stage spacing in future Eagle Ford wells. 
GAIL Joint Venture. In September 2011, we entered into joint venture arrangements with GAIL GLOBAL (USA) INC. (“GAIL”), a wholly owned subsidiary of GAIL (India) Limited. Under this arrangement, GAIL acquired a 20% interest in certain oil and gas properties in the Eagle Ford and an option to purchase a 20% share of acreage acquired by us after the closing located in specified areas adjacent to the initially purchased areas. We generally serve as operator of the GAIL joint venture properties. As of December 31, 2016, acres included in the GAIL joint venture cover approximately 25% of our total Eagle Ford acreage.

Delaware Basin
During 2014, we began to build an acreage position in the Delaware Basin in Culberson and Reeves counties, Texas, targeting the Wolfcamp Formation. As of December 31, 2016, we held interests in approximately 46,157 gross (21,728 net) acres in the Delaware Basin. During 2016, we drilled 4 gross (4.0 net) wells and completed 4 gross (3.9 net) wells. As we have refined our completion techniques, we have seen improved results. The most recent well brought online was the Fortress State 1H, which achieved a peak 30-day rate of 1,520 Boe/d on a restricted choke. We continue to like the potential of the play and look to expand our acreage over time.
Niobrara Formation
As of December 31, 2016, we held interests in approximately 97,314 gross (31,355 net) acres in the Niobrara, primarily in Weld and Adams counties, Colorado, and were not operating any rigs. During 2016, we did not drill any wells as operator, but completed 9 gross (5.2 net) wells and participated in 22 gross (1.6 net) non-operated wells. We currently expect to continue to participate as a non-operator in high-density projects in the Niobrara, but have no current plans to drill any operated wells in Niobrara in 2017. As a result, we have limited capital allocated to Niobrara as part of our 2017 drilling and completion capital expenditure plan. However, given the improving economics in the play, we will continue to evaluate whether to reallocate a portion of the 2017 drilling and completion capital expenditure plan for further operated development in the latter half of the year. 
OIL JV Partners Joint Venture. In October 2012, we completed the sale of a portion of our interests in certain oil and gas properties in the Niobrara to OIL India (USA) Inc. and IOCL (USA) Inc., wholly owned subsidiaries of OIL India Ltd. and Indian Oil Corporation Ltd., respectively. For convenience, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K the term “OIL JV Partners” is used to refer collectively to OIL India (USA) Inc. and IOCL (USA) Inc. We also granted an option in favor of the OIL JV Partners to purchase a 30% share of acreage subsequently acquired by us in specified areas of the play.
Haimo Joint Venture. In December 2012, we completed the sale of an additional portion of our remaining interests in the same oil and gas properties sold to the OIL JV Partners in the transaction described above to Haimo Oil & Gas LLC (“Haimo”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Lanzhou Haimo Technologies Co. Ltd. We also granted an option in favor of Haimo to purchase a 10% share of acreage subsequently acquired by us in the same properties as the OIL JV Partners described above. Following the closing of the Haimo transaction in fourth quarter 2012, the joint venture ownership interests in our Niobrara development activities were 60% Carrizo, 30% OIL JV Partners, and 10% Haimo. 
We serve as operator of a significant percentage of the properties covered by our Niobrara joint venture arrangements. 
Marcellus Shale
As of December 31, 2016, we held interests in approximately 36,293 gross (12,425 net) acres in the Marcellus. We will continue to monitor prices and, consistent with our existing contractual commitments, may increase our activity level and capital expenditures, if natural gas prices so warrant. Our activities in the Marcellus are currently conducted through two joint ventures described below. As of December 31, 2016, we were not operating any rigs in the Marcellus. 
Reliance Joint Venture. In September 2010, we completed the sale of 20% of our interests in substantially all of our oil and gas properties in Pennsylvania that had been subject to the Avista Marcellus joint venture described in “Avista Marcellus Joint Venture” below to Reliance Marcellus II, LLC (“Reliance”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Holding USA, Inc. and an affiliate of Reliance Industries Limited. As described in “Avista Marcellus Joint Venture” below, simultaneously with the closing of our transaction with Reliance, ACP II Marcellus LLC (“ACP II”) closed the sale of its entire interest in the same properties to Reliance. In connection with these sale transactions, we and Reliance also entered into agreements to form a new joint venture with respect to the interests purchased by Reliance from us and ACP II. The joint venture properties are generally held 60% by Reliance and 40% by us. 
We have agreed to various restrictions on our ability to transfer our properties covered by the Reliance joint venture. Additionally, we are subject to a mutual right of first offer on direct and indirect property transfers for the remainder of a ten-year development period (through September 2020), subject to specified exceptions. We generally serve as operator of the properties covered by the Reliance joint venture, with Reliance having the right to assume operatorship of 60% of undeveloped acreage in portions of central Pennsylvania. 
Avista Marcellus Joint Venture. Effective August 2008, our wholly owned subsidiary Carrizo (Marcellus) LLC entered into a joint venture arrangement with ACP II, an affiliate of Avista Capital Partners, LP, a private equity fund (collectively with ACP II and ACP III Utica LLC (“ACP III”), our joint venture partner in the Utica, “Avista”). In September 2010, we completed the sale of 20% of our interests in substantially all of our oil and gas properties in Pennsylvania that had been subject to the Avista Marcellus joint venture to Reliance as described above under “Reliance Joint Venture.” Simultaneously with the closing of this transaction, ACP II closed the sale of its entire interest in the same properties to Reliance. In connection with these sales transactions, we and

Avista amended the participation agreement and other joint venture agreements with Avista to provide that the properties that we and Avista sold to Reliance, as well as the properties we committed to the new joint venture with Reliance, were no longer subject to the terms of the Avista Marcellus joint venture, and that the Avista Marcellus joint venture’s area of mutual interest would generally not include Pennsylvania, the state in which those properties were located. Our Marcellus joint venture with Avista continues and covers acreage primarily in West Virginia and New York. Pursuant to the terms of the amended participation agreement, the areas of mutual interest with Avista have been reduced to specified halos around existing properties in New York and West Virginia. We conducted no material activity under this joint venture during 2016 and do not currently expect to conduct any activity in 2017. For further discussion, see “Note 10. Related Party Transactions” of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Utica Shale
As of December 31, 2016, we held interests in approximately 35,615 gross (25,901 net) acres in the Utica. During 2016, we did not drill or complete any operated wells, but have 16 additional operated wells in inventory where we have drilled and cased the upper portions of such wells. As of December 31, 2016, we were not operating any rigs in the Utica. 
Avista Utica Joint Venture. Effective September 2011, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Carrizo (Utica) LLC, entered into a joint venture in the Utica with ACP II, and ACP III. During the term of the Avista Utica joint venture, the joint venture partners acquired and sold acreage and we exercised options under the Avista Utica joint venture agreements to acquire acreage from Avista. The Avista Utica joint venture agreements were terminated on October 31, 2013 in connection with our purchase of certain ACP III assets. After giving effect to this transaction, we and Avista remain working interest partners and we will operate the jointly owned properties which are now subject to standard joint operating agreements. The joint operating agreements with Avista provide for limited areas of mutual interest around our remaining jointly owned acreage. 
Steven A. Webster, Chairman of our Board of Directors, serves as Co-Managing Partner and President of Avista Capital Holdings, LP, which has the ability to control Avista and its affiliates. ACP II’s and ACP III’s Boards of Managers have the sole authority for determining whether, when and to what extent any cash distributions will be declared and paid to members of ACP II or ACP III, respectively. Mr. Webster is not a member of either entity’s Board of Managers. As previously disclosed, we have been a party to prior arrangements with affiliates of Avista Capital Holdings LP, including our existing joint venture with Avista in the Marcellus. The terms of the joint ventures with Avista in the Utica and the Marcellus and the related transactions that took place were each separately approved by a special committee of the Company’s independent, non-employee directors. See also “Note 10. Related Party Transactions” of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Additional Oil and Gas Disclosures
Proved Oil and Gas Reserves 
The following table sets forth our estimated net proved reserves and PV-10 as of December 31, 2016 that were prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (“Ryder Scott”), our independent third party reserve engineers. For further information concerning Ryder Scott’s estimates of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2016, see the reserve report included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
The prices used in the calculation of our estimated proved reserves and PV-10 as of December 31, 2016 were based on the average realized prices for sales of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas on the first calendar day of each month during the 12-month period prior to December 31, 2016 (“12-Month Average Realized Price”) in accordance with SEC rules and were $39.60 per Bbl of crude oil, $11.66 per Bbl of natural gas liquids and $1.89 per Mcf of natural gas. 
For further information concerning the present value of estimated future net revenues from these proved reserves, see “Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and “Note 15. Supplemental Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited)” of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. See also “—Other Reserve Matters” below for further discussion.

Reconciliation of Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows (GAAP) to PV-10 (Non-GAAP)
We believe that the presentation of PV-10 provides greater comparability when evaluating oil and gas companies due to the many factors unique to each individual company that impact the amount and timing of future income taxes. In addition, we believe that PV-10 is widely used by investors and analysts as a basis for comparing the relative size and value of our proved reserves to other oil and gas companies. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows or any other measure of a company's financial or operating performance presented in accordance with GAAP. The definition of PV-10 as defined in “Item 1. Business—Glossary of Certain Industry Terms” may differ significantly from the definitions used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, PV-10 as defined may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. A reconciliation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows to PV-10 is presented below. Neither PV-10 nor the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows purport to represent the fair value of our proved oil and gas reserves.

 | As of December 31, 2016
 | (In millions) 
Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows (GAAP) | | $1,303.4
Add: present value of future income taxes discounted at 10% per annum (1) | — | 
PV-10 (Non-GAAP) | | $1,303.4


(1) | Future income taxes in the calculation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows were zero as of December 31, 2016, as the historical tax basis of proved oil and gas properties, net operating loss carryforwards, and future tax deductions exceeded the undiscounted future net cash flows before income taxes of our proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2016.

Extensions and discoveries of 52.0 MMBoe were due to additional offset locations associated with our drilling program, of which 43.8 MMBoe were in the Eagle Ford. We incurred $48.3 million during 2016 for certain of these PUD locations that were drilled but uncompleted as of December 31, 2016. 
Revisions of previous estimates included negative revisions of 4.3 MMBoe due to price, primarily due to the decline in the 12-Month Average Realized Price for crude oil from $47.24 per barrel as of December 31, 2015 to $39.60 per barrel as of December 31, 2016, of which 2.4 MMBoe related to PUD locations that were no longer economic and 1.9 MMBoe related to reductions in the level of economic reserves of PUD locations due to loss of tail reserves. Revisions of previous estimates also included negative revisions due to performance of 7.9 MMBoe primarily as a result of tighter spacing and shorter lateral lengths on certain PUD locations in the Eagle Ford, both of which reduced the estimated ultimate recovery for certain PUD locations.
We removed 6.9 MMBoe of PUDs in the Eagle Ford due to changes in our previously approved development plan which resulted in the timing of development for certain PUD locations to move beyond five years from initial booking. The drivers of the changes in our previously approved development plan were the move to a more efficient development plan which includes drilling and completing larger pads and the recent Sanchez Acquisition.
We converted 20.1 MMBoe of PUD reserves to proved developed during 2016, of which 19.6 MMBoe were in the Eagle Ford, at a total cost of $277.5 million, or $13.81 per Boe. We also incurred $12.2 million during 2016 on PUD locations that were drilled but uncompleted as of December 31, 2016 that were booked as PUDs as of December 31, 2015. 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 17.7 MMBoe of PUD reserves associated with wells that were drilled but uncompleted, of which 16.1 MMBoe are attributable to wells drilled during 2016 and scheduled to be completed in the first half of 2017. The remaining 1.6 MMBoe are attributable to wells scheduled to be completed within five years of their initial booking. We expect to incur $129.5 million of capital expenditures to complete these wells. 
11

At December 31, 2016, we did not have any reserves that have remained undeveloped for five or more years since the date of their initial booking and all PUD locations are scheduled to be developed within five years of their initial booking. 
Qualifications of Technical Persons 
In accordance with the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and the guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), Ryder Scott estimated 100% of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 as presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The technical persons responsible for preparing the reserves estimates meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Ryder Scott does not own an interest in our properties and is not employed on a contingent fee basis.
Our internal reserve engineers each have over 25 years of experience in the petroleum industry and extensive experience in the estimation of reserves and the review of reserve reports prepared by third party engineering firms. The reserve reports are also reviewed by senior management, including the Chief Executive Officer, who is a registered petroleum engineer and holds a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and the Chief Operating Officer, who holds a B.S. in Petroleum Engineering.
Internal Controls Over Reserve Estimation Process
The primary inputs to the reserve estimation process are comprised of technical information, financial data, production data, and ownership interests. All field and reservoir technical information, which is updated annually, is assessed for validity when the internal reserve engineers hold technical meetings with our geoscientists, operations, and land personnel to discuss field performance and to validate future development plans. The other inputs used in the reserve estimation process, including, but not limited to, future capital expenditures, commodity price differentials, production costs, and ownership percentages are subject to internal controls over financial reporting and are assessed for effectiveness annually. 
Our internal reserve engineers work closely with Ryder Scott to ensure the integrity, accuracy, and timeliness of the data furnished to Ryder Scott for use in their reserves estimation process. Our internal reserve engineers meet regularly with Ryder Scott to review and discuss methods and assumptions used in Ryder Scott’s preparation of the year-end reserves estimates. The internal reserve engineers review the inputs and assumptions made in the reserves estimates prepared by Ryder Scott and assess them for reasonableness.
Specific internal control procedures include, but are not limited to, the following:

• | Review by our internal reserve engineers of all of our reported proved reserves at the close of each quarter, including review of all additions to PUD reserves


• | Quarterly updates by our senior management to our Board of Directors regarding operational data, including production, drilling and completion activity and any significant changes in our reserves estimates


• | Quarterly and annual preparation of a reserve reconciliation that is reviewed by members of our senior management


• | Annual review by our senior management of our year-end reserves estimates prepared by Ryder Scott


• | Annual review by our senior management and Board of Directors of our multi-year development plan and approval by the Board of Directors of our capital expenditure plan


• | Review by our senior management of changes, if applicable, in our previously approved development plan

Other Reserve Matters
No estimates of proved reserves comparable to those included herein have been included in reports to any federal agency other than the SEC. The reserves data set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K represents only estimates. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our reserve data and estimated discounted future net cash flows are estimates based on assumptions that may be inaccurate and are based on existing economic and operating conditions that may change in the future.” 
Our future oil and gas production is highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—We depend on successful exploration, development and acquisitions to maintain reserves and revenue in the future.” Also, the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations, or such operator’s breach of the applicable agreements, could adversely impact us. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—We cannot control the activities on properties we do not operate.”
 The prices used in calculating the estimated future net revenue attributable to proved reserves do not necessarily reflect market prices for oil and gas production. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our reserve data and estimated discounted future net cash flows are estimates based on assumptions that may be inaccurate and are based on existing economic and operating conditions 
12

that may change in the future.” There can be no assurance that all of the proved reserves will be produced and sold within the periods indicated, that the assumed prices will actually be realized for such production or that existing contracts will be honored or judicially enforced.

Productive Wells
The following table sets forth the number of productive crude oil and natural gas wells in which we owned an interest as of December 31, 2016.

 | CompanyOperated | Non-Operated | | Total
 | Gross | Net | | Gross | Net | Gross | | Net
Crude oil | 573 | | 437.1 | | 270 | | 20.4 | | 843 | 457.5

Acreage Data
The following table sets forth certain information regarding our developed and undeveloped acreage as of December 31, 2016. Developed acreage refers to acreage on which wells have been completed to a point that would permit production of oil and gas in commercial quantities. Undeveloped acreage refers to acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit production of oil and gas in commercial quantities whether or not the acreage contains proved reserves.

 | Developed Acreage | Undeveloped Acreage | | Total Acreage | Percent of Net Undeveloped Acreage Expiring
 | Gross | Net | | Gross | Net | Gross | | Net | 2017 | 2018 | | 2019
Eagle Ford | 93,584 | | 76,026 | | 36,530 | | 24,169 | | 130,114 | | 100,195 | | 42 | % | (1) | 8 | % | (2) | 12 | % | (2)
Delaware Basin | 8,087 | | 5,799 | | 38,070 | | 15,929 | | 46,157 | | 21,728 | | 83 | % | (3) | 5 | % | | 10 | % |

(1) | Of the approximate 10,150 net undeveloped acres scheduled to expire in 2017 in Eagle Ford, approximately 9,150 net undeveloped acres will be held due to development activity or extended by lease extension payments. The remaining net undeveloped acres which are scheduled to expire do not have any associated proved undeveloped reserves.


(2) | Proved undeveloped reserves associated with the net undeveloped acres scheduled to expire in 2018 and 2019 are scheduled to be developed prior to the acreage expiration.


(3) | In January 2017, we paid to extend approximately 4,000 net undeveloped acres in the Delaware Basin that were scheduled to expire in 2017 and plan on extending the remaining net undeveloped acres scheduled to expire in 2017 either through development activity or lease extension payments.


(4) | Other includes non-core acreage principally located in Texas, Colorado, Wyoming, West Virginia, Kentucky, Illinois and New York, where the Company does not currently have planned capital expenditures. There are no costs for unproved property or proved undeveloped reserves associated with the non-core net undeveloped acreage.

Our lease agreements generally terminate if producing wells have not been drilled on the acreage within their primary term or an extension thereof (a period that can be from three to ten years depending on the area). The percentage of net undeveloped acreage expiring in 2017, 2018, and 2019 assumes that no producing wells have been drilled on acreage within their primary term or have been extended. We manage our lease expirations to ensure that we do not experience unintended material expirations. Our leasehold management efforts include scheduling drilling in order to hold leases by production or timely exercising our contractual rights to extend the terms of leases by continuous operations or the payment of lease extension payments and delay rentals. We may choose to allow some leases to expire that are no longer part of our development plans.
The proved undeveloped reserves associated with acreage expiring over the next three years are not material to the Company.

Marketing
Typically, our oil and gas is sold at the wellhead to unaffiliated third party purchasers. Crude oil is sold at prices based on posted prices or NYMEX plus or minus market differentials for the respective area. Natural gas and NGLs are sold under contract at a negotiated price which is based on the market price for the area or at published prices for specified locations or pipelines (such as Houston Ship Channel, Dominion Transmission, Texas Eastern Zone M-2, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Zone 4-300, and Transco Leidy Hub) and then discounted by the purchaser back to the wellhead based upon a number of factors normally considered in the industry (such as distance from the well to the central market location, well pressure, quality of natural gas and prevailing supply and demand conditions). We have made the strategic decision to sell as much of our natural gas production at the wellhead as possible, so that we can concentrate our efforts and resources on exploration and production which we believe are more consistent with our competitive expertise, rather than natural gas gathering, processing, transportation and marketing. In each case, we sell at competitive market prices based on a differential to several market locations. In instances of depressed oil and gas prices, we may elect to shut-in wells until commodity prices are more favorable. We do not believe the loss of any one of our purchasers would materially affect our ability to sell the oil and gas we produce because we believe other purchasers are available in all our areas of operations.
Our marketing objective is to receive competitive wellhead prices for our product. There are a variety of factors that affect the market for oil and gas generally, including:

• | demand for oil and gas;


• | the extent of supply of oil and gas and, in particular, domestic production and imports;


• | the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities;


• | the marketing of competitive fuels; and


• | the effects of state and federal regulations on oil and gas production and sales.

See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Oil and gas prices are highly volatile, and continued low oil and gas prices or further price decreases will negatively affect our financial position, planned capital expenditures and results of operations,” “—We are subject to various environmental risks and governmental regulations, including those relating to benzene emissions, hydraulic fracturing and global climate change, and future regulations may be more stringent resulting in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and gas that we produce,” and “—If our access to markets is restricted, it could negatively impact our production, our income and ultimately our ability to retain our leases. Our ability to sell oil and natural gas and receive market prices for our oil and natural gas may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints.”
In addition to selling our oil and gas at the wellhead, we work with various pipeline companies to procure and to assure capacity for our natural gas. For further discussion of this matter, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—If our access to markets is restricted, it could negatively impact our production, our income and ultimately our ability to retain our leases. Our ability to sell oil and natural gas and receive market prices for our oil and natural gas may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints.” We have entered into various long-term gathering, processing, and transportation contracts with various parties which require us to deliver fixed, determinable quantities of production over specified periods of time. Certain of these contracts require us to make payments for any shortfalls in delivering or transporting minimum volumes under these commitments. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual Obligations” and “Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies” for additional details regarding our financial commitments under these contracts.
Competition and Technological Changes
We encounter competition from other oil and gas companies in all areas of our operations, including the acquisition of exploratory prospects and proven properties. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies that have been engaged in the oil and gas business for much longer than we have and possess substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than we do. We may not be able to conduct our operations, evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions successfully in this highly competitive environment.
The oil and gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete or if we are unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
Regulation
Oil and gas operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international environmental regulations that may change from time to time, including regulations governing oil and gas production and transportation, federal and state regulations governing 
15

environmental quality and pollution control and state limits on allowable rates of production by well or proration unit. These regulations may affect the amount of oil and gas available for sale, the availability of adequate pipeline and other regulated processing and transportation facilities and the marketing of competitive fuels. For example, a productive natural gas well may be “shut-in” because of an oversupply of natural gas or lack of an available natural gas pipeline in the areas in which we may conduct operations. State and federal regulations generally are intended to prevent waste of oil and gas, protect rights to produce oil and gas between owners in a common reservoir, control the amount of oil and gas produced by assigning allowable rates of production, provide nondiscriminatory access to common carrier pipelines and control contamination of the environment. Pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of various federal, state and local agencies. We are also subject to changing and extensive tax laws, the effects of which cannot be predicted.
The following discussion summarizes the regulation of the United States oil and gas industry. We believe we are in substantial compliance with the various statutes, rules, regulations and governmental orders to which our operations may be subject, although we cannot assure you that this is or will remain the case. Moreover, those statutes, rules, regulations and government orders may be changed or reinterpreted from time to time in response to economic or political conditions, and any such changes or reinterpretations could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The following discussion is not intended to constitute a complete discussion of the various statutes, rules, regulations and governmental orders to which our operations may be subject.
Regulation of Natural Gas and Oil Exploration and Production
Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels that:

• | require permits for the drilling of wells;


• | mandate that we maintain bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells; and


• | regulate the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, groundwater sampling requirements prior to drilling, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the disposal of fluids used in connection with operations.

Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These regulations govern the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, setback rules, the density of wells that may be drilled in oil and gas properties and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In this regard, some states (including Colorado and Ohio) allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states (including Texas) rely primarily or exclusively on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In areas where pooling is primarily or exclusively voluntary, it may be more difficult to form units and therefore more difficult to develop a project if the operator owns less than 100% of the leasehold. In addition, state conservation laws that establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose specified requirements regarding the ratability of production. The effect of these regulations may limit the amount of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our costs of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability. Because these laws and regulations are frequently expanded, amended and reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such regulations.
Regulation of Sales and Transportation of Natural Gas
Federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed. Under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulates the interstate transportation and the sale in interstate commerce for resale of natural gas. Effective January 1, 1993, the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act (the “Decontrol Act”) deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas, including all of our sales of our own production. As a result, all of our domestically produced natural gas is sold at market prices, subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect. The FERC’s jurisdiction over interstate natural gas transportation, however, was not affected by the Decontrol Act.
Under the NGA, facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas are exempt from the FERC’s jurisdiction. We own certain natural gas pipelines that we believe satisfy the FERC’s criteria for establishing that these are all gathering facilities not subject to FERC jurisdiction under the NGA. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental, and in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. Some of the delay in bringing our natural gas to market has been the lack of available pipeline systems in the Marcellus and Utica, particularly those that would take natural gas production from the lease to existing infrastructure. In order to partly alleviate this issue, in the past, certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries have constructed non-jurisdictional gathering facilities in cases where we have determined that we can construct those facilities more quickly or more efficiently than waiting on an unrelated third-party pipeline company.
16

One of our pipeline subsidiaries, Hondo Pipeline Inc., may exercise the power of eminent domain and is a regulated public utility within the meaning of Section 101.003 (“GURA”) and Section 121.001 (the “Cox Act”) of the Texas Utilities Code. Both GURA and the Cox Act prohibit unreasonable discrimination in the transportation of natural gas and authorize the Texas Railroad Commission to regulate gas transportation rates. However, GURA provides for negotiated rates with transportation, industrial or similar large-volume contract customers so long as neither party has an unfair negotiating advantage, the negotiated rate is substantially the same as that negotiated with at least two other customers under similar conditions, or sufficient competition existed when the rate was negotiated.
Although we do not own or operate any pipelines or facilities that are directly regulated by the FERC, its regulations of third-party pipelines and facilities could indirectly affect our ability to market our production. Beginning in the 1980s, the FERC initiated a series of major restructuring orders that required pipelines, among other things, to perform open access transportation, “unbundle” their sales and transportation functions, and allow shippers to release their pipeline capacity to other shippers. As a result of these changes, sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties. We believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while, at the same time, substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace. It remains to be seen, however, what effect the FERC’s other activities will have on access to markets, the fostering of competition and the cost of doing business. We cannot predict what new or different regulations the FERC and other regulatory agencies may adopt, or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities.
In the past, Congress has been very active in the area of natural gas regulation. However, the more recent trend has been in favor of deregulation or “lighter handed” regulation and the promotion of competition in the gas industry. In light of this increased reliance on competition, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the NGA to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the transportation, purchase or sale of natural gas. In addition to the regulations implementing these prohibitions, the FERC has established new regulations that are intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency through, among other things, expanded dissemination of information about the availability and prices of gas sold and new regulations that require both interstate pipelines and certain non-interstate pipelines to post daily information regarding their design capacity and daily scheduled flow volumes at certain points on their systems. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the NGA and the FERC’s regulations to up to $1.0 million per day for each violation. This maximum penalty authority established by statute has been and will continue to be adjusted periodically to account for inflation.
Oil Price Controls and Transportation Rates
Our sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. The price we receive from the sale of these products may be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market. Much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines. Effective as of January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation, subject to specified conditions and limitations. These regulations may tend to increase the cost of transporting crude oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipeline, although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year. Every five years, the FERC must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry. In December 2015, to implement the latest required five-yearly re-determination, the FERC established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes. For the five-year period beginning July 1, 2016, FERC established an annual index adjustment equal to the change in the producer price index for finished goods plus 1.23%. A pipeline trade association advocated a higher percentage adjustment and filed a petition for review of the FERC’s December 2015 indexing order with the D.C. Circuit, which is now pending before the court. The currently effective annual index adjustment may be impacted by the outcome of that appeal. Under FERC’s regulations, liquids pipelines can request a rate increase that exceeds the rate obtained through application of the indexing methodology by using a cost-of-service approach, but only after the pipeline establishes that a substantial divergence exists between the actual costs experienced by the pipeline and the rates resulting from application of the indexing methodology. We are not able at this time to predict the effects of this indexing system or any new FERC regulations on the transportation costs associated with oil production from our oil producing operations.
There regularly are legislative proposals pending in the federal and state legislatures which, if enacted, would significantly affect the petroleum industry. At the present time, it is impossible to predict what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, such proposals might have on us. Similarly, we cannot predict whether or to what extent the trend toward federal deregulation of the petroleum industry will continue, or what the ultimate effect on our sales of oil, gas and other petroleum products will be.
17

Environmental Regulations
Our operations are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit drilling activities on specified lands within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas, require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations, such as pit closure and plugging abandoned wells, and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from production and drilling operations. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations or the issuance of injunctions prohibiting or limiting the extent of our operations. Public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years. The trend of applying more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations to the oil and gas industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting our profitability. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements, our business and prospects could be adversely affected.
We currently own or lease numerous properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas. Although we believe that we have generally implemented appropriate operating and waste disposal practices, prior owners and operators of these properties may not have used similar practices, and hydrocarbons or other waste may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties we own or lease or on or under locations where such waste has been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other waste was not under our control. These properties and the waste disposed thereon may be subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), and analogous state laws as well as state laws governing the management of oil and gas waste. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed waste (including waste disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination) or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination. 
We generate waste that may be subject to RCRA and comparable state statutes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous waste. Furthermore, certain waste generated by our oil and gas operations that are currently exempt from treatment as “hazardous waste” may in the future be designated as “hazardous waste” and therefore become subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements.
CERCLA, also known as the “Superfund” law, and analogous state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on specified classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These classes of persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
Our operations may be subject to the Clean Air Act and comparable state and local requirements. In 1990 Congress adopted amendments to the Clean Air Act containing provisions that have resulted in the gradual imposition of certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from our operations. The EPA and states have developed and continue to develop regulations to implement these requirements. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits and approvals addressing other air emission-related issues. Moreover, changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase our compliance costs. Further, stricter requirements could negatively impact our production and operations. For example, on October 1, 2015, EPA released a final rule tightening the primary and secondary NAAQS for ground-level ozone from its 2008 standard levels of 75 parts per billion (“ppb”) to 70 ppb and is scheduled to make attainment/nonattainment designations for the revised ozone standards by October 1, 2017. Similar initiatives could lead to more stringent air permitting, increased regulation and possible enforcement actions at the local, state, and federal levels. 
Additionally, the EPA has established new air emission control requirements for natural gas and natural gas liquids production, processing and transportation activities, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAPS”) to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities. Among other things, these rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or 
18

“green completions” on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. In addition, gas wells are required to use completion combustion device equipment (i.e., flaring) by October 15, 2012 if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line. Further, the final rules under NESHAPS include maximum achievable control technology (“MACT”) standards for “small” glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves. More recently, in June 2016, the EPA published updates to new source performance standard requirements that would impose more stringent controls on methane and volatile organic compounds emissions from oil and gas development and production operations, including hydraulic fracturing and other well completion activity. The EPA has also announced that it intends to impose methane emission standards for existing sources and has issued information collection requests for oil and natural gas facilities. Similarly in November 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) issued rules requiring additional efforts by producers to reduce venting, flaring, and leaking of natural gas produced on federal and Native American lands. Compliance with these requirements may require modifications to certain of our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business.
Federal regulations require certain owners or operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle oil, such as us, to prepare and implement spill prevention, control, countermeasure and response plans relating to the possible discharge of oil into surface waters. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the United States. The OPA subjects owners and operators of facilities to strict joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a spill, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters. The OPA also requires owners and operators of offshore facilities that could be the source of an oil spill into federal or state waters, including wetlands, to post a bond, letter of credit or other form of financial assurance in amounts ranging from $10.0 million in specified state waters to $35.0 million in federal outer continental shelf waters to cover costs that could be incurred by governmental authorities in responding to an oil spill. These financial assurances may be increased by as much as $150.0 million if a formal risk assessment indicates that the increase is warranted. Noncompliance with OPA may result in varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities. 
Our operations are also subject to the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and analogous state laws that impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters as well as U.S. waters. Pursuant to the requirements of the CWA, the EPA has adopted regulations concerning discharges of storm water runoff. This program requires covered facilities to obtain individual permits or seek coverage under an EPA general permit. Like OPA, the CWA and analogous state laws relating to the control of water pollution provide varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities for releases of petroleum or its derivatives into surface waters or into the ground. Similarly, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to subject hydraulic fracturing operations to federal regulation and to require the disclosure of chemicals used by us and others in the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process. Please read “Item 1A. Risk Factors—We are subject to various environmental risks and governmental regulations, including those relating to benzene emissions, hydraulic fracturing and global climate change, and future regulations may be more stringent resulting in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and gas that we produce.”
The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Some of our operations are located in or near areas that may be designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, such as the Indiana Bat and the Attwater’s Prairie Chicken. In these areas, we may be obligated to develop and implement plans to avoid potential adverse effects to protected species and their habitats, and we may be prohibited from conducting operations in certain locations or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons, when our operations could have an adverse effect on the species. It is also possible that a federal or state agency could restrict drilling activities in certain locations if it is determined that such activities may have a serious adverse effect on a protected species. The presence of a protected species in areas where we operate could result in increased costs of or limitations on our ability to perform operations and thus have an adverse effect on our business. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA, and we are not aware of any proposed listings that will affect our operations. However, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected states.
The Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and comparable local and state provisions restrict the disposal, treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development. Subsurface emplacement of fluids (including disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery) is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that, in some cases, includes the state oil and gas regulatory authority or the state’s environmental authority. These regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities. We believe that we substantially comply with the SDWA and related state provisions.
We also are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign permitting and registration requirements relating to protection of the environment. We believe we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

Global Climate Change
There is increasing attention in the United States and worldwide being paid to the issue of climate change and the contributing effect of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. The EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, regulates GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources under the Clean Air Act Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) and Title V permitting programs. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards, which will be established by the states or, in some instances, by the EPA on a case-by-case basis. The EPA also expanded its existing GHG emissions reporting rule to apply to the oil and gas source category, including oil and natural gas production facilities and natural gas processing, transmission, distribution and storage facilities. Facilities containing petroleum and natural gas systems that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2 equivalent per year were required to report annual GHG emissions to EPA, for the first time by September 28, 2012. In addition, in June 2016, the EPA published updates to new source performance standard requirements that would impose more stringent controls on methane and volatile organic compounds emissions from oil and gas development and production operations, including hydraulic fracturing and other well completion activity.
The U.S. Congress has considered a number of legislative proposals to restrict GHG emissions and more than 20 states, either individually or as part of regional initiatives, have begun taking actions to control or reduce GHG emissions. Efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues. Most recently in April 2016, the United States signed the Paris Agreement, which requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. 
While it is not possible at this time to predict how regulation that may be enacted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing oil and gas exploration in the areas of the United States in which we operate could materially and adversely affect our operations by limiting drilling opportunities or imposing materially increased costs. In addition, existing or new laws, regulations or treaties (including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources) could have a negative impact on our business if such incentives reduce demand for oil and gas.
In addition to the effects of future regulation, the meteorological effects of global climate change could pose additional risks to our operations in the form of more frequent and/or more intense storms and flooding, which could in turn adversely affect our cost of doing business.
Title to Properties
We believe we currently have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in the specific areas in which we operate, except where failure to do so would not have a material adverse effect on our business and operations in such area, taken as a whole. For additional information, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—We may incur losses as a result of title deficiencies.”

Gross acres or gross wells. The total acres or wells, as the case may be, in which a working interest is owned.
Hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a well stimulation process using a liquid (usually water with an amount of chemicals mixed in) that is forced into an underground formation under high pressure to open or enlarge fractures in reservoirs with low permeability to stimulate and improve the flow of hydrocarbons from these reservoirs. As the formation is fractured, a proppant (usually sand or ceramics) is pumped into the fractures to “prop” or keep them from closing after they are opened by the liquid. Hydraulic fracturing is a technology used in shale reservoirs and other unconventional resource plays in order to enable commercial hydrocarbon production.

23

Proved reserves. Has the meaning given to such term in Rule 4-10(a)(22) of Regulation S-X, which defines proved reserves as:
The quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations, prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
The area of a reservoir considered proved includes (i) the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (ii) adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.
In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
Reserves that can be produced economically, based on prices used to estimate reserves, through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when (i) successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir, or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and (ii) the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
Proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves. Reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility, based on pricing used to estimate reserves, at greater distances.
(ii) Undrilled locations are classified as having proved undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time.
(iii) Under no circumstances are estimates for proved undeveloped reserves attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
PV-10 (Non-GAAP). The present value of estimated future revenue to be generated from the production of estimated net proved reserves, net of estimated production and future development costs, based on prices used in estimating the proved reserves and costs in effect as of the date indicated (unless such costs are subject to change pursuant to contractual provisions), without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses, debt service, future income tax expenses, or depreciation, depletion, and amortization, discounted using an annual discount rate of 10 percent. While this measure does not include the effect of income taxes as it would in the use of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows calculation, it does provide an indicative representation of the relative value of the Company on a comparative basis to other companies and from period to period. This is a non-GAAP measure. See “Item 1. Business—Additional Oil and Gas Disclosures—Reconciliation of Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows (GAAP) to PV-10 (Non-GAAP)”
Reasonable certainty. If deterministic methods are used, reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 90% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. A high degree of confidence exists if the quantity is much more likely to be achieved than not, and, as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and 
24

economic data are made to EUR with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease.
Recompletion. The completion for production of an existing well bore in another formation from that in which the well has been previously completed.
Reserves. Estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project.
Reservoir. A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil or gas, or both, that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs.
Standardized measure. The present value, discounted at 10%, of future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves after income taxes, calculated holding prices and costs constant at amounts in effect on the date of the report (unless such prices or costs are subject to change pursuant to contractual provisions) and otherwise in accordance with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission’s rules for inclusion of oil and gas reserve information in financial statements filed with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission.
Undeveloped acreage. Lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil or gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves.
Working interest. The operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and conduct operating activities on the property and a share of production.
