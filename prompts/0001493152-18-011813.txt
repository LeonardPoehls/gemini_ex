Item 1. Business.
General
 
We have recently moved our offices from Oakland County, Michigan, to San Diego, California, proximate to our agricultural and development projects in Baja California, on which our current business operations are focused. The purchase of a condominium unit on July 28, 2009 initiated our real estate development operations directed at purchasing income-producing residential real estate apartment homes, condominiums and houses in the State of Michigan. As of April 30, 2018, we had sold all properties owned in Michigan, and we have refocused our efforts to concentrate on the same line of business for our Cielo Mar development in Baja, California.
Real Estate Development and Marketing Operations


Environmental Objectives in our Operations
 
To make homes more comfortable, we try to, whenever practical, optimize space by creating openness, introducing more natural light, creating better storage areas, as well as aiming to improve insulation, all with a view to make even small condominiums and apartments eco-friendly and practical. This ideology, we believe, will increase property value as well as to further create tenant loyalty in the rental market.
 
For a healthier living environment, we use eco-friendly, paints, primers and adhesives; improve air quality through better ventilation and air filtration in heating and air conditioning system, whenever feasible.
 
Property Acquisition Strategy
 
Each property acquired utilized a separate wholly-owned limited liability company for that particular property. This limited the risk exposure to a particular property solely to that property. Our property management strategy is to deliver quality services, thereby promoting tenant satisfaction, maintaining high tenant retention, and enhancing the value of each of our operating real estate assets through eco-friendly improvements.

In analyzing the potential development of a particular project, we evaluate the geographic, demographic, economic, and financial data, including:
 

● | Households, population and employment growth; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Prevailing rental and occupancy rates in the market area, and possible growth in those rates; and 
● | Location of the property in respect to schools and public transportation. 

Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters
 
Under various federal, state, and local laws and regulations, an owner of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property. Those laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of remediation or removal of the substances may be substantial, and the presence of the substances, or the failure to remediate the substances promptly, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.
Insurance
 
We carry comprehensive property, general liability, fire, extended coverage and environmental on all of our existing properties, with policy specifications, insured limits, and deductibles customarily carried for similar properties.
Baja California
 
Our real estate development operations are now concentrated in Baja California, Mexico. On February 11, 2016, we signed a definitive agreement with Inmobiliaria Contel S.R.L.C.V. (“Contel”) for Progreen to finance the first tract of land of approximately 300 acres which is being developed by Contel for agriculture use.
 
Procon Baja JV, S. de R.L. de C.V.
 
On June 17, 2016, the Company formed Procon Baja JV, S. de R.L. de C.V. (“Procon” or “Procon joint venture”), a subsidiary owned by Progreen (51%) and Contel (49%). Procon is managed by a board of Managing Directors consisting of three members, of which two represent Progreen and one represents Contel, and Jan Telander, our CEO, is the General Manager of Procon. On January 23, 2017, Procon entered into a definitive purchase agreement for, and has took possession of, a large tract of land situated near the town of El Rosario in Baja California, Mexico. The land, planned for residential real estate development, is bordering the Pacific Ocean and covers a total area of approximately 5,000 acres with 4.5 miles of ocean front. The execution of the deed transferring the 5,000-acre oceanfront property to Procon was completed on March 15, 2017, and a Master Plan for all of this land is being created for a resort-type retirement and vacation community with the name “Cielo Mar”. Translated into English, Cielo means “heaven” and Mar means “sea”, the Cielo Mar planned community thus being “heaven by the sea.” The Preliminary Master Plan was published April 19, 2018, and the planning for the first execution phase of the development is currently underway.

In Mexico, as the land cost in Baja California through our joint venture is substantially below market price, we have a distinct advantage and will have a competitive edge as far as pricing is concerned. We initially found substantial amounts of water, which increases the value and attractiveness to the land.
 
On June 15, 2018, Procon entered into a definitive purchase agreement for, and took possession of a second large tract of land covering approximately 2,500 acres, situated less than a mile from the 300 acres that is being developed by Contel. Part of the land, with over 1,000 acres expected to be farmable, is planned for expansion of the ProGreen Farms™ operation.

Agricultural Operations
 
Our agricultural operations are branded under the trademark name, “ProGreen Farms.” We funded our joint operating partner, Contel, for the development of a “pilot” farm operation on the 300-acre parcel at Rancho Arenoso, where 80 acres were developed for farming in 2017.
 
Last year was considered a pilot year where the farm grew 6 different types of chilies to determine the most suitable for the area/soil etc. The farm did harvest some but really only one type produced decent results, which is the type the farm is growing this year. Total income from the harvest last year was approximately $225,000 out of which $50,000 was paid back to Progreen with the balance went to cover the operating costs of the farm.
 
Also in 2017, ProGreen Farms US, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, was set up to handle sales and distribution of Contel’s produce.
 
The farming on the Arenoso farm is progressing well as planned. We will start harvesting in August 2018 and go on through December 2018.
 
A suitable variety of chili pepper with high yield was grown and harvested at the Arenoso farm in 2017, and was subsequently approved by Huy Fong Foods, Inc., resulting in a contract for ProGreen Farms US, LLC to supply red chili peppers to Huy Fong in 2018. The farm will be delivering 2,500 tons (worth $1,200,000) of red chilis to Huy Fong Foods as per the agreement in place, but expect to be producing more like 3,500 or perhaps even 4,000 tons this year on the 40HA or 100 acres we are actively now farming.
 
The surplus we will likely sell to the fresh produce market in Baja as we will be producing late in fall when the availability is very limited and the prices much higher than in the summer months. This will be to buyers that buy and pick up the produce directly at the farm (en campo).
 
With the successful establishment of the pilot farm operation at Rancho Arenoso and a sales contract for 2018, our agriculture operation is well-positioned for growth, with the pilot farm serving as a model for further land development and operations.
