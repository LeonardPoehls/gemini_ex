 Perry Ellis International, organized in 1967, is a global leader in the design, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of branded lifestyle apparel and accessories. We are one of the largest apparel companies in the world with a portfolio consisting of nationally and internationally recognized lifestyle brand names, some of which have a heritage dating back over 100 years. 
 We sell our products under our owned global brands, licensed brands and private retailer labels. Our owned brands include the global designer lifestyle brand, Perry Ellis® and Original Penguin ® by Munsingwear ® (Original Penguin) as well as Ben Hogan ®, Cubavera ®, Farah ®, Grand Slam ®, Jantzen ®, Laundry by Shelli Segal ®, Rafaella ® and Savane ®. We license the Callaway Golf® brand, PGA TOUR® brand, and the Jack Nicklaus® brand for golf apparel, the Jag® brand for swimwear and cover-ups, and the Nike® brand for swimwear and accessories. 
 We have four reportable segments  Mens Sportswear and Swim, Womens Sportswear, Direct-to-Consumer, and Licensing  and we have a strategically diversified global distribution network focused on leading department stores, company-operated retail stores, specialty stores and select licensing partners. We distribute our products primarily to wholesale customers that represent all major levels of retail distribution including department stores, national and regional chain stores, mass merchants, specialty stores, sporting goods stores, the corporate wear market, e-commerce, as well as clubs and independent retailers, in North America and Europe. Our largest customers include Walmart Stores Inc., which includes Sams Wholesale Club (Sams) (together (Walmart)), The Marmaxx Group, Macys, Inc. (Macys), Dillards, Inc. (Dillards) and Kohls Corporation (Kohls). 
 We also distribute through our own retail stores. As of April 1, 2017, we operated 38 Perry Ellis, 14 Original Penguin and two multi-brand retail outlet stores located primarily in upscale retail outlet malls across the United States, United Kingdom and Puerto Rico. As of April 1, 2017, we also operated two Perry Ellis, two Cubavera, 12 Original Penguin and one multi-brand full price retail stores located in upscale demographic markets in the United States and United Kingdom. In addition, we leverage our design, sourcing and logistics expertise by offering a limited number of private label programs to retailers. 
 In fiscal 2017, our Mens Sportswear and Swim segment, which is comprised of mens sportswear, swimwear and accessories, accounted for 73% of our total revenues, our Womens Sportswear segment accounted for 12% of our total revenues, our Direct-to-Consumer segment, which is comprised of retail and e-commerce, accounted for 11% of our total revenues and our licensing segment accounted for approximately 4% of our total revenues. Finally, our U.S. based business represented approximately 87% of total revenues, while our foreign operations represented 13% of total revenues for fiscal 2017. 
 The revenue generated through our licensing business, in which we license to third parties for certain production, sales and/or distribution rights through geographic licensing arrangements, is a significant contributor to our operating income and our arrangements heighten the overall awareness of our brands without requiring us to make capital investments or incur additional operating expenses. As of fiscal 2017, we licensed our brands through five worldwide, 63 domestic and 93 international license agreements in over 150 countries.

 Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe that we have the following competitive strengths in our industry: 
 Portfolio of nationally and internationally recognized brands. We have built a broad and deep portfolio of global and licensed brands. We believe our brands are well-known and have a loyal following of both fashion-conscious consumers and retailers who desire high quality, well-designed fashion apparel and accessories. 
 Diversified business model. We market our products at multiple price points and across multiple channels of distribution, allowing us to provide products to a broad range of consumers, while reducing our reliance on any one demographic segment, merchandise preference or distribution channel. Specifically, we view our business as being well diversified: 
 By brand. We maintain a global portfolio of over 30 highly recognized brands that appeal to fashion conscious consumers across various income levels. We design, source, market and license most of our products on a brand-by-brand basis targeting distinct consumer demographic and lifestyle profiles. For example, we market the Perry Ellis and Original Penguin brands to higher-income consumers, and market the Grand Slam and Savane brands to middle-income consumers. We also market brands that target women through our Rafaella and Laundry by Shelli Segal brands, as well as through our family of golf and swimwear brands which include Callaway, Jantzen and Nike. In addition, our brands such as Gotcha, Manhattan and Pro Player are distributed through licensees. This allows us to maintain strong brand integrity without a direct wholesale or retail commitment of resources. 
 By product. We design and market apparel and accessories in a broad range of both mens and womens product categories, which we believe increases the stability of our business. Our menswear offerings include career and casual sportswear, golf apparel, sports apparel, swimwear, activewear and accessories. Our womenswear offerings include dresses, sportswear, swimwear, activewear and accessories. We believe that our product diversity decreases our dependence on a single product line or fashion trend and contributes substantially to our growth opportunities. 
 By distribution channel. We market our products across multiple levels of retail distribution, allowing us to reach a broad range of consumers domestically and internationally. We distribute our products through luxury stores, department stores, national and regional chain stores, mass merchants, specialty stores, sporting goods stores, the corporate wear market, e-commerce, as well as clubs and independent retailers. Our products are distributed through approximately 25,000 doors at some of the nations leading retailers, including Walmart, the Marmaxx Group, Macys, Dillards and Kohls. We also distribute our products through our own retail stores, which include 38 Perry Ellis, 14 Original Penguin and two multi-brand retail outlet stores located primarily in upscale retail outlet malls across the United States, United Kingdom and Puerto Rico. As of April 1, 2017, we also operated two Perry Ellis, two Cubavera, 12 Original Penguin and one multi-brand full price retail stores located in upscale demographic markets in the United States and United Kingdom. We also operate e-commerce sites for several of our brands. Finally, we have successfully expanded product and brand distribution in the United Kingdom, Canada, Latin America and Europe, and believe additional opportunities exist for further international expansion of our brand base.

----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Leadership position in the Mens Wholesale business. We believe that our established relationships with retailers allow us to maximize the selling space dedicated to our products, monitor our brand presentation and merchandising selection, and proactively introduce new brands and products. Because of our quality brands and products, dedication to customer service, design expertise and sourcing capabilities, we have developed and maintained long-standing relationships with our largest customers. In addition, we are engaged in wholesale growth initiatives that are designed to transform our respective brands displays at select department stores into branded shop-in-shops. By installing customized freestanding fixtures, wall casings and components, decorative items and flooring, as well as deploying specially trained staff, we believe that our shop-in-shops provide department store consumers with a more personalized shopping experience than traditional retail department store configurations. We also service the ecommerce distribution for many of our wholesale customers by fulfilling and mailing orders directly from our distribution facilities. This aspect of our business is becoming more important as more consumers shop on line. These capabilities further elevate our competencies to our retail partners. 
 Growing Licensing business. The strengths of our brands have been instrumental in helping us build our global licensing business. We collaborate with over 160 product licensees who produce and sell what we believe are products requiring specialized expertise that are enhanced by our brands respective strengths. We provide support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design, quality control, advertising, marketing and distribution of licensed products. Our relationships with our product licensees have helped us leverage our success across demographics and categories by taking advantage of their unique expertise, resulting in total royalty revenue for licensed products increasing from $34.7 million in fiscal 2016 to $36.0 million in fiscal 2017. In addition, we have entered into agreements with non-manufacturing third-party licensees who we believe have particular expertise in the distribution of fashion apparel and accessories in specific geographic territories, such as the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, throughout Asia and Australia.

Manufacturing, Sourcing and Distribution. Product design and innovation, including fit, fabric, finish and quality, are important elements across our businesses. We have sourced our products globally for 50 years and employ sophisticated logistics and supply chain management systems to maintain maximum flexibility. Our network of worldwide company-owned sourcing offices and agents enables us to meet our customers needs in an efficient and high quality manner without relying on any one vendor, factory, or country. In fiscal 2017, based on the total units, we sourced our products from Asia 78%, the Middle East 17% and the Americas 5%. We maintain a staff of over 290 experienced sourcing professionals in four offices in China (including Hong Kong), as well as in the United States, Taiwan, Bangladesh, and Vietnam. Our sourcing offices closely monitor our suppliers and provide strict quality assurance analyses that allow us to consistently maintain our high quality standard for our customers. We have a compliance department that works closely with our quality assurance staff to ensure that our sourcing partners comply with Company-mandated and country-specific labor and employment regulations. We believe that sourcing our products allows us to manage our inventories more effectively while avoiding capital investments in production facilities. Because of our sourcing experience, capabilities and relationships, we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of the changing textile and apparel quota environment. We limit our sourcing exposure through, among other measures: (i) shifting of production among countries and factories, (ii) sourcing production to merchandise categories where product expertise exists and (iii) sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements. 
 Design expertise and advanced technology. We maintain a staff of designers, merchandisers and artists who are supported by a staff of design professionals, including assistant designers, technical designers, graphic artists and production assistants. Our in-house design staff designs substantially all of our products using advanced three dimensional computer-aided design technology that minimizes the time-intensive and costly production of sewn prototypes. In addition, this technology provides our customers with products that have been custom designed for their specific needs and meet current fashion trends. We design and employ advanced fabric and design technologies to ensure a proper fit and outstanding performance when creating our womens and mens golf and swimwear apparel. We seek to regularly upgrade and improve our products with the latest in innovative technology while broadening our product offerings. Our goal, to deliver superior performance in all our products, provides our developers and licensees with a clear, overarching direction for the brand and helps them identify new opportunities to create products that meet the changing needs of consumers. We regularly upgrade our computer technology, including our Product Lifecycle Management systems, to enhance our design capabilities, and facilitate communication with our global suppliers and customers on a real-time basis resulting in faster new product developments thereby meeting the ever-changing needs of our customers. 
 Our sales planners have an enhanced ability to manage and monitor our retail customers inventory at the stock keeping unit (SKU) level through utilization of our Oracle Retail Planning system. This system helps planners maximize the sales and margins of our products by identifying opportunities for our retailer customers to improve inventory turns, which reduces our product returns and markdowns and improves our profitability. We use PerrySolutions in-house planning software and Oracle Retail during the assortment planning process to allocate the optimal size/color and quantity mix for the initial retail product rollout. 
 Our Data Warehouse, Geographical Information Systems and IBM SPSS, a forecasting model, are utilized to detect future trends and identify new business opportunities. Our e-commerce environment utilizes Demandware coupled with the best of the breed e-commerce cloud and social media services to create an integrated leading edge environment. We completed implementation of a loyalty system utilizing Salesforce, Oracle-Eloqua, and Starmounts mobile POS. These solutions improve our understanding of our direct-to-consumer market allowing us to engage the customer at the time of purchase resulting in significant increases in revenue per transaction. 
 Proven and experienced management team. Our senior management team averages more than 30 years in the apparel industry and has extensive experience in growing and rejuvenating brands and building strong relationships with global suppliers, licensees and retailers. This industry backdrop coupled with public company 
 
9 
 
 experience, as well as an average of 21 years with Perry Ellis International, provide a deeply seasoned senior management team with strong creative and operational experience. This extensive experience also extends beyond our senior management team and deep into our organization. 
 Our Business Strategy 
 Our goal is to drive increases in both revenue and our profitability with a portfolio of brands that we offer in multiple channels of retail distribution through the following strategies: 
 Continue to strengthen the competitive position and recognition of our lifestyle brands. We intend to continue growing brand awareness and customer loyalty in North America and internationally, in a number of ways including by: 
 

 | Managing our brands individually, and developing a distinctive merchandising and marketing strategy for every product category and distribution channel.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expanding our e-commerce footprint both direct and through our customers by utilizing key platform investments in our digital footprint and our state of the art photography studio.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Maintaining our advertising position in global fashion publications, participating in trade shows, event and celebrity sponsorships, cooperative advertising in print and broadcast media. Increasingly important is our digital connection with consumers  through social media and mobile applications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We partner with leading wholesale customers in national and regional department, chain, mass market, specialty and independent stores in North America and Europe. These longstanding relationships enable us to access large numbers of our key consumers in a targeted manner. In addition, we are engaged in wholesale growth initiatives such as advertising support in the form of point-of-sale fixtures and signage to enhance the presentation and brand image of our products. We also participate in shop-in-shops, which are the primary component of our retail marketing strategy to increase the brand floor space dedicated to our products within our major retail accounts. The design and funding of our concept shops within our major retail accounts has been a key initiative for securing prime floor space, educating the consumer and creating an exciting environment for the consumer to experience our branded products. Our shops enhance our brands presentation within our major retail accounts with a shop-in-shop approach, using dedicated floor space exclusively for our products, including flooring, lighting, walls, displays and images. We participate in incentive programs with our retailer customers, including customer loyalty, discounts, allowances and cooperative advertising funds. We also offer sales incentive programs directly to consumers through our Supreme Perks Loyalty Program, which targets consumers in our direct-to-consumer channel. 
 The strength and agility of our global brands has been instrumental in helping us expand our licensing business. We collaborate with a select number of product licensees who produce and sell products requiring specialized expertise that are enhanced by our brands strengths. In addition, we have entered into agreements with non-manufacturing licensees who have particular expertise in the distribution of our products in countries and geographic territories such as South Korea, the Philippines, the Middle East, China, Latin America and the Caribbean. 
 Expand our product offerings. We have been a leader in mens apparel for over 40 years and believe we can continue to grow this business by leveraging our expertise and experience in design and manufacturing, in our relationships with leading retailers, and in our sourcing capabilities to expand to new product categories by capitalizing on our brands strong awareness and loyalty among consumers. We can both optimize our strong business opportunities and attract new customers to our brands. For example, we expanded the performance attributes for our Perry Ellis collection line to offer casual athleisure components. These product offerings provide complementary additions under the brand that extended its reach beyond the traditional wear to work outfit.

Grow our Direct-to-Consumer channel. We seek to expand and leverage the high gross margin direct-to-consumer channel, which includes e-commerce, outlet stores and full-price stores, and where we control all aspects of the operation, thereby complementing our wholesale business. This business segment operates under a single operating group to ensure our omni-channel operations are interdependent. This has enabled our company to increase comparable store sales with a number of initiatives already under way to increase the size and frequency of purchases by our existing customers and to attract new customers. Such initiatives include, among others, maximizing productivity with existing stores, creating compelling store environments and offering new products, including menswear, small leather goods, and active footwear. 
 E-commerce is our fastest growing direct-to-consumer channel. As a complement to our wholesale business, we currently market Perry Ellis, Original Penguin, Farah, Cubavera and Callaway Golf Apparel products online in the United States and internationally. We are continuing to enhance the online capabilities and functionality of our e-commerce sites to improve the shopping experience and increase sales. At the same time, these enhancements enable us to expand the number of countries to which we are able to ship. In addition, we have increased our indirect e-commerce sales via our retail customers by investing in product presentation and selling capabilities to further strengthen the competitive position and image of our current brands on their respective websites. 
 In addition to e-commerce, our stores allow us to showcase a brands full line of current season products, with fixtures and imagery, which we believe reinforce our brand image and enables us to control the entire customer experience. We intend to expand our store base both domestically and internationally by selectively opening new retail locations for Perry Ellis, Original Penguin and other brands. We also continue to increase global comparable store sales with a number of initiatives already under way to increase the size and frequency of purchases by our existing customers and to attract new customers. Such initiatives include, among others, maximizing the merchandise assortment within existing stores, providing exceptional customer service, creating compelling store environments and offering new products, small leather goods, travel products and accessories. 
 In addition to our direct-to-consumer operations, our licensees, distributors and other independent parties own and operate over 100 stores. These are primarily mono brand stores selling company-branded products with the same look and feel as our company-operated stores. The majority of these stores are located in Latin America and Asia. 
 Grow our international businesses. We believe that our strong brand portfolio and broad product offerings enable us to seek additional growth opportunities in geographic areas where we are underpenetrated, such as Europe and Asia. Our historic growth focused primarily on the wholesale channel within the United States, and accordingly, our revenues are concentrated in that distribution channel. We intend to strengthen our existing markets and successfully expand our business in relatively underdeveloped or under-optimized markets. Our immediate focus is supporting our momentum in Europe, Canada and Latin America while expanding our penetration in Asia and the Middle East. For example, during fiscal 2017 we introduced Nike Swim into Latin America and Europe. We also brought Ben Hogan into the market in Europe. We also seek to expand revenue through licensing partnerships across the Asian, Middle Eastern, African and Indian markets. We executed new licensing relationships in Latin America and Asia for Perry Ellis, and in Europe for Original Penguin, during fiscal 2017 as well. 
 Adapt to our continually changing marketplace. We will continue to make investments and implement strategies to meet the growing needs of our customers on a timely basis in the ever-changing apparel industry. We are currently focusing on expanding our business in the following areas: 
 

 | We continue to elevate our Perry Ellis brand by leveraging the creative talent of our design and merchandising teams. We hold runway shows which reinforce Perry Ellis designer status and high-fashion image, creating excitement around the collections and generating global multimedia press coverage. We continue to make investments in global advertising and integrated marketing programs, with the popular Very Perry advertising campaign as the current cornerstone of our global marketing strategies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
11 
 

 | We implemented a successful wholesale strategy for Original Penguin, transitioning from a classification business to full-lifestyle offerings at wholesale in order to more efficiently and effectively exploit the development opportunities for the brand. The Be an Original spirit of the brand inspires a wide range of contemporary, all-American designs that appeal to a diverse array of global consumers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We continue to increase our wholesale sales by increasing shop-in-shops for Perry Ellis, Original Penguin and Rafaella. We believe that our shop-in-shop initiatives effectively communicate our brand image within the department store, enhance the presentation of our merchandise and create a more personalized shopping experience for department store customers. We plan to grow our North American shop-in-shop footprint at select department stores by continuing to convert existing wholesale door space into shop-in-shops and expanding the size of existing shop-in-shops.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We are a leading manufacturer of golf lifestyle products and our branded portfolio includes Callaway Golf, PGA TOUR, Grand Slam, Ben Hogan, and Jack Nicklaus. We believe there is opportunity to capitalize on the evolution of golf apparel which continues to replace traditional sportswear attire and permits us to expand across multiple distribution channels.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We are focused on several initiatives to increase our direct-to-consumer sales, including measured growth of our retail stores as well as maximizing sales and distribution through our e-commerce websites. Operationally, we seek to maximize the omni-channel experience  through providing exclusive assortments available online and in our stores as well as maximizing higher margin businesses including fragrance, footwear and accessories which also create a complete branded experience for the consumer.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We continue to evaluate our businesses for productivity and profitability. This year, we continued to focus on cost controls within cost of goods sold and selling general and administrative expenses, through process enhancements, inventory management and consolidation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Expand our licensing opportunities. We believe licensing to third parties is an attractive opportunity for our brands by providing increased customer exposure domestically and internationally, as well as opportunities for future product extensions. We intend to continue to expand the international distribution of our brands through licensing. This year, we entered into 22 new licensing agreements to expand our product offerings under our well-known brands and broaden the markets that we serve. We have over 160 license agreements, covering over 150 countries outside of the United States, to use our brands in numerous product categories, including apparel, accessories, footwear, soft home goods and fragrances. We have an active pipeline of new agreements as we seek to expand product categories and markets. 
 We provide support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design, quality control, advertising, marketing and distribution of licensed products. We are focusing resources on globalizing core brands and upgrading existing licensees. We are using our competency in both mens and womens to add additional categories and geographic regions to our current list of licenses in the years ahead. Licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of brands and product categories. In addition to the revenues and brand awareness that licensing provides us, we also believe that licensing our brands benefits us by providing significant high-margin operating income contribution. 
 Pursue strategic acquisitions and opportunities that leverage and enhance our global product offerings. We continually review acquisition opportunities and believe that our existing infrastructure and management depth will enable us to complete additional acquisitions in the apparel industry should there be an attractive prospect. While we believe we have a diverse portfolio of brands with growth potential, we will continue to explore trademarks and licensing opportunities that we believe are additive to our overall business. New license opportunities allow us to fill new product and brand portfolio needs. We take a disciplined approach to acquisitions, seeking business opportunities that we can grow profitably and expand by leveraging our infrastructure and core competencies and, where appropriate, by extending the brand through licensing.

Recent Developments 
 In November 2016, we paid off our existing real estate mortgage loan and refinanced our main administrative office, warehouse and distribution facility in Miami with a $21.7 million mortgage loan. The loan is due on November 22, 2026. The interest rate is 3.715% per annum. Monthly payments of principal and interest approximate $112,000, based on a 25-year amortization with the outstanding principal due at maturity. In November 2016, we also refinanced our Tampa facility with a $13.2 million mortgage loan. The loan is due on November 22, 2026. The interest rate is 3.715% per annum. Monthly payments of principal and interest approximate $68,000, based on a 25-year amortization with the outstanding principal due at maturity. 
 Products and Product Design 
 Perry Ellis International has assembled a world-class design team, positioned in critical locations around the world. The extensive team is seasoned and well-versed in many product categories. The companys core competency continues to remain menswear, offering products ranging from casual to career sportswear, niche lifestyle apparel in the Latin-inspired markets, emerging Big and Tall markets, as well as technology-rich innovation in the market for authentic golf. Key sport extensions include swim, training and the corresponding accessories. Womenswear continues as a powerful opportunity for the company, with ever-expanding offerings in the sportswear and dress markets, as well as parallel extensions to the mens product stable in swim and active.
 We continue to make technology investment a priority in all areas of the Company. The in-house design organization continues to benefit from the latest updates in state-of-the-art computer aided design (CAD) technology. Woven and knitted fabric patterns, print patterns and silhouette enhancements are mapped and confirmed with speed and accuracy, as well as with great cost-efficiency. The latest evolutions in style and fashion quickly travel from concept to factory-ready reality. 
 Our creative mission is to offer and market fashion-right branded lifestyle products that appeal to a broad and diverse customer base. Extensive consumer and fashion trend research, along with the ever-vigilant monitoring of retail sales, enables us to deliver the right products at the right time to the right sector. 
 Licensing Operations 
 We license certain brands to third parties for various product categories in distribution channels and countries where we may not distribute our brands directly. Licensing enhances the images of our brands by widening the range, product offerings and distribution of products sold under our brands without requiring us to make capital investments or incur additional operating expenses. As a result of this strategy, we are experienced in identifying licensing opportunities and have established relationships with numerous licensees. Our licensing operation is also a significant contributor to our operating income. 
 As of January 28, 2017, we were the licensor of over 160 license agreements, for various products including footwear, mens suits, sportswear, dress shirts, tailored clothing, underwear, loungewear, outerwear, activewear, neckwear, fragrances, eyewear, accessories and home, and for various international territories. Wholesale sales of licensed products by our licensees were approximately $723.0 million, $697.0 million, and $637.0 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We received royalties from these sales of approximately $36.0 million, $34.7 million, and $31.7 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We believe that our long-term licensing opportunities will continue to grow domestically and internationally. Although the Perry Ellis brand has international recognition, we still perceive the brand to be under-penetrated in international markets such as Europe, Latin America and Asia. We are actively working to optimize and expand our base of licensees for the Perry Ellis brand in international markets. We believe that our brand and licensing experience will enable us to capitalize on these international opportunities and that our operations in Europe will assist us in this endeavor. 
 We have been successful with licensing our Original Penguin brand, both domestically and internationally, in categories such as footwear, fragrance, eyewear, dress shirts, tailored clothing, neckwear and kids apparel. We recently added accessory licenses to both Laundry by Shelli Segal and Rafaella and believe that there are additional categories such as handbags and footwear which we are actively working on. Other brands within our portfolio we license for certain product categories and territories include Farah, Jantzen, Gotcha, Manhattan, and Ben Hogan among others.

To maintain a brands image, we closely monitor our licensees and approve all licensed products. In evaluating a prospective licensee, we consider the candidates experience in product design and manufacturing, financial stability, marketing ability and experience in wholesale and retail. We also evaluate the marketability and compatibility of the proposed products with our brands. We regularly monitor product design, development, merchandising and marketing of licensees, and schedule meetings throughout the year with licensees to ensure product quality and brand consistency. We expose our products and fashion collections to our licensees and share our expectations of product positioning in the marketplace. In addition to approving, in advance, all licensees products, we also approve their advertising, promotional and packaging materials. 
 As part of our licensing strategy, we work with our licensees to further enhance the development, image, and sales of their products. We offer licensees marketing support, and our relationships with retailers help the licensees generate higher revenues. 
 Our license agreements generally extend for a period of three to five years with options to renew prior to expiration for an additional multi-year period based upon a licensee meeting certain performance criteria. The typical agreement requires that the licensee pay us the greater of a royalty based on a percentage of the licensees net sales of the licensed products or a guaranteed minimum royalty that typically increases annually over the term of the agreement. Generally, licensees are required to contribute to us additional funds for advertising and promotion of the brand. 
 Marketing, Advertising and Promotions 
 Our strategy to drive demand and sell through of our products begins with our portfolio of brands across the four business segments. Each brand has a defined positioning strategy, product focus, target consumer segment, geographic market focus, and distribution channel approach. 
 We leverage data and consumer insights to inform our strategies to build loyalty and engagement with current consumers as well as attract and acquire new ones. By considering our end consumers purchasing journey from discovery to consideration to purchase and retention, we develop initiatives and communications to help our brands and products to be understood and desired. 
 We seek to build a relationship with our end consumers. Through direct marketing and targeted digital communications, we segment relevant messaging based on consumer preferences. Additionally, we reward end consumers with special offers, advance product releases, and exclusive access with Supreme Perks, our loyalty program. 
 Most of our creative marketing work is done through an in-house creative agency model. This team creates brand identity elements, packaging, advertising, sales materials, and digital content. We connect with consumers to build brand equity and drive retail traffic through extensive use of digital media including social media, branded content, digital advertising, search marketing, and email. Our digital marketing strategies have continued to evolve as mobile consumption of communications has become ubiquitous. We utilize relevant traditional media including fashion and lifestyle magazines and geo-targeted billboards based on the target consumer profile by brand. In addition, we seek editorial coverage for our brands and products through traditional media outlets as well as the less traditional, and growing importance of influencers. 
 Our marketing efforts with wholesale partners are strong and omni channel in their orientation. Our marketing and sales executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers and retailers at the points of sale. We have dedicated resources to enable the best brand and product representation on our retail partners websites in an effort to maximize this growing channel. Additionally, our reach towards targeted consumers is increased by cooperative advertising programs with some retailers. Ranging from in-store displays, digital advertising, direct mail, and email to promotional activities, we are committed to helping our retail partners drive demand and sales. We believe we have opportunities to expand our brand portfolio online around the world, and have developed omni-channel concepts to better serve consumers as they shop across channels.

Distribution and Customers 
 We operate 38 Perry Ellis, 14 Original Penguin and two multi-brand retail outlet stores and two Perry Ellis, two Cubavera and 12 Original Penguin and one multi-brand full-price retail stores. We also operate e-commerce sites for several of our brands with goals to expand our e-commerce offerings. 
 We believe that customer service is a key factor in successfully marketing our products. We coordinate efforts with customers to develop products meeting their specific needs using our design expertise and CAD technology. Utilizing our sourcing capabilities, we strive to produce and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis. 
 We sell merchandise to a broad spectrum of retailers, including national and regional chains, department, mass merchant and specialty stores. Our largest customers include Walmart, The Marmaxx Group and Macys. We have developed and maintained long-standing relationships with these customers. Additionally, we sell merchandise to other retailers such as: Kohls, Belk, Dillards and Hudson Bay Company. We also sell merchandise to corporate wear distributors. 
 Net sales to our five largest customers accounted for approximately 46%, 47%, and 49% of net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. For fiscal 2017, two customers accounted for over 10% of net sales; Walmart accounted for 13% and The Marmaxx Group accounted for 10%. For fiscal 2016, three customers accounted for over 10% of net sales; Walmart accounted for 12%, The Marmaxx Group accounted for 11% and Macys accounted for 10% of net sales, respectively. For fiscal 2015, four customers accounted for over 10% of net sales; Walmart accounted for 14% and Kohls, Macys and The Marmaxx Group each accounted for 10% of net sales. 
 Information Systems 
 Our in-house sales staff is responsible for customer follow-up and support, including monitoring prompt order fulfillment and timely delivery. We utilize EDI and a self-hosted site for certain customers in order to provide advance-shipping notices, process orders and conduct billing operations. In addition, certain customers use the EDI system to communicate their weekly inventory requirements per store to us. We then fill these orders either by shipping directly to the individual stores or by sending shipments, individually packaged and bar coded by store, to a centralized customer distribution center. 
 We use PerrySolutions in-house planning software that enables our sales planners to manage our retail customers inventory at the SKU level. In addition, we use Oracle Retail during the assortment planning process to allocate the correct quantities for the initial rollout of product at retail. These systems help us maximize sales and margins of our products by increasing inventory turns for the retailer, which in turn reduces our product returns and markdowns and increases our profitability. We also use demographic mapping data software that helps us develop specific micro-market plans for our customers and provide them with enhanced returns on our various product lines. Our Data Warehouse, Geographical Information Systems and IBM SPSS are utilized to detect future trends and identify new business opportunities. Our e-commerce environment utilizes Demandware coupled with the best of breed e-commerce, Cloud and social media services creating an integrated leading edge environment. 
 We use the Oracle Retail suite of products with the goal of reducing markdowns, increasing inventory turns and increasing revenues while automating the process. The different modules allow us to monitor our customers product by store and quickly react to changes in consumer behavior. The suite also includes best of breed store inventory and point of sales software, which allows us to keep just in time inventory at our retail stores. This investment shows our commitment to understanding our consumer in order to strengthen our brands as well as our effort to support the continued expansion of our direct retail businesses. Additionally, we invested in Trade Management Oracle Financials software to quickly and positively resolve customer claims. 
 We will begin implementation of a new JDA warehouse management system during fiscal 2018. 
 In addition, we use Google Apps for Work to provide real-time collaboration across our global offices, with face to face video conferencing available to every associate, for training and business meetings.

Seasonality and Backlog 
 Our products are geared towards lighter weight apparel generally worn during the spring and summer months. We believe that this seasonality is balanced with fall, winter and holiday merchandise. The swimwear business, however, is highly seasonal in nature, with the vast majority of our sales occurring in our first and fourth quarters. 
 We generally receive orders from our retailers approximately five to seven months prior to shipment. For the majority of our sales, we have orders from our retailers before we place orders with our suppliers. A summary of the order and delivery cycle for our four primary selling seasons, excluding swimwear, is illustrated below: 
 

Merchandise Season | Advance Order Period | Delivery Period to Retailers
Spring | July to September | January to March 
Summer | October to December | April and May 
Fall | January to March | June to September 
Holiday | April to June | October and November 

 Sales and receivables are recorded when inventory is shipped. The dollar amount of our order backlog as of any date may not be indicative of actual future shipments and, accordingly, is not material to an understanding of the business taken as a whole. The amount of unfilled orders at a point in time is affected by a number of factors, including the mix of product, the timing of the receipt and processing of customer orders and the scheduling of the sourcing and shipping of the product, which in most cases depends on the desires of the customer. Our backlog is also affected by an on-going trend among retailers to reduce the lead-time on their orders. In recent years, our customers have been more cautious of their inventory levels and have delayed placing orders and re-orders compared to our previous experience. 
 Supply of Products and Quality Control 
 We currently use independent contract manufacturers to supply the substantial majority of the products we sell. Of the total units of sourced products in fiscal 2017, 78% was sourced from suppliers in Asia, 17% was sourced from suppliers in the Middle East and 5% was sourced from suppliers in the Americas, respectively. We believe that the use of numerous independent contract manufacturers allows us to maximize production flexibility, while avoiding significant capital expenditures, work-in-process inventory build-ups and the costs of maintaining and operating production facilities. We have had relationships with some suppliers for over 30 years, however, none of these relationships is formal nor require either party to purchase or supply any fixed quantity of product. 
 The vast majority of our products are purchased as full packages, where we place an order with the supplier and the supplier purchases all the raw materials, assembles the garments and ships them to our distribution facilities or third party facilities. 
 We maintain a staff of experienced sourcing professionals in four buying offices in China (including Hong Kong), as well as the United States, Taiwan, Bangladesh, and Vietnam. This staff sources our products worldwide, monitors our suppliers purchases of raw material, and monitors production at contract manufacturing facilities in order to ensure quality control and timely delivery. We also operate through independent agents in Asia and the Middle East. Our sourcing personnel based in our United States offices perform similar functions with respect to our suppliers worldwide. We conduct inspections of samples of product prior to cutting by contractors, during the manufacturing process and prior to shipment. We also have full-time quality assurance inspectors located globally. 
 Generally, the foreign contractors purchase the raw material in accordance with our specifications. Raw materials, which are in most instances made and/or colored especially for us, consist principally of piece goods and yarn and are specified by us to be purchased from a number of foreign and domestic textile mills and converters. 
 We are committed to ethical sourcing standards and require our independent contractors to comply with our code of conduct. We monitor compliance by our foreign contract manufacturers with applicable laws and regulations including labor and employment. As part of our compliance program, we maintain compliance departments in the United States and overseas and routinely perform audits of our contract manufacturers and require corrective action when necessary.

Import Operations and Import Restrictions 
 Our import operations are subject to constraints imposed by bilateral trade agreements between the United States and a number of foreign countries. These agreements impose quotas on the amount and type of goods that can be imported into the United States from some countries. Most of our imported products are also subject to United States customs duties. 
 We closely monitor developments in quotas, duties, and tariffs and continually seek to minimize our exposure to these risks through, among other things, geographical diversification of our contract manufacturers, allocating overseas production to product categories where more quotas are available, and shifting of production among countries and manufacturers. 
 Under the terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, WTO members removed all quotas effective January 1, 2005. Although the danger of quota embargoes has subsided since the removal of quotas for WTO member countries, threats to some apparel categories in China and Vietnam present themselves on occasion through proposed protectionist legislation in the U.S. Congress. We monitor these events closely and our board and executive level memberships in various apparel trade associations ensure early awareness of developments and timely communication of developments to our sourcing staff. 
 We believe that our extensive management and sourcing capability, our flexible sourcing model, and our experience and relationships throughout the world enable us to take advantage of the changing textile and apparel environment. Because of our sourcing experience, capabilities and relationships, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the changing textile and apparel quota environment. 
 Competition 
 The apparel industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Our competitors include numerous apparel designers, manufacturers, importers, licensors, ecommerce providers, and our own customers private label programs, many of which are larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than we have available to us. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the industry are: (1) brand name and brand identity, (2) timeliness, consistency, reliability and quality of services provided, (3) market share and visibility, (4) price, and (5) the ability to anticipate customer and consumer demands and maintain appeal of products to customers. 
 We strive to focus on these points and have proven our ability to anticipate and respond quickly to customer demands with our brands, range of products and our ability to operate within the industrys production and delivery constraints. We believe that our continued dedication to customer service, product assortment and quality control, as well as our aggressive pursuit of licensing opportunities, directly addresses the competitive factors in all market segments. Our established brands and relationships with retailers have resulted in a loyal following of customers. 
 We understand that the level of competition and the nature of our competitors vary by product segment. In particular, in the mass market channel, manufacturers constitute our main competitors in this less expensive segment of the market, while high profile domestic and foreign designers and licensors account for our main competitors in the more upscale segment of the market. Although we have been able to compete successfully to date, there can be no assurance that significant new competitors will not develop in the future. 
 Trademarks 
 Trademarks, trade names, copyrights and domain names, as well as related logos and designs are valuable in the development and marketing of our products and are important to our continued success including the growth of our international licensed businesses. We have registered our material trademarks in the United States and in more than 150 countries where our products are manufactured or sold. We regard our trademarks and other proprietary rights as valuable assets that are critical in the marketing of our products, and, therefore, we vigorously protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights against infringements.

Environmental Matters 
 We are committed to minimizing the negative impact of our business activities on the environment and believe our operations are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, our business activities could be negatively impacted by severe weather conditions, which could affect the sale of our products or disrupt our sourcing. 
Employees 
 As of March 2017 and 2016, we had approximately 2,500 and 2,700, employees worldwide, respectively. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
