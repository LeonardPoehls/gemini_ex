 Overview 
         We are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative treatments and therapies primarily for rare and orphan diseases. We are initially focusing on sickle cell disease, or SCD, a genetic disorder and a significant unmet medical need. Our lead product candidate is an oral pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine, or PGLG, treatment that demonstrated positive clinical results in our completed Phase 3 clinical trial for sickle cell anemia and sickle ß0-thalassemia, two of the most common forms of SCD. 
         In the Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center clinical trial which enrolled a total of 230 adult and pediatric patients as young as five years of age, at 31 sites in the United States, PGLG treatment was administered up to 30 grams per day and demonstrated a 25% decrease in the median frequency of sickle cell crises and 33% decrease in the median number of hospitalizations, as compared to placebo. Based on an analysis, utilizing pre-specified statistical methods, the difference between groups was statistically significant; p=0.0052 and p=0.0045, respectively. Other clinically relevant endpoints showed similar results such as a 63% lower incidence of acute chest syndrome (p=0.0028), 41% less cumulative days in hospital (p=0.022) and 56% delay in onset of the first sickle cell crisis (p=0.0152). The safety data collected demonstrated a safety profile similar to that of placebo. 
         Based on the results of this single Phase 3 clinical trial and other supportive studies, we have submitted to the FDA a New Drug Application, or NDA, for our orally-administered PGLG treatment for SCD. The deadline by which the FDA must review the NDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, is July 7, 2017. 
         The PGLG treatment represents the first potential treatment for pediatric patients with SCD, and the first potential new treatment in nearly 20 years for adult patients. 
         If the FDA approves our NDA, we intend to market in the United States our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD patients who are at least five years old. L-glutamine for the treatment of SCD has received Fast Track designation from the FDA, as well as Orphan Drug designation from both the FDA and the European Commission, or EC. 
         We plan to market our L-glutamine treatment in the United States, if approved, either by strategic partnership or by building our own targeted sales force or some combination thereof. We intend to utilize strategic partnerships to market our treatment in the rest of the world. 
         SCD is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fıbrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle-shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with SCD suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crisis, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crisis causes excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may 
 5

   lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. 
         Our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment and the placebo were randomized by site and by patients using hydroxyurea, a chemotherapeutic agent first approved for SCD by the FDA in 1998. All participants other than those who received a placebo, including children, received up to 30 grams of pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment daily, dissolved in liquid, split between morning and eveningthe same dosage as our Phase 2 clinical trial completed in 2009. 
         We interpret the results of our Phase 3 clinical trial to indicate that our oral pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD, when taken on a daily basis by a patient with SCD, can potentially decrease the incidence of sickle cell crisis by restoring the flexibility and function of red blood cells in patients with SCD. Further, we interpret these results to indicate that our prescription grade L-glutamine product candidate can reduce the number of costly hospitalizations as well as unexpected emergency room and urgent care visits from patients with SCD. L-glutamine enhances nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD, synthesis to reduce excessive oxidative stress in sickle red blood cells that induces much of the damage leading to characteristic symptoms of SCD. 
         Although non-prescription L-glutamine supplements are available, we are not aware of any reports in peer reviewed literature demonstrating their clinical safety and effectiveness for the treatment of SCD in controlled clinical trials, and they have not been approved by the FDA as a prescription drug for SCD. We believe that our pharmaceutical grade, consistent formulation of L-glutamine may be able to meet the rigorous safety and effectiveness requirements of regulatory agencies for approval, as a prescription drug, and if so, may be preferred by treating physicians and payors as compared to non-prescription L-glutamine supplements. 
         We have extensive experience in the field of SCD, including the development, outsourced manufacturing and conduct of clinical trials of our L-glutamine product candidate for the treatment of SCD. Our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Yutaka Niihara, M.D., MPH, is a leading hematologist in the field of SCD. Dr. Niihara is licensed to practice medicine in both the United States and Japan and has been actively engaged in SCD research and the care of patients with SCD for over 20 years, primarily at the University of California Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, or LA BioMed, a nonprofit biomedical research institute. 
         To a lesser extent, we are also engaged in the marketing and sale of NutreStore L-glutamine powder for oral solution, which has received FDA approval, as a treatment for short bowel syndrome, or SBS, in patients receiving specialized nutritional support when used in conjunction with a recombinant human growth hormone that is approved for this indication. Our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Newfield Nutrition, sells L-glutamine as a nutritional supplement under the brand name AminoPure through retail stores in multiple states in the United States and via importers and distributors in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. Since inception, we have generated minimal revenues from the sale and promotion of NutreStore and AminoPure. 
   Sickle Cell DiseaseMarket Overview 
         Sickle cell disease is a genetic blood disorder that affects 20-25 million people worldwide, and occurs with increasing frequency among those whose ancestors are from regions including sub-Saharan Africa, South America, the Caribbean, Central America, the Middle East, India and Mediterranean regions such as Turkey, Greece and Italy. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there are as many as 100,000 patients with SCD in the United States, and we estimate there are approximately 80,000 patients in the European Union. In regions such as Central Africa, 90% of patients with SCD die by age five and 99% of patients die by age 20. In all regions, SCD requires ongoing physician care and considerable medical intervention. The overall survival of patients in the 
 6

   United States with sickle cell anemia correlates with the severity of their disease state, especially the number of crises per year. 
         SCD is characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fıbrous, causing the red blood cells of patients with SCD to become sickle-shaped, inflexible and adhesive rather than round, smooth and flexible. The complications associated with SCD occur when these inflexible and sticky cells block, or occlude, small blood vessels, which can then cause severe and chronic pain throughout the body due to insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, or ischemia, and inflammation. According to an article in Annals of Internal Medicine, "In the Clinic: Sickle Cell Disease" by M.H. Steinberg (September 2011), which we refer to as the Steinberg Article, this leads to long-term organ damage, diminished exercise tolerance, increased risk of stroke and infection and decreased lifespan. 
         Sickle cell crisis, a broad term covering a range of disorders, is one of the most devastating complications of SCD. Types of sickle cell crisis include:
 

Vaso-occlusive crisis, characterized by obstructed blood flow to organs such as the bones,
liver, kidney, eye or central nervous system; 
Aplastic crisis, characterized by acute anemia typically due to viral infection; 
Hemolytic crisis, characterized by accelerated red blood cell death and hemoglobin loss; 
Splenic sequestration crisis, characterized by painful enlargement of the spleen due to trapped
red blood cells; and 
Acute chest syndrome, a potentially life-threatening obstruction of blood supply to the lungs
characterized by fever, chest pain, cough and lung infiltrates. 

         According to the Steinberg Article, acute chest syndrome affects more than half of all patients with SCD and is a common reason for hospitalization. Other symptoms and complications of SCD include swelling of the hands and feet, infections, pneumonia, vision loss, leg ulcers, gallstones and stroke. 
         A crisis is characterized by excruciating musculoskeletal pain, visceral pain and pain in other locations. These crises occur periodically throughout the life of a person with SCD. In adults, the acute pain typically persists for five or ten days or longer, followed by a dull, aching pain generally ending only after several weeks and sometimes persisting between crises. According to the Steinberg Article, frequency of sickle cell crises varies within patients with SCD from rare occurrences to occurrences several times a month. Approximately 30% of patients have rare crises, 50% have occasional crises, and 20% have weekly or monthly crises. Crisis frequency tends to increase late in the second decade of life and to decrease after the fourth decade. The overall survival of patients in the United States with sickle cell anemia correlates with the severity of their disease state, especially the number of crises per year. 
         According to Hematology in Clinical Practice by Robert S. Hillman et. al. (5th ed. 2011), patients with more than three sickle cell crises per year will experience fatal complications during the fourth and fifth decades of life whereas patients who experience between 1 and 3 crises per year have a median survival of nearly 50 years. 
         Treatment of sickle cell crisis is burdensome and expensive for patients and payors, as it encompasses costs for hospitalization, emergency room visits, urgent care visits, and prescription pain medication. According to an article in American Journal of Hematology, "The Burden of Emergency Department Use for Sickle Cell Disease: An Analysis of the National Emergency Department Sample Database" by S. Lanzkron (October 2010), there were approximately 70,000 hospitalizations and 230,000 emergency room visits with a combined emergency room and hospital inpatient charges for these SCD patients estimated to be $2.4 billion in 2006.We plan to market our PGLG treatment in the United States, if approved, by either strategic partnership or by building our own targeted sales force of 
 7

   approximately 20 to 30 sales representatives. We intend to utilize strategic partnerships to market our treatment in the rest of the world. 
         We believe our oral PGLG treatment for SCD, when taken on a daily basis by a patient with SCD, will decrease the incidence of sickle cell crisis by restoring the flexibility and function of red blood cells in patients with SCD. Further, we believe our PGLG product candidate will reduce the number of costly hospitalizations as well as unexpected emergency room and urgent care visits from patients with SCD. The ability to attain such results is attributable to the PGLG treatment enhancing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD, synthesis to reduce excessive oxidative stress in sickle red blood cells that induces much of the damage leading to characteristic symptoms of SCD. 
         Although non-prescription L-glutamine supplements are available as dietary supplements which are generally marketed without undergoing an in-depth FDA approval process, are not subject to prescription, are generally not reimbursed fully or at all, and are not subject to the rigorous quality control standards required for pharmaceutical grade agents by regulatory authorities. Unlike prescription drug products, manufacturers of dietary supplements may not make claims that their dietary supplement products will cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease. Accordingly, we believe non-pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine formulations and dietary supplements will not consistently be effective in the long-term treatment of SCD. We believe that, if approved by regulatory agencies, treating physicians and payors will favor our PGLG treatment over other forms of L-glutamine. Furthermore, we are not aware of any reports in peer-reviewed literature of any demonstrations of their clinical effectiveness in controlled clinical trials and they have not been approved by the FDA as a prescription drug for SCD. We believe our pharmaceutical grade, consistent formulation of L-glutamine will meet the rigorous safety and effectiveness requirements of regulatory agencies for approval as a prescription drug and will be preferred by treating physicians and payors as compared to non-prescription L-glutamine supplements. 
 


Limitations of the Current Standard of Care 

         The only approved pharmaceutical targeting sickle cell crisis is hydroxyurea, which is available in both generic and branded formulations. Hydroxyurea, a drug originally developed as an anticancer chemotherapeutic agent, has been approved as a once-daily oral treatment for reducing the frequency of sickle cell crisis and the need for blood transfusions in adult patients with recurrent moderate-to-severe sickle cell crisis. While hydroxyurea has been shown to reduce the frequency of sickle cell crisis in some patient groups, it is not suitable for many patients due to significant toxicities and side effects and is not approved by the FDA for pediatric use. In particular, hydroxyurea can cause a severe decrease in the number of blood cells in a patient's bone marrow, which may increase the risk that the patient will develop a serious infection or bleeding, or that the patient will develop certain cancers. Another potential treatment option for SCD, bone marrow transplant, is limited in its use due to the lack of availability of matched donors and the risk of serious complications, including graft versus host disease, infection and potentially death, as well as by its high cost. 
         Upon onset of sickle cell crisis, the current standard of care is focused on symptom management. Narcotics are typically used for the management of acute pain associated with sickle cell crisis. Pain management often starts with oral medications taken at home at the onset of pain. However, if the pain is not relieved, or if it progresses, patients may seek medical attention in a clinic setting or emergency department. Pain that is not controlled in these settings may require hospitalization for more potent pain medications, typically opioids administered intravenously. The patient must stay in the hospital to receive these intravenous pain medications until the sickle cell crisis resolves and the pain subsides. Other supportive measures during hospitalization include hydration, supplemental oxygen and treatment of any concurrent infections or other conditions. 
 8

           According to Hematology in Clinical Practice, by Robert S. Hillman et. al. (5th ed. 2011), sickle cell crisis, once it has started, almost always results in tissue damage at the affected site in the body, increasing the importance of preventative measures. While pain medications can be effective in managing pain during sickle cell crisis, they do not affect or resolve the underlying vascular occlusion, tissue ischemia or potential tissue damage. Additionally, opioid narcotics that are generally prescribed to treat pain can also lead to tissue or organ damage and resulting complications and morbidities, prolonged hospital stays and associated continuation of pain and suffering. Given the duration and frequency of sickle cell crises, addiction to these opioid narcotics is also a significant concern. 
 


Our Solution of a Pharmaceutical Grade L-glutamine Treatment for SCD 

         Our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment, if approved, may provide a safe and effective means for reducing the frequency of sickle cell crisis in patients with SCD and reducing the need for costly hospital stays or treatment with opioid narcotics. Published academic research identifies L-glutamine as a precursor to NAD and its reduced form known as NADH. NAD is the major molecule that regulates and prevents oxidative damage in red blood cells. Several published studies have identified that sickle red blood cells have a significantly increased rate of transport of glutamine, which appears to be driven by the cells' need to promote NAD synthesis, protecting against the oxidative damage and thereby leading to further improvement in their regulation of oxidative stress. In turn this made sickle red blood cells less adhesive to cells of the interior wall of blood vessels. This implied that there is decreased chance of blockage of blood vessels especially the small ones. In summary, improved regulation of oxidative stress appears to lead to less obstruction or blockage of small blood vessels, thereby alleviating a major cause of the problems that patients with SCD face. 
         Several of the studies in which Dr. Niihara has participated have been published in peer-reviewed academic research journals. These publications include, "L-glutamine Therapy Reduces Endothelial Adhesion of Sickle Red Blood Cells to Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells" by Yutaka Niihara et al., published in BMC Blood Disorders (2005), "Oral L-glutamine Therapy for Sickle Cell Anemia: I. Subjective Clinical Improvement and Favorable Change in Red Cell NAD Redox Potential" by Yutaka Niihara et al., published in the American Journal of Hematology (1998) and "Increased Red Cell Glutamine Availability in Sickle Cell Anemia: Demonstration of Increased Active Transport, Affinity, and Increased Glutamate Level in Intact Red Cells" by Yutaka Niihara et al., published in the Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine (1997). 
         In December 2013, we completed a Phase 3 prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group multicenter clinical trial to measure, over a 48-week time frame, as its primary outcome, the reduction in the number of occurrences of sickle cell crises experienced by patients in the trial. This Phase 3 clinical trial enrolled a total of 230 patients across 31 clinical trial sites in the United States. Study participants included adults and children as young as five years of age. All participants other than those who received placebo, including children, received up to 30 grams of pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment daily, dissolved in liquid, split between morning and eveningthe same dosage as our Phase 2 clinical trial completed in 2009. Patients were randomized to the study treatment using a 2:1 ratio of L-glutamine to placebo. The randomization was stratified by investigational site and hydroxyurea usage. 
         The following charts summarize the results of this Phase 3 clinical trial.

  Primary EndpointReduction in the Frequency of Sickle Cell Crises 
         Analysis of the primary endpoint of the number of sickle cell crises through 48 weeks demonstrated a 25% reduction in the median frequency of sickle cell crises (median 3 vs. 4). We have reviewed the results further and on February 25, 2016 submitted a letter to the FDA advising them of the intent to submit an NDA in the summer of 2016. With this letter, additional statistical information on our primary endpoint was provided. Included in this information was an evaluation of the efficacy of our primary endpoint using the CMH test with modified ridit scores. The following chart shows the results using the CMH test statistic with different ranking methods sent to the FDA on February 25, 2016: 
      Sensitivity Analysis of Number of Sickle Cell Crises and Impact of Ranking Method 
   
 | CMH Statistical Method Used in Test(a) | 
Analysis | Modified Ridit | | Ridit | Table | Rank | 
Number of Sickle Cell Crises (p-value) | | 0.005 | | 0.005 | | 0.031 | 0.063


  (a)
p-values are from the CMH test with rank methods specified and controlling for hydroxyurea use and region. 


        In communications with the FDA in 2010, we indicated that the statistical method for calculation of the Phase 3 sample size estimate was done via the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and was intended to mimic as much as possible the CMH test to be used in the primary analysis. In the 2010 communication, we added that the stratified Wilcoxon rank-sum test may be carried out using the CMH test with modified ridit scores as part of our justification for using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for the sample size estimate. 
         In the Phase 3 statistical analysis plan a rank-type scoring procedure is mentioned; however, the ranking method was not specified. The results presented to the FDA, at two meetings held in 2014, 
 10

   utilized the ranking method of scores=rank. This method resulted in a p-value of 0.063 which was above the pre-specified p-value of 0.045 for this analysis. 
         As shown above, when the originally mentioned analytic method (CMH with modified ridit scores) that adjusts for varying strata size is utilized for the analysis of the primary endpoint, the results are highly statistically significant (p=0.005). 
   Secondary EndpointReduction in the Frequency of Hospitalization 
         We also assessed the effect of our prescription grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD by evaluating the frequency of hospitalizations for sickle cell pain as a secondary efficacy endpoint. The number of such hospitalizations, a key secondary endpoint, was significantly less, demonstrating a benefit from our prescription grade L-glutamine treatment as compared to placebo through Week 48 (a lower median number of hospitalizations of 2 vs. 3; p=0.005).

  Additional Analysis 
         Additional analyses were conducted to look at two key indicators which support the relevance of the efficacy findings. All such results demonstrated a benefit from our prescription grade L-glutamine treatment as compared to placebo:


 the median number of days before the first sickle cell crisis was longer in the L-glutamine group (87 days) compared to the placebo
group (54 days), a difference that was statistically significant (p=0.0152); and 
 the median number of days in hospital was shorter in the L-glutamine group (6.5 days) compared to the placebo group (11 days)
(p=0.022). 

         In addition, the severity of a patient's sickle cell crises was observed in our trial. The analyses of such data from the trial showed a statistically significant lower level in the severity of crises (p=0.0167). Further, the data from the trial showed a statistically significant reduction in the severity of reported ACS. 
         Another indication of the reduction in the frequency and severity of crises is the incidence of acute chest syndrome, or ACS, which was also part of the sickle cell crisis definition. In the study, the incidence of ACS, was found to be significantly lower with the L-glutamine treatment compared to the placebo group (26.9% of placebo patients compared to 11.9% of patients in the L-glutamine group) (p=0.0028). 
         Our trial results include imputation of values for patients who dropped out of the trial before reaching 48 weeks. In order to evaluate results without the imputation of values we have performed further sensitivity analyses which also showed a statistically significant lower number of sickle cell crises. 
         Regarding safety, adverse events, or AEs, were reported for 98% of patients in the L-glutamine group and 100% of the placebo group. Most AEs were mild or moderate (73.5% in the L-glutamine group, 83.4% in the placebo group). As expected in this disease population, the most common AE was sickle cell anemia with crisis, which was reported for 81.5% of patients in the L-glutamine group and 
 11

   91.0% of patients in the placebo group. Other notable differences between the treatment groups (difference of about 10 percentage points or more) all favored L-glutamine treatment and included acute chest syndrome (11.9% L-glutamine, 26.9% placebo). Patients in both groups had AEs that were considered possibly related to the study medication (21.2% L-glutamine, 15.4% placebo). The majority of the possibly related AEs were due to gastrointestinal disorders. 
         Serious adverse events, or SAEs, were reported for 78.1% of patients in the L-glutamine group and 87.2% of patients in the placebo group. The most common SAE was sickle cell crisis, which was reported in fewer patients treated with L-glutamine (67.5% L-glutamine, 80.8% placebo). 
         In summary our trial data indicates that our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment achieved:
 

 a 25% reduction in the median number of sickle cell crises; 
 a 33% reduction in the median number of sickle cell-related hospitalizations; 
 a 41% reduction in the median number of sickle cell-related cumulative hospital days; 
 a 63% lower reported incidence of sickle cell-related acute chest syndrome; 
 an increase in the median number of days before the first sickle cell crisis from 54 to 87 days; and 
 reported adverse events are similar between those treated with L-glutamine and placebo. 

   Regulatory Status of L-glutamine for SCD 
         Throughout the development process of the PGLG treatment for SCD, we have communicated with the FDA for guidance and advice. Required updates have also been made throughout the development process. 
         Emmaus' sickle cell disease therapy has Orphan Drug designation in the U.S. and Europe and Fast Track designation from the FDA. Emmaus also plans to submit a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency. 
         On September 7, 2016, we submitted the NDA to the FDA and were invited to an Application Orientation Meeting. The meeting was held at the FDA on October 27, 2016, and we received a positive reception at the meeting. On November 7, 2016, the NDA was deemed filed for review and on November 18, 2016, the FDA issued our "Day 74" letter with a PDUFA date of July 7, 2016. It was noted in the letter that any anticipated post-approval commitments would be communicated by June 9, 2017. The PGLG treatment represents the first potential treatment for pediatric patients with SCD, and the first potential new treatment in nearly 20 years for adult patients. 
         There can be no assurance that the FDA will find the information and data in the NDA, which consists largely of a single Phase 3 study and other supporting studies, sufficient to grant approval for the PGLG treatment. 
         Regarding the submission of NDAs that include only one Phase 3 clinical trial, the FDA has in some cases accepted evidence from one clinical trial to support a finding of substantial evidence of effectiveness. A change in the law under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, or Modernization Act, made clear that the FDA may consider data from only one adequate and well controlled clinical investigation and confirmatory evidence if the FDA determines that such evidence is sufficient to establish effectiveness of the medicine under study. 
         In a guidance document titled "Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products" (May 1998), the FDA stated that reliance on a single clinical trial is generally limited to situations in which a trial has demonstrated a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with a potential serious outcome, and where 
 12

   confirmation of the result in a second trial would be impractical or unethical. The factors the FDA considers for accepting a single clinical trial include, but are not limited to, having large multi centered studies, consistent data across subgroups, multiple endpoints, and statistically very persuasive findings. 
   Sales and Marketing Plans for our SCD Product Candidate 
         Subject to FDA approval of our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD, we intend to build a focused sales and marketing force of approximately 20 to 30 sales representatives to commercialize this product in the United States if we are not able to find a strategic partner on acceptable terms. We intend to focus our sales and marketing efforts across several different groups, including patients, physicians, health care providers, hospitals, treatment centers, insurance carriers, non-profit associations, and potentially, collaborating pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. Our in-house product specialists and sales representatives will focus on the following tasks as part of our marketing strategy:
 

 promote our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD to hematologist /oncologists and key opinion leaders in the area of sickle cell
disease; 
 starting with our 31 clinical trial sites, promote awareness of our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD at all U.S.
community-based treatment centers; 
 develop collateral materials and informational packets about our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD to educate patients and
physicians and garner industry support; 
 establish collaborative relationships with non-profit organizations and patient advocacy groups that focus on SCD; and 
 identify license partners and other international opportunities to commercialize our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD, if
approved by international regulatory authorities. 

 Currently Marketed Products 
         We currently market two L-glutamine-based products, NutreStore and AminoPure, in the United States and certain other territories. We generate limited revenues from the sale of these products, which we consider to be non-core operations. 
         NutreStore is our FDA-approved prescription L-glutamine powder for oral solution for the treatment of SBS in conjunction with an approved recombinant human growth hormone and other customary SBS management. Patients with SBS have had half or more of their small intestine surgically removed or have a poorly functioning small intestine due to inflammatory bowel disease. These patients cannot adequately absorb nutrition through their small intestine and thus require long-term intravenous nutrition, which is expensive, inconvenient, and poses significant infection risk. As cited in the NutreStore label, after four weeks of treatment with NutreStore, the patients enrolled in the Phase 3 trial showed:
 

 Reduced mean frequency of intravenous nutrition in days per week from 5.4 to 1.2; 
 Reduced mean intravenous nutritional volume in liters per week from 10.5 to 2.9; and 
 Reduced mean intravenous nutritional calories per week from 7,895 to 2,144. 

         NutreStore is distributed through local treating medical centers and physicians. We also provide the product to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Coast Guard and Public Health Service (Indian Health Service).

        AminoPure is our dietary supplement L-glutamine, sold through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Newfield Nutrition Corporation. AminoPure is currently sold in several U.S. states, and we export the product to Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. AminoPure is subject to regulation under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. 
   CellSeed Collaboration 
         In April 2011, we entered into a Research Agreement dated as of April 8, 2011 (the "Research Agreement") and an Individual Agreement dated as of April 8, 2011 (the "Individual Agreement") with the Japanese company CellSeed, Inc., or CellSeed, and, in August 2011, we entered into an addendum to the Research Agreement. Pursuant to the Individual Agreement, CellSeed granted us the exclusive right to manufacture, sell, market and distribute Cultured Autologous Oral Mucosal Epithelial Cell Sheet, or CAOMECS, for the treatment of corneal impairments in the United States. 
         On December 29, 2015, we and CellSeed terminated the Research Agreement and the Individual Agreement. As a result, we have no obligation to pay CellSeed any further amounts under these agreements, and we may not have an active license with respect to CellSeed's CAOMECS technology. There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate new license agreements with CellSeed, and if we are unable to do so, we may not be able to pursue the research and development of CAOMECS for the treatment of corneal diseases. 
         In June 2016, we entered into a non-exclusive agreement with CellSeed and Dr. Kohji Nishida for the development of CAOMECS technology under which we are required to pay single digit royalties based upon net sales. 
         A cell sheet is a composite of cells grown and harvested in an intact sheet, rather than as individual cells. These cell sheets can be used for tissue transplantation. CellSeed's technology involves culturing cells on a surface coated with a temperature-responsive polymer. The thinness of this polymer coating is measured at the nanometer scale. The cells cultured on this polymer can be harvested intact as a composite cell sheet. Using a patient's own oral mucosal cells, we are working toward being able to grow and harvest a cell sheet for directly transplanting onto the cornea of the patient's affected eye to repair the damaged cornea. 
         Our lead CAOMECS program is for treatment of corneal diseases. CAOMECS products are in preclinical development and have not been approved for marketing in the United States or any jurisdiction. The development of therapeutic products based on this cell sheet technology is in its early stages. We are not aware that cell sheets of the type that CellSeed and we are developing for treating corneal and other diseases are currently being used or sold by any third parties. The potential market for the corneal cell sheet products that CellSeed and we are developing includes patients with damaged corneas, which we believe represents a small percentage of the approximately 40,000 corneal transplants in the United States performed each year. The principal steps to development of a corneal cell sheet product include engaging a manufacturer compliant with applicable current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations and sufficient manufacturing capacity, conducting preclinical studies and human clinical trials, obtaining FDA approval of the product, training physicians who will use the product and perform procedures with the product and marketing the product. 
         Since 2011, an Emmaus-led team at LA BioMed has been conducting preclinical studies on corneal cell sheet technology. Subject to filing an investigational new drug application, or IND, that the FDA allows to become effective, we are preparing to begin our first clinical studies with human participants. We currently intend, if our clinical studies are successful, to file with the FDA a Biological License Application, or BLA, for this product. Based on the current status of our research and development efforts relating to this technology, we anticipate it will be six to seven years or longer before we would be able to submit and obtain FDA approval of a BLA that would allow us to begin to 
 14

   commercialize this product in the United States. If the product is approved for marketing, we plan to build a cGMP level facility as part of our U.S. commercialization plan for this technology. 
   Research and Development 
         We spent $2.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively, in 2016 and 2015 on research and development. None of these costs are borne or sponsored by our customers. 
   Raw Materials and Manufacturing 
         Our SCD treatment uses pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine. This differs from non-pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine available as a nutritional supplement. The manufacturing of large quantities of pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine is a complex and expensive undertaking, which we believe discourages entry of third parties into the market. As a result of these challenges, there are limited alternative suppliers from which we can obtain the pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine required to manufacture our current products and our SCD treatment product under development. 
         We currently obtain, and plan to continue to obtain, our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine from Ajinomoto North America, Inc., a subsidiary of Ajinomoto U.S.A. referred to as Ajinomoto, a Japanese food, amino acid and pharmaceutical company, and from Kyowa Hakko Bio Co., Ltd., a Japanese pharmaceutical company referred to as Kyowa. Ajinomoto and Kyowa together produce the majority of pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine approved for sale in the United States. 
         Ajinomoto has provided pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine to us free of charge for our clinical work, including our completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. Pursuant to a letter of intent between Emmaus Medical and Ajinomoto, we agreed to purchase or cause relevant third party purchasers to purchase from Ajinomoto all of the L-glutamine that we will need for our commercial products. Pursuant to the letter of intent, we will be permitted to source pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine from third party suppliers for up to 10% of our requirement for L-glutamine on a back-up basis. If, however, a competitor of Ajinomoto offers us more favorable price of L-glutamine of like grade with similar terms and conditions, we may respond to such offer in writing and request Ajinomoto to reconsider then-current price. We also currently source pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine from Kyowa for our NutreStore product. 
         Eventually we plan to seek to enter into exclusive long term supply contracts with these manufacturers for pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine for our SCD treatment that will require these companies to agree not to sell L-glutamine as a nutritional supplement or pharmaceutical for SCD applications. We do not currently have long term supply contracts with these manufacturers for L-glutamine or any other compound. As such, there is no assurance we will be able to obtain agreements for obtaining pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine from these proposed suppliers on terms acceptable to us, or on an exclusive basis, or that these suppliers will not experience an interruption in supply that could materially and adversely affect our business. 
         Our commercial products must be packaged by a facility that meets FDA requirements for cGMP. Packaging Coordinators, Inc., or PCI, of Rockville, Illinois, has handled the packaging for our Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials of our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD. If the pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD is approved, we intend to use the same company for commercial packaging of the product, if approved. PCI packaged L-glutamine for the clinical trials that resulted in the FDA's marketing approval for L-glutamine for SBS using the same dosage and packaging protocol as we expect to use for the treatment of SCD. Previous compliance with cGMP requirements for the packaging of pharmaceutical products, however, does not guarantee the ability to maintain cGMP compliance for the packaging of pharmaceutical products in the future.

     Facilities 
         We lease office space under operating leases from unrelated entities. The rent expense during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $589,769 and $492,919, respectively. 
         We lease approximately 13,329 square feet of office space for our headquarters in Torrance, California, at a base rental of $38,906 per month. The lease relating to this space expires on March 31, 2019. We lease an additional office suite in Torrance, California at a base rent of $2,240 per month for 1,600 square feet. The lease relating to this space will expire on January 31, 2020. 
         In addition, EM Japan leases 1,322 total square feet of office space in Tokyo, Japan. The leases relating to the space will expire on September 30, 2018. 
         We believe our existing facilities are adequate for our operations at this time and we expect to be able to renew the office lease for our headquarters on commercially reasonable terms. In the event we determine that we require additional space to accommodate expansion of our operations, we believe suitable facilities will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms as needed. 
   Employees 
         As of December 31, 2016, we had 25 employees, 16 of whom are full time, and we retained one consultant. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
 Competition 
         The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from both large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies (such as the National Institutes of Health) and public and private research institutions. In comparison to us, many of the entities against whom we are competing, or against whom we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
         Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in increasing concentration of resources among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our product development programs. 
         Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. The key competitive factors affecting the success of each of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their safety, efficacy, convenience, price, the level of proprietary and generic competition, and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer or more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, or are more convenient or less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in their establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.

     Sickle Cell Disease 
         Our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD is being developed as a therapy to reduce the frequency of sickle cell crisis in patients with SCD. The only approved drug targeting a reduction in the frequency of sickle cell crisis is hydroxyurea, which is available in both generic and branded formulations. While hydroxyurea has been shown to reduce the frequency of sickle cell crisis in some patient groups, it is not suitable for all patients because it can have significant toxicities and side effects. Additionally, hydroxyurea has not been approved by the FDA for pediatric use in SCD patients. 
         There is a high level of interest in SCD and we understand several academic centers and pharmaceutical companies are researching new treatments and therapies for SCD. There are studies underway testing different compounds that target various aspects of SCD pathophysiology. We are aware of two studies targeting the reduction or duration of vaso occlusive crisis events in patients with SCD which are currently in Phase 3 clinical trials sponsored by Global Blood Therapeutics and Pfizer. In addition, other companies or groups are working to obtain FDA approval for the use of hydroxyurea for pediatric patients. 
         We are also aware of efforts to develop cures for SCD through approaches such as bone marrow transplant and gene therapy. Although bone marrow transplant is currently available for SCD patients, its use is limited by the lack of availability of matched donors and by the risk of serious complications, including graft versus host disease and infection. Attempts to develop a cure through gene therapy remain at an early stage, but if these attempts were to succeed and receive regulatory approval, this could limit the market for a product such as our L-glutamine product candidate. 
         L-glutamine is marketed and sold without a prescription as a nutritional supplement. Although our L-glutamine treatment for SCD requires pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine, which we believe offers a more consistent quality and purity profile than non-pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine sold as a nutritional supplement, our L-glutamine product candidate for the treatment for SCD may compete with non-pharmaceutical grade alternative sources of L-glutamine. If our L-glutamine treatment for SCD is approved, we expect that it will be priced at a significant premium over non-prescription L-glutamine products. Furthermore, we face similar competition in respect of our own L-glutamine product marketed as a nutritional supplement. 
   Oral Mucosa Epithelial Cell Sheet 
         The development of regenerative medicine products using CAOMECS technology is in the early stages. Although there are many academic centers and biotechnology companies working on regenerative medicine in various fields, we are not aware of any treatments using cell sheet technology that have been approved by the FDA. We are, however, aware of academic centers and biotechnology companies that are researching stem cells in various forms, including in cell sheets, with potential applications for the treatment of limbal stem cell deficiency, or LSCD, a disease of the cornea. 
         For example, two academic centers outside the United States researching the transplantation of cells as a treatment for LSCD are the Centre Hospitalier National d'Ophtalmologie des Quinze-Vingts located in Paris, France, who we believe is conducting Phase 2 clinical trials evaluating the survivability of transplanted epithelium, and the Instituto Universitario de Oftalmobiología Aplicada located in Valladolid, Spain, who we believe has completed Phase 3 clinical trials looking at the viability and safety of mesenchymal stem cell transplants but the study results are not published. We are also aware of Holostem Terapie Avanzate, an Italian biotechnological company, who we believe is working with autologous cultures of limbal stem cells for corneal regeneration and restoration of visual acuity in patients with severe corneal chemical and thermal burns associated with total unilateral or severe bilateral LSCD. Holostem Terapie Avanzate has received conditional marketing approval from the European Commission for its therapy based on autologous stem cells for patients with severe cornea damage. 
 17

           Currently, the standard of care for LSCD patients is the treatment of symptoms. This treatment may include use of artificial tears, topical cyclosporine or topical steroids. In more advanced cases, the treatment plan will likely include surgery. The initial surgical interventions may include management of eyelid positioning, insertion of small plugs into the openings in the eye that allows tears to drain or partially sew the eyelids together to protect the cornea prior to considering transplantation of healthy limbal tissue using either cultured cells or whole tissue grafts. The source of the transplanted tissue can be from the patient's own cells from their healthy eye, matched living donors, or cadavers. Similar to other transplantations, there is the risk of serious complications, including graft versus host disease when not using the patient's own tissue. 
         In regenerative medicine and cell-based therapy, cell transplantation success not only depends on the cells, but also on the carrier/scaffold used, as it is not possible to graft separate cells in a suspension. Biodegradable polymers were the key technology for the first generation of cell therapy. Tremendous efforts have been made since to develop biofilms, acellular matrix (blood products e.g.; fibrin gel, amniotic membranes, etc.) to carry and deliver the cells to the target site. However, the risks of infection due to blood products or biomaterials cannot be completely denied. It has been repeatedly reported that decomposition of biodegradable transplanted scaffolds used for cell transplantations caused inflammation, foreign body reaction and cell damage. The use of an innovative temperature-responsive culture surface vessel technology eliminates these issues and, for the first time, offers the possibility to culture and engineer any type of cells to safely transplant cell-sheets to target organs for regenerative purpose, drug delivery, or tissue replacement. 
         This cell-sheet-based regenerative medicine technology is advanced, simple and has already shown dramatic results in pilot studies in Japan and Europe. An important feature of this novel and innovative cell sheet therapy is that harvested cell-sheets retain intact basal membranes and intact extracellular matrix (fibronectin, laminin, collagen type IV), eliminating the inherent risks of suture during transplantation. Another innovative feature this cell sheet therapy is that the construction of multiple layered cell sheets is made possible during the culture process and that cell sheet harvesting is achieved without harmful enzymes use (trypsin or dispase) that may damage the cell-based therapeutic potential. 
         This technology has the unique potential to construct in vitro stratified tissue equivalents by alternately layering different harvested cell sheets to provide regenerated tissue architectures. This novel technique thus holds promise for the study of cell-cell communications and angiogenesis in reconstructed, three-dimensional environments, as well as for tissues engineering with complex, multicellular architectures. 
   Government Regulation 
         In 2001, the FDA granted Orphan Drug designation to L-glutamine for the treatment of SCD. In 2005, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to our clinical study program of L-glutamine for treating SCD. The FDA also approved, in 2004, our NDA for our L-glutamine product for the treatment of SBS. In addition, in July 2012, the European Commission, or EC, granted Orphan Drug designation to L-glutamine for the treatment of SCD. We describe below the significance of these designations and of data exclusivity under the Hatch/Waxman Act. 
         Orphan Drug Designation.    The FDA has authority under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act to grant Orphan Drug designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition. This law defines a rare disease or condition generally as one that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of the development and distribution of the orphan product in the United States will be recovered from sales of the product. Being granted Orphan Drug designation provides tax benefits to mitigate expenses of developing the orphan product. More importantly, Orphan 
 18

   Drug designation provides seven years of market exclusivity if the product receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it was granted such designation and the indication for which approval is granted matches the indication for which Orphan Drug designation was granted. During the seven year exclusivity period, Orphan Drug exclusivity precludes FDA approval of a marketing application for the same product for the same indication. Orphan Drug exclusivity is limited and will not preclude the FDA from approving the same product for the same indication if the same product is shown to be clinically superior to the product previously granted exclusivity. For example, if the same product for the same indication is shown to have significantly fewer side effects, the FDA may approve the second product despite the Orphan Drug exclusivity granted to the first product. In addition, a product that is the same as the orphan product may receive approval for a different indication (whether orphan or not) during the exclusivity period of the orphan product. Also, Orphan Drug market exclusivity will not bar a different product intended to treat the same orphan disease or condition from obtaining its own Orphan Drug designation and Orphan Drug exclusivity. Orphan Drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits, which includes a 10-year Orphan Drug exclusivity period. 
         Fast Track Designation/Priority Review.    The FDA has authority under the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FD&C Act, to designate for "Fast Track" review new drugs and biologics that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to meet an unmet medical need for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. A product candidate that receives Fast Track designation is eligible for some or all of the following: more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support marketing approval; more frequent written correspondence from the FDA about the development of the product candidate; the ability, if agreed to by the FDA, to submit a NDA on a rolling basis; and, if certain criteria are met, eligibility for an FDA priority review designation, or Priority Review. These criteria for Priority Review include whether, if approved, the resulting product would provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions "cause"d by a disease when compared to standard treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of those conditions. Under Priority Review of a NDA, assuming that there are no requests from the FDA for additional information, the FDA's goal is to take action on the NDA within six months (compared to 10 months under standard review) after it is accepted for review, with the review clock starting at the time of submission. Requests for Priority Review of a NDA for the applicable product candidate must be submitted to the FDA when the NDA is submitted. 
  505(b)(2) Applications.    Under Section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act, a person may submit a NDA for which one or more of the clinical studies relied upon by the applicant for approval were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant does not have a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the clinical studies were conducted. Instead, a 505(b)(2) applicant may rely on published literature containing the specific information (e.g., clinical trials, animal studies) necessary to obtain approval of the application. The 505(b)(2) applicant may also rely on the FDA's finding of safety and/or effectiveness of a drug previously approved by the FDA when the applicant does not own or otherwise have the right to access the data in that previously approved application. The 505(b)(2) pathway to market thus allows an applicant to submit to the FDA a NDA without having to conduct its own studies to obtain data that are already documented in published reports or previously submitted NDAs. In addition to relying on safety data from our previously approved drug product, NutreStore, we intend to take advantage of the 505(b)(2) pathway to the extent published literature will further support our new drug marketing application. 
         Hatch/Waxman Data Exclusivity.    Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch/Waxman Act, a three-year period of data exclusivity is granted for a drug product that contains an active moiety that has been previously approved, when the application 
 19

   contains reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the sponsor that were essential to approval of the application. When granted to a sponsor, data exclusivity under the Hatch/Waxman Act prevents any third parties, such as generic drug manufacturers, from relying on or using the sponsor's data from the sponsor's new clinical investigations in order to obtain marketing approval for the same active moiety and indication for which the sponsor's NDA was approved. The FDA defines "new clinical investigation" as a "clinical study in humans the results of which have not been relied upon by FDA to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness of a previously approved drug product for any indication or of safety for a new patient population and do not duplicate the results of another investigation that was relied upon by the agency to demonstrate the effectiveness or safety in a new patient population of a previously approved drug product." Our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine drug product contains the same active moiety contained in our previously approved NutreStore drug product and we believe our Phase 3 clinical study meets the definition of a new clinical investigation for purposes of satisfying the requirements for Hatch/Waxman data exclusivity to be granted. Therefore, if approved, we anticipate receiving three years of data exclusivity under the Hatch/Waxman Act for our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD. These three years of data exclusivity would run concurrently with any other market exclusivity we may receive, as well as concurrently with any remaining patent term protection. However, the three-year exclusivity provided under the Hatch/Waxman Act would bar the approval of the same product for the same indication, even if the same product demonstrated clinical superiority. Thus, when running concurrently with Orphan Drug exclusivity, clinical superiority would not be sufficient to allow the FDA to approve a third party product during the first three years of Orphan Drug exclusivity. Similar to Orphan Drug exclusivity, the three-year exclusivity provided under Hatch/Waxman would not bar the FDA from approving another L-glutamine product for another indication, nor would it bar the FDA from approving a different active moiety to treat the same indication. 
         Regulation by United States and foreign governmental authorities is a significant factor in the development, manufacture and expected marketing of our product candidates and in our ongoing research and development activities. The nature and extent to which such regulation will apply to us will vary depending on the nature of the product candidates we seek to develop. 
         In particular, human therapeutic products, such as drugs, biologics and cell-based therapies, are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other preapproval requirements of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other countries. Various federal and state statutes and regulations govern and influence pre- and post-approval requirements related to research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution and record-keeping of such products to ensure the safety and effectiveness for their intended uses. The process of obtaining marketing approval and ensuring post-approval compliance with the FD&C Act for drugs and biologics (and applicable provisions of the Public Health Service Act for biologics), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other applicable federal and state statutes and regulations, requires substantial time and financial resources. Any failure by us or our collaborators to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, marketing approval could adversely affect the marketing of any of our product candidates, our ability to receive product revenues, and our liquidity and capital resources. 
         The manufacture of these products is subject to cGMP regulations. The FDA inspects manufacturing facilities for compliance with cGMP regulations before deciding whether to approve a product candidate for marketing. If the facility in which L-glutamine is manufactured is not ready for inspection at the time the FDA seeks to inspect it, or cGMP deficiencies are found upon such inspection, the FDA's approval of our NDA for our L-glutamine treatment for SCD could be delayed unless and until the facility is inspected and no deficiencies in need of correction prior to approval are identified or, if so identified, such deficiencies are corrected. 
 20

           The steps required by the FDA before a new product, such as a drug, biologic or cell-based therapy, may be marketed in the United States include:
 

 completion of preclinical studies (during this stage, the treatment is called a development candidate); 
 the submission to the FDA of a proposal for the design of a clinical trial program for studying in humans the safety and effectiveness of the
product candidate. This submission is referred to as an investigational new drug application, or IND. The FDA reviews the IND to ensure it adequately protects the safety and rights of trial
participants and that the design of the studies are adequate to permit an evaluation of the product candidate's safety and effectiveness. The IND becomes effective within thirty days after the FDA
receives the IND, unless the FDA notifies the sponsor that the investigations described in the IND are deficient and cannot begin; 
 the conduct of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, usually completed in three phases, to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of
the product candidate for its intended use; 
 the submission to the FDA of a marketing application, a NDA, if the product candidate is a drug, that provides data and other information to
demonstrate the product is safe and effective for its intended use, or a BLA, if the product candidate is a biologic that provides data and other information to demonstrate that the product candidate
is safe, pure, and potent; and 
 the review and approval of the NDA or BLA by the FDA before the product candidate may be distributed commercially as a product. 

         In addition to obtaining FDA approval for each product candidate before we can market it as a product, the manufacturing establishment from which we obtain it must be registered and is subject to periodic FDA post-approval inspections to ensure continued compliance with cGMP requirements. If, as a result of these inspections, the FDA determines that any equipment, facilities, laboratories, procedures or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and the conditions of the product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal, or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of the manufacturing operations, recalls, the withdrawal of approval and debarment. Manufacturers must expend substantial time, money and effort in the area of production, quality assurance and quality control to ensure compliance with these standards. 
         Preclinical testing includes laboratory evaluation of the safety of a product candidate and characterization of its formulation. Preclinical testing is subject to Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations. Preclinical testing results are submitted to the FDA as a part of an IND which must become effective prior to commencement of clinical trials. Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases following submission of an IND. In Phase 1, the product candidate under investigation (and therefore often called an investigational product) is initially administered to a small group of humans, either patients or healthy volunteers, primarily to test for safety (e.g., to identify any adverse effects), dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and clinical pharmacology, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. In Phase 2, a slightly larger sample of patients who have the condition or disease for which the investigational product is being studied receive the investigational product to assess the effectiveness of the investigational product, to determine dose tolerance and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects. If the data show the investigational product may be effective and has an acceptable safety profile in the targeted patient population, Phase 3 studies, also referred to as pivotal studies or enabling studies, are initiated to further establish clinical safety and provide substantial evidence of the effectiveness of the investigational product in a broader sample of the general patient population, to determine the overall risk-benefit ratio of the investigational product, and provide an adequate basis for physician and patient labeling. During all clinical studies, Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, standards and applicable human subject protection requirements must be 
 21

   followed. The results of the research and product development, manufacturing, preclinical studies, clinical studies, and related information are submitted in a NDA or BLA to the FDA. 
         The process of completing clinical testing and obtaining FDA approval for a new therapeutic product, such as a drug, biologic or cell-based product, is likely to take a number of years and require the expenditure of substantial resources. If a NDA or BLA is submitted, there can be no assurance that the FDA will file, review, and approve it. Even after initial FDA approval has been obtained, post-market studies could be required to provide additional data on safety or effectiveness. Additional pivotal studies would be required to support adding other indications to the labeling. Also, the FDA will require post-market reporting and could require specific surveillance or risk mitigation programs to monitor for known and unknown side effects of the product. Results of post-marketing programs could limit or expand the continued marketing of the product. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indication, manufacturing process, labeling, or the location of the manufacturing facility, a NDA or BLA supplement would generally be required to be submitted to the FDA prior to or corresponding with that change, or for minor changes in the periodic safety update report that must be submitted annually to the FDA. 
         The rate of completion of any clinical trial depends upon, among other factors, sufficient patient enrollment and retention. Patient enrollment is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial, the number of clinical sites, the availability of alternative therapies, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, and the eligibility and exclusion criteria for the trial. Delays in planned patient enrollment might result in increased costs and delays. Patient retention could be affected by patient non-compliance, adverse events, or any change in circumstances making the patient no longer eligible to remain in the trial. 
         Failure to adhere to regulatory requirements for the protection of human subjects, to ensure the integrity of data, other IND requirements, and GCP standards in conducting clinical trials could cause the FDA to place a "clinical hold" on one or more studies of a product candidate, which would stop the studies and delay or preclude further data collection necessary for product approval. Noncompliance with GCP standards would also have a negative impact on the FDA's evaluation of a NDA or BLA. If at any time the FDA finds that a serious question regarding data integrity has been raised due to the appearance of a wrongful act, such as fraud, bribery or gross negligence, the FDA may invoke its Application Integrity Policy, or AIP, under which it could immediately suspend review of any pending NDA or BLA or refuse to accept the submission of a NDA or BLA as filed, require the sponsor to validate data, require additional clinical studies, disapprove a pending NDA or BLA or withdraw approval of marketed products, as well as require corrective and preventive action to ensure data integrity in future submissions. Significant noncompliance with IND regulations could result in the FDA not only refusing to accept a NDA or BLA as filed but could also result in enforcement actions, including civil and administrative actions, civil money penalties, criminal prosecution, criminal fines and debarment. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by regulatory authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. 
         The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product approvals vary widely from country to country, and the time required for approval might be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Although there are some procedures for unified filings for some European countries, in general, each country at this time has its own procedures and requirements. 
         In most cases, if the FDA has not approved a product candidate for sale in the United States, the unapproved product may be exported to any country in the world for clinical trial or sale if it meets U.S. export requirements and has marketing authorization in any listed country without submitting an export request to the FDA or receiving FDA approval to export the product, as long as the product meets the regulatory requirements of the country to which the product is being exported. Listed 
 22

   countries include each member nation in the European Union or the European Economic Area, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Israel, Switzerland and South Africa. If an unapproved product is not approved in one of the listed countries, the unapproved product may be exported directly to an unlisted country if the product meets the requirements of the regulatory authority of that country, and the FDA determines that the foreign country has statutory or regulatory requirements similar or equivalent to the United States. 
         In addition to the regulatory framework for product approvals, we and our collaborative partners must comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding occupational safety, laboratory practices, the use, handling and disposition of radioactive materials, environmental protection and hazardous substance control, and other local, state, federal and foreign regulation. All facilities and manufacturing processes used by third parties to produce our product candidates for clinical use in the United States and our products for commercialization must be in compliance with cGMP requirements and are subject to periodic regulatory inspections. The failure of third party manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could extend, delay or cause the termination of clinical trials conducted for our product candidates or the withdrawal of our products from the market. The impact of government regulation upon us cannot be predicted and could be material and adverse. We cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation that might result from future legislation or administrative action. 
         With respect to our L-glutamine product candidate for the treatment of SCD, we have completed preclinical studies, submitted an IND to the FDA which has become effective and conducted Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. We submitted a NDA to the FDA in September 2016 and a PDUFA date was set for July 7, 2017, at which time we expect to know whether the FDA has approved the PGLG treatment for SCD. 
         After reviewing the NDA, the FDA will make a determination as to whether data and other information demonstrate the safety and provide substantial evidence of effectiveness of the product candidate for its intended use(s), which includes an analysis of whether its benefits outweigh its risks; whether its proposed labeling is adequate and complete; and whether the methods used in, and the facilities or controls used for, its manufacture, processing, packing and storage conform to and are operated or administered in conformity with cGMP regulations. Upon completion of the NDA review, the FDA will either approve or not approve the application, or issue a Complete Response Letter (a letter from the FDA indicating that it cannot approve the application in its present form and informing the applicant of changes that should be made before the application could be approved). If the FDA approves the NDA, we will be able to commercialize the product. If the FDA does not approve our NDA, we will not be able to commercialize our SCD product candidate, which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition. 
         If the FDA issues a Complete Response Letter, the FDA would be required to provide the basis for its decision and we would have an opportunity to meet with FDA officials to discuss any deficiencies noted in the letter. At that point, we could choose to request a hearing and appeal the agency's decision, or address deficiencies and, if necessary, submit additional data or information, or withdraw the application. Common problems which may delay or prevent the FDA from approving a NDA include, but are not limited to, unexpected safety issues, inadequate data analysis, or the failure, in the FDA's judgment, to provide substantial evidence of a product candidate's effectiveness. If we receive a Complete Response Letter, we may need to conduct additional studies, perhaps studies of more people or, different types of people, or conduct studies for a longer period of time. If we must conduct additional clinical studies in order to address any deficiencies identified in a Complete Response Letter, we may not have sufficient funding to conduct such additional trials or studies. 
         Outside the United States, we sell AminoPure in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. There are no regulatory requirements to sell AminoPure in Japan because it is classified as a nutritional supplement 
 23

   product. To sell AminoPure in Taiwan, we are required to obtain a Certificate of Free Sale from the FDA, which we provide to our distributor. The FDA issues a Certificate of Free Sale upon request for products that either meet the applicable requirements of the FD&C Act and may be legally marketed in the United States or may be legally exported under the FD&C Act although they may not be legally marketed in the United States. Once the Certificate of Free Sale is furnished to our distributor in Taiwan, it is the distributor's responsibility to comply with local regulations, including but not limited to, obtaining the proper import license. In South Korea, AminoPure is imported and sold as a dietary supplement, which does not require any regulatory approval but is subject to dietary supplement cGMP regulations. In Ghana, AminoPure is a registered product with the Food and Drug Board of the Ministry of Health. 
   Patents, Proprietary Rights and Know-How 
         Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and otherwise preserve the intellectual property rights relating to the design, operation, sale and distribution of our products. We intend to seek patents on our products when we deem it commercially appropriate. The process of seeking patent protection can be lengthy and expensive, and there can be no assurance that patents will be issued for currently pending or future applications or that our existing patents or any new patents issued will be of sufficient scope or strength or provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us. We may be subject to, or may initiate, litigation or patent office interference proceedings, which may require significant financial and management resources. The failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or the advent of litigation arising out of any such intellectual property claims could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
         We have relied to date on a combination of patent licenses, trademark and trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights and to maintain and enhance our competitiveness in the pharmaceutical industry. While we do not currently own any issued patents, we have two patent licenses with third parties. We have also submitted patent applications which have yet to be published. If our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD is approved by the FDA, we will seek seven years of Orphan Drug market exclusivity based on the FDA's previous grant to us of Orphan Drug designation for this product candidate. 
         We also rely on unpatented technologies to protect the proprietary nature of our products. We require that our officers and key employees enter into confidentiality agreements that require these officers and employees to assign to us the rights to any inventions developed by them during the course of their employment with us. All of the confidentiality agreements include non-solicitation provisions that remain effective during the course of employment and for periods following termination of employment. 
   Patents 
         On December 13, 2016, Emmaus announced the allowance covering the use of its lead investigative product, pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine (PGLG), directed to the treatment of diverticulosis by the Japanese Patent Office and the issuance of corresponding patents in both Australia and China. 
         On February 1, 2017, Emmaus announced the allowance by the US Patent & Trade Office of a patent covering the use of its lead investigative product, pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine (PGLG), for the treatment of diverticulosis. Related patent applications are currently pending in various jurisdictions around the world, including the Europe, South Korea, Brazil, Russia, India, Mexico and Indonesia. 
 24



        Diverticulosis refers to a condition where pouches (i.e., diverticula) form along the colon wall. Over time, some people get an infection in the pouches, diverticulitis, which usually requires hospitalization. Epidemiological studies indicate that the prevalence of this disease is increasing worldwide. It is estimated that at least 50% of the population over the age of 60 in the United States, Europe and Australia have diverticulosis. In Japan, a recent study found diverticulosis in 20% of the investigated population (approximate mean age 68 years). 
         On February 7, 2017, Emmaus announced the allowance of a patent by the Japanese Patent Office for the use of its lead investigative product, pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine (PGLG), for the treatment of diabetes. A related patent application is currently pending in the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions. 
         The allowed Japanese application reports a significant reduction of HbA1C levels, one of the best indicators of whether diabetics and pre-diabetics have blood sugar levels under control, through therapeutic application of L-glutamine. 
         The covered invention is directed to compositions for decreasing HbA1C levels in individuals who are shown to have average blood sugar levels in the diabetic range. Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas is no longer able to make insulin, or when the body cannot make good use of the insulin it produces. People with diabetes have an increased risk of developing a number of serious health problems including cardiovascular disease, kidney failure and blindness. Japan has more than 7 million diagnosed cases of diabetes, which represents about 7.6% of Japanese between the ages of 20 and 79. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are an estimated 29 million Americans living with diabetes and an estimated 86 million Americans with prediabetes, a serious health condition that can increase a person's risk of developing type 2 diabetes. 
   Licenses and Promotional Rights Agreements 
         On March 1, 2001, Emmaus Medical became the exclusive worldwide licensee under U.S. Patent No. 5,693,671, entitled "L-glutamine Therapy for SCD and Thalassemia" issued on December 2, 1997 to Niihara et al., which we refer to as the SCD Patent, to develop a treatment approach for SCD and thalassemia using L-glutamine pursuant to a license agreement. Our Chief Executive Officer is one of the licensors of the SCD Patent. Pursuant to the license agreement and an addendum to the license agreement between us and Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, or LA BioMed, we acquired the exclusive right to test, gain governmental approval of, make, have made, use, distribute and sell products designed for use in carrying out methods covered under the SCD Patent, which we refer to as the Licensed Methods, and/or incorporating technical information provided by the licensor or by any of certain doctors affiliated with the licensor, which we refer to as the Licensed Products. The license agreement and addendum terminated upon the expiration of the SCD Patent in May 2016. Such termination extended to any royalty payments due under the agreement. However, we may consider a new agreement to recognize LA BioMed's contribution to SCD research. 
         Although the SCD patent is expired, we will continue to seek market exclusivity protection for the SCD treatment by way of our orphan designation which, if the product is approved, will grant us seven years market exclusivity. In addition, under the Title I of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Resolution Act or the Hatch/Waxman Act, we may be eligible for three year period market exclusivity if approved by the FDA. The FDA may not agree that our product is entitled to data exclusivity under the Hatch/Waxman Act and, if granted, data exclusivity protection under the Hatch/Waxman Act will expire three years after our product is approved. 
         In October 2007, under a sublicense granted by CATO Research Ltd., or CATO, Emmaus Medical became the exclusive sublicensee of US Patent No. 5,288,703, which we refer to as the SBS Patent, for the U.S. market, including the rights to distribute the L-glutamine treatment for SBS under the 
 25

   trademark NutreStore in the United States, which we refer to as the SBS License. CATO granted Emmaus Medical the SBS License under a sublicense that CATO held from Ares Trading S.A. We commercially launched NutreStore in June 2008. In February 2011, we entered into an assignment and transfer agreement with CATO. Under this agreement, CATO assigned and transferred to us ownership of the NutreStore NDA, Drug Master Files, or DMFs, No. 16633 and 16639, NutreStore-related trademarks, and the know-how represented by the NutreStore NDA and DMFs. The two DMFs contain the proprietary information relating to the manufacturing and packaging specifications of the NutreStore product. In consideration of this assignment and transfer, we agreed to pay to CATO royalties following the expiration of the SBS License on October 7, 2011, when the SBS Patent expired, in the following amounts: 10% of adjusted gross sales of NutreStore from 2012 through 2016; and 1% of gross sales of L-glutamine as a treatment for SCD and thalassemia for a period of five years from the date of first commercial sale of the treatment. We do not anticipate that the expiration of the SBS License will have a significant impact on us and we intend to sell NutreStore in accordance with the terms of the assignment and transfer agreement. We currently do not believe there should be significant competition in the marketplace for a generic version of NutreStore given the small population of SBS patients (<10,000 adults). 
         In April 2011, we entered into the Research Agreement and the Individual Agreement with CellSeed and, in August 2011, entered into an addendum to the Research Agreement. Pursuant to the Individual Agreement, CellSeed granted us the exclusive right to manufacture, sell, market and distribute CAOMECS for the cornea in the United States. 
         On December 29, 2015, we and CellSeed terminated the Research Agreement and the Individual Agreement. As a result, we have no obligation to pay CellSeed any further amounts under these agreements, and we may not have an active license with respect to CellSeed's CAOMECS technology. There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate new license agreements with CellSeed, and if we are unable to do so, we may not pursue the research and development of CAOMECS for the treatment of corneal diseases. 
         In June 2016, we entered into a non-exclusive agreement with CellSeed and Dr. Kohji Nishida for the development of CAOMECS technology. Under this license agreement, we are required to pay royalties upon commercialization. The royalties to be paid are based on net sales per annum.

The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report or in any other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. 
   Proposed Generex Transaction 
         As previously reported, on January 16, 2017 the Company entered into a letter of intent ("LOI") with Generex Biotechnology Corporation ("Generex") which contemplates that Generex will acquire a controlling interest in the Company for a total consideration of $225,000,000, payable $10,000,000 in cash and $215,000,000 in shares of Generex's common stock, which are referred to as the "Generex shares." The Generex shares are to be valued for this purpose at $3.80 per share, subject to adjustment in certain events. 
         Under the LOI, Generex paid the Company $500,000 as a deposit for an initial cash consideration and was to pay the Company another deposit of $1,500,000 by February 6, 2017. On February 6, 2017, the Company granted Generex an extension of the payment date to February 16, 2017 and, by a letter amendment dated February 16, 2017, the Company granted Generex another extension of the payment date to February 24, 2017 and otherwise amended the LOI. 
         On March 3, 2017, Generex and the Company further amended the LOI to provide as follows:
 

 Generex agreed to pay the Company an additional deposit of $500,000 on or prior to March 6, 2017, which the Company has received. 
 Within ten trading days after March 14, 2017, the date of effectiveness of a reverse stock split of Generex common stock, Generex must
pay the Company another deposit of $3,000,000, which the Company has received. 

 27

   

 The parties will use their best efforts to negotiate and sign a definitive purchase agreement no later than March 30, 2017. 
 The remaining $6,000,000 of the cash consideration will be paid to the Company at the closing under a definitive purchase agreement, which is
to occur no later than five trading days after the date Generex amends its certificate of incorporation to effect an increase in its authorized capital, but no later than May 1, 2017. 
 The closing of the proposed acquisition by Generex is to occur no later than May 8, 2017. 
 If a definitive purchase agreement is not executed or the closing does not occur by the required deadlines, and the LOI is terminated by either
party, the Company will refund and return to Generex all deposits within 60 days after the termination. 

         In consideration for the foregoing waivers, extensions and amendments, Generex has agreed to issue to the Company 24,414,063 of restricted shares of Generex common stock within three trading days after Generex effects the planned increase in its authorized capital. 
         The parties' respective obligations under the LOI to consummate the proposed acquisition are subject to a number of conditions, including completion of due diligence to each party's satisfaction parties and the negotiation and execution of a definitive purchase agreement, and there is no assurance these conditions will be satisfied. Any definitive purchase agreement also would contain customary conditions to closing, which may or may not be satisfied or waived by the parties. 
         Although the Company has no present intention to terminate the LOI or to abandon the proposed acquisition, the Company may choose to do so if the conditions to the proposed acquisition have not been satisfied by the required deadlines, unless such deadlines are extended. If one or more of the conditions are not satisfied, the Company may decide to abandon the proposed acquisition if the Company's board of directors determines that it is in the best interests of the Company to do so. 
         For all of the foregoing reasons, there is no assurance that the proposed acquisition by Generex and the payment to the Company of the cash consideration and the Generex shares will be completed on time, or at all, and the discussions in the Annual Report assume that the proposed acquisition will not be completed. If the proposed acquisition by Generex is completed, the Company's capitalization, the risks related to the Company's common stock and other information in the Annual Report would change materially from the descriptions in this Annual Report. 
   Other Possible Transactions 
         From time to time in the ordinary course of business, the Company engages in informal or formal discussions, and may enter into non-binding or binding letters of intent, with prospective investors and other companies regarding possible investments in the Company such as the mutual co-investments between the Company and KPM Tech Co., Ltd. and Hanil Vacuum Co., Ltd. completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company currently is engaged in discussions, and have entered into a non-binding letter of intent, with another company regarding possible co-investments by the companies. 
         Such discussions and letters of intent are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and may not lead to definitive agreements regarding a possible transaction. There can be no assurance, therefore, whether any such transaction will be undertaken or completed or, if undertaken and completed, on what terms.
