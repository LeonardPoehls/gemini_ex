ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate History and Overview
 
We are an energy services holding company. We provide an array of energy services through our subsidiary companies, E3 and TPC. We provide solutions that enable customers to reduce their energy consumption, lower their operating and maintenance costs, and realize environmental benefits. Our comprehensive set of services includes competitive electricity plans and upgrades to a facility’s energy infrastructure.
 
We were incorporated in Nevada on October 18, 1971 under the name of Mr. Nevada, Inc., and following the completion of a limited public offering in April 1972, we commenced limited operations which were discontinued in 1990. Thereafter and through 2012, we reorganized and, on several occasions, sought to merge with or acquire certain active private companies or operations, all of which were terminated or resulted in discontinued negotiations. We have been organized as a holding company that provides financial and management expertise, which includes access to capital, financing, legal, insurance, mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and management strategies to our subsidiaries. Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets Group Inc. QB tier (“OTCQB”), under the symbol “PRHL”.
 
In August of 2012, we acquired a unique marquee technology for energy efficient lighting, the E-Series controller developed by Active ES. This patented technology provides an upgrade for existing HID lamps for high-bay indoor and outdoor applications. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company performed additional research and development to the products from Active ES adding two new products for mass production, the 480-volt version of the controller, suitable for ports and other large facilities, and a 240-volt version of the LiteOwl for Streetlights, vastly increasing the applicable market.
 
In the first quarter of 2013, we acquired an 80% stake in TPC, a deregulated power broker in Illinois. The clients of TPC have commercial/industrial facilities such as small businesses, warehouses and distribution centers, which are candidates for E3’s products and services.
 
Presently, we provide an array of energy services through E3 and TPC. The Company provides solutions that enable customers to reduce their energy consumption, lower their operating and maintenance costs, and realize environmental benefits. Our comprehensive set of services includes competitive electricity plans and upgrades to a facility’s energy infrastructure.
 
In addition to organic growth, we expect that strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses and assets will remain an important part of our growth plan to enable us to broaden our service offerings and expand our geographical reach.
 
Overview of Industry
 
We bridge two industries in the Energy field: TPC is engaged in the deregulated energy space (reselling power from suppliers, and also as a supplier) and E3 is engaged in providing energy efficiency technologies. Deregulated power is expected to be one of the largest markets since the deregulation of telecom, only much larger. Energy efficiency companies, sometimes referred to as energy services companies, or ESCOs, develop, install and arrange financing for projects designed to improve the energy efficiency of client facilities. Typical products and services offered by energy efficiency companies include lighting and lighting retrofits, HVAC upgrades, motor controls, equipment installations, load management, and can include power generation including on-site cogeneration, renewable energy plants, etc. As we grow, we expect to be involved in all of these opportunities. Energy efficiency companies often offer their products and services through energy savings performance contracts, or ESPCs. Under these contracts, energy efficiency companies assume certain responsibilities for the performance of the installed measures, under assumed conditions, for a portion of the project’s economic lifetime.
 
There are a number of industry factors that affect our ESCO business which include the overall demand for LED lighting. Future growth depends significantly on the adoption of LED lighting. The market for LED lighting has grown in recent years, as acceptance of LEDs for general lighting increases, but it still faces significant challenges before widespread adoption. This indicates the large untapped potential market, and as these challenges are successfully addressed it could signal increased sales opportunities. Demand also fluctuates based on various market cycles, a continuously evolving LED industry supply chain and demand dynamics in the market. These uncertainties make demand difficult to forecast. The competitive environment in the LED lighting industry is intense. Traditional lighting companies and new entrants are investing in LED lighting products as LED adoption has gained momentum. Product pricing pressures exist as market participants often undertake pricing strategies to gain or protect market share. To remain competitive, resellers of LED lighting must continuously increase service and support, product performance (including a degree of product independence to be free to move to other manufacturers with better products), and reduce costs.

E3’s Business
 
E3 is an Energy Services Company (ESCO) formed by the Company to provide the best-of-breed energy reduction solutions for its clients. Through surveys and various analysis, E3 prescribes the best solution for the unique circumstance of each client by providing the most current, fully-vetted solutions in energy reduction technologies, as well as management tools which capture the client for future opportunities.
 
Many companies only provide stand-alone solutions and only address one area of energy efficiency. E3 looks at its clients’ entire energy footprint and develops custom solutions that fit their distinct requirements. E3 prescribes the most appropriate solutions for its clients’ facilities and operations based on their budget. In addition, E3 facilitates the entire process from assessment of needs to planning and implementation to ensure that all expectations for energy reduction and technology performance are met.
 
E3 lowers the cost of energy through competitive supplier bidding and creates comprehensive energy savings solutions through the implementation of energy reduction projects. The mission of E3 is to help a customer select and implement the most cost-effective energy conservation measures for its facilities. E3’s energy services division is focused on providing business customers with best-in-class demand management solutions such as lighting (LED), HVAC, Commercial Refrigeration and Water Sub-Metering.
 
The sales, design and implementation process for energy efficiency projects can take from several months to several years. Existing and potential customers generally follow extended budgeting and procurement processes and sometimes must engage in regulatory approval processes. This extended sales process requires the dedication of significant time by sales and management personnel of the Company and the use of significant financial resources, with no certainty of success or recovery of related expenses.
 
TPC’s Business
 
TPC provides competitive energy pricing delivered with no change in services provided by a customer’s local utility provider. There are currently 16 states that have deregulated their electrical energy markets. While many consumers have already benefitted from deregulated energy, there are millions more that have not taken advantage of this opportunity. It is estimated that federally requested energy deregulation will be enacted in some form in more of the 50 states by 2020. The deregulation industry is estimated at 7 to 11 times larger than when the telecom industry deregulated. Today and as this market broadens, the Company expects TPC to continue to leverage its strength in these emerging markets.
 
Prior to deregulation, the utility market in each state was monopolized. One utility provided all components of energy services: supply and distribution. In 1992, Congress passed the National Energy Policy Act, allowing consumers in deregulated states the power to choose their energy supplier. TPC is an experienced energy consulting firm in the deregulation space that utilizes its market standing and its large, well-established network of energy suppliers to compete for its clients’ business. With no cost to, or obligation by its clients, TPC serves as its clients’ energy advocate and negotiates the most competitive pricing and options for its clientele. Because of TPC’s buying power, market expertise, and strong and diverse supplier relationships, TPC can achieve results and cost savings that are greater than most individuals and/or organizations can obtain on their own.
 
TPC’s business model is to enlist commercial and residential clients who benefit from the law passed allowing for competition in the energy markets as a result of deregulation of energy. In many cases TPC saves its clients 10% to 30% on their energy bills by simply switching suppliers, all while the enrollee still receives services from their local utility (the local utility continues to distribute the power, read the meter, bill, and service any interruptions). TPC is different than several of its competitors in that TPC has agreements with multiple energy suppliers allowing TPC to leverage its standing in the marketplace to garner competitive pricing for its clients by having its suppliers compete for its clients’ business. Currently, TPC has access to multiple suppliers and has most of the agreements in place that allow for TPC to be paid for the life of the client’s tenure with the supplier. TPC acquires its clients through strategic partnerships, trained in-house commercial and door-to-door residential agents and call centers.

TPC utilizes its online client energy portal, which is a sophisticated energy portal enabling rapid, efficient and secure sales transactions of deregulated power. The energy portal is designed to enable sales agents, whether from a computer terminal, a smart phone, or any web browser to access the pertinent information on a prospective client. Agents can view their clients’ energy profiles and quickly access the energy options available to them. The transparency and ease of the energy portal allows TPC’s agents to select the best power provider for their customers and process the paperwork online in real-time, which enables client acquisition in minutes. This sales portal enables large-scale, rapid sales of deregulated power. The energy portal is built for scalability so that it can be monetized on its own, meaning it can be offered to any deregulated power company as a sales tool. The technology also provides sales management, reporting, verification, and compliance tracking which may be among the best in the industry.
 
Strategy and Outlook
 
As of the date of this report, our current strategy involves the following initiatives:
 

· | Expanding activities in deregulated energy markets through strategic partners: TPC continues to focus on building sales channels through strategic partners that either have, or have access to significant customers to which we can offer competitive electricity rates.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Creating and leveraging sales leads from TPC’s deregulated sales efforts to drive sales opportunities: As TPC continues to build its commercial and business customer base, it informs these customers that, in addition to financial savings that they can achieve through the negotiation of more competitive electricity rates, E3 can also provide energy savings through the installation of lighting and other building envelope technologies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Focusing on building channel sales partners for E3: We have established strategic partners in key growth markets that advocate and introduce our lighting and related demand management technologies to TPC customer base. We intend to continue to build and develop these channel partnerships both domestically and internationally.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Plan to become a power provider/supplier: By adding a power provider/supplier in the future, we can book the entire energy bill as revenue as opposed to only the commission. This revenue is estimated to provide two to three times the earnings on the same customer currently being acquired by TPC, by picking up the margin between the wholesale and retail price.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | One-stop shop for “everything energy”: We believe that we can best serve our customers by providing all energy related products and services under one cohesive and coordinated package, with over 30 energy supplier partnerships, and plans to operate also as a supplier, and with E3 representing an expanding array of products, some proprietary, which enables us to provide the most appropriate and effective solution to meet our customers’ needs and financial objectives.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marketing
 
Our sales and marketing strategy captures the unique opportunity of being in two closely related, but separate industries. Through TPC, we reach consumers for deregulated power. A portion of these (the commercial/industrial customers) will also be candidates for E3’s business. TPC, as it becomes integrated with E3, will provide E3 with the ability to cross market its product line to TPC’s already existing client base. This provides an advantage over the competition by offering a complete clean energy solution package of a much lower cost of power and, by the use of its energy efficiency products, the reduction of energy consumption.
 
In addition to these valuable clients from TPC, the company’s strategy is to approach large and qualified prospects through a network of resellers and alliance partners with pre-existing relationships and/or top-tier reputations in their respective markets (as well as direct sales as described below), and to offer their clientele customized and comprehensive energy efficiency solutions tailored to meet their economic, operational and efficiency goals.
 
Throughout the industry, the evaluation, proposal, sales, and implementation process for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects can typically take from three to 36 months or longer, due to the prescriptive nature of a consultative sale. Sales to state and federal governmental and housing authority customers tend to require the longest lead time. E3 identifies direct-sales opportunities through the pre-existing relationships of its team, as well as referrals, requests for proposals, conferences, web searches, telemarketing and additional product/service sales to existing customers.

E3 also supports its network of resellers with a wide range of energy efficiency products through its alliance with suppliers. E3 not only provides products at a very competitive rate, but supports its resellers through training, marketing material, team sales visits, and a sales support infrastructure that can reduce the typical sales cycle time.
 
Lead qualification has been automated such that a prospect can be evaluated over the phone, reducing the expense of performing audits and surveys on unqualified prospects. As the business develops we expect the audits will be performed by qualified sales engineers, typically LEED certified (Leaders in Energy Efficiency Design, a program under the US Department of Energy’s Green Building Council) and/or certified electricians, which results in a more comprehensive, professional, accurate and competitive proposal. The Company and its resellers utilize trained and certified electricians and engineers to perform the installation, further increasing customer satisfaction. Follow-up reports verify energy savings performance. The Company also has access to third-party funding options which can meet the unique financial requirement of the client, including no-money down, and immediately cash-flow-positive programs.
 
Sustainability and Efficiency Market Potential
 
Management believes that the market for energy efficiency will continue to grow, that we will increase penetration in this market, and that revenue will continue to increase over time. Continued fiscal uncertainty has and may continue to contribute to a lengthening of our sales cycle for both municipal and commercial customers.
 
Due to the long and variable selling cycle for E3 business, the sales, design and implementation process for energy efficiency projects can take from several months to 36 months. Existing and potential customers generally follow extended budgeting and procurement processes, and sometimes must engage in regulatory approval processes. This extended sales process requires the dedication of significant time by sales and management personnel and the use of significant financial resources, with no certainty of success or recovery of related expenses. All of these factors can contribute to fluctuations in quarterly financial performance and increase the likelihood that operating results in any particular quarter may fall below investor expectations.
 
Competition
 
The ESCO market in the United States is viable and growing due to many driving factors in the current economy. The United States government has recently pushed towards energy conservation and efficiency which has led to substantial market growth in this industry. We are in competition with other more established companies that may be better capitalized and have more established name recognition than we do. There is no assurance that we can compete successfully in this marketplace.
 
For the LED Lighting industry, competitors include other resellers, ESCO’s, distributors, as well as manufacturers who sell direct or through agents. These manufacturers include Cree, Sylvania, Phillips, GE, as well as many specialty manufacturers. Resellers of LED lamps abound in the industry both small and large and are usually categorized by their geographic or vertical segmentation, or their specialty (i.e. residential, commercial/industrial, rebate-driven, ornamental, etc.). In addition, providers of other services may also sell LED lamps, such as big box stores, electricians, solar or energy efficiency businesses.
 
TPC sells power provided by energy suppliers, who may also sell directly. As a result, energy suppliers are both an ally and a potential competitor. Those competing suppliers are allies in that TPC garners its clients by contracting consumers with those same energy suppliers. When TPC presents a client/prospect to one or more of its contracted energy suppliers, that prospect/client is listed and protected as TPC's introduction and client. An example of this "cooperation" is embodied in the largest energy retailer in North America which has over 6 million customers. They are technically TPC's competition because clients can sign up with this supplier without the assistance of TPC. However, TPC generates a substantial portion of its overall revenue by signing on new monthly clients and selling this supplier's many energy offerings. In turn, this supplier counts on TPC’s volume of business.
 
Many of TPC’s competitors contract with these same suppliers to sell their energy offerings. There are approximately 50 licensed suppliers in Illinois that range from Constellation Energy, which is owned by Exelon, that generates approximately $30 Billion in revenue annually to suppliers such as Agera Energy, LLC with whom TPC has had a sales agreement since their launch. Other competitors include, but are not limited to, AEP Energy, Champion Energy, LLC, ConEdison Solutions, Eligo Energy IL, LLC, Entrust Energy, Green Mountain Energy Company, IDT Energy, Inc., Kona Energy, Liberty Power Holdings LLC, MC Squared Energy Services, LLC, MidAmerican Energy, NextEra Energy Services Illinois, LLC, Nordic Energy Services, Plymouth Rock Energy, LLC and Santanna Energy Services.

Government Regulation
 
E3
 
Various regulations affect the conduct of our business. The applicable regulatory requirements differ in each state and between agencies of the federal government. Our projects must conform to all applicable electric reliability, building and safety, and environmental regulations and codes, which vary from place to place and time to time. Various federal, state, provincial and local permits are required to construct an energy efficiency project or a renewable energy plant.
 
Some of the energy demand reduction services that we provide for utilities and institutional clients are subject to regulatory tariffs imposed under federal and state utility laws. In addition, the operation of, and electrical interconnection for, our renewable energy projects are subject to federal, state or provincial interconnection and federal reliability standards also set forth in utility tariffs. These tariffs specify rules, business practices and economic terms to which we are subject. The tariffs are drafted by the utilities and approved by the utilities’ state, provincial or federal regulatory commissions.
 
Individual states may have regulations to protect the environment such as Title 24 in California and New York, which address upgrading existing buildings and the specifications for new construction. The manufacturers of LED lights and other equipment must abide by government regulation. We take appropriate steps to ensure the products we sell comply with those regulations and industry standards such as EnergyStar, Lighting Facts and Design Lighting Council.
 
TPC
 
We are subject to government regulations at both the state and federal levels, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) and individual states’ Public Utilities Commission (“PUC”) for a substantial level of rates and services that we provide. The FERC regulates certain activities of public utilities. The scope of the jurisdiction of the FERC under the FPA encompasses review and approval of (i) rates charged by public utilities for wholesale sales of electricity; (ii) issuances of securities and assumption of liabilities by public utilities; (iii) interstate transmission of electricity; (iv) certain dispositions of assets; and (v) interlocking directorships between public utilities and certain interested parties. The various state PUC’s will regulate the rates that can be charged for such services or distributions, ancillary services and other retail power services, and will determine the terms under which we can compete with the investor owned utilities and other energy service providers. There is no certain assurance that the regulations promulgated by FERC and/or state PUCs will act to our benefit.
