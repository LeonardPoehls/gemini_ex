ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
CONE Midstream Partners LP (the “Partnership”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) is a master limited partnership formed in May 2014 by CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE: CNX) (“CONSOL”) and Noble Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NBL) (“Noble Energy”), whom we refer to collectively as our Sponsors, primarily to own, operate, develop and acquire natural gas gathering and other midstream energy assets to service our Sponsors’ production in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Our assets include natural gas gathering pipelines and compression and dehydration facilities, as well as condensate gathering, collection, separation and stabilization facilities. We currently generate all of our revenues under long-term, fixed-fee gathering agreements with each of our Sponsors that are intended to mitigate our direct commodity price exposure and enhance the stability of our cash flows. The gathering agreements with our Sponsors currently include acreage dedications of approximately 515,000 aggregate net acres, subject to the release provisions set forth therein. Although our Sponsors currently account for all our revenues, we seek to supplement our profitability and future growth by pursuing opportunities to perform gathering services for unrelated third parties in the future. In addition, we also consider accretive acquisitions, which may include drop downs of additional interests in our existing consolidated assets.

Since July 1, 2011, our Sponsors have drilled 537 gross horizontal wells in our Marcellus Shale dedication area, which contributed to average combined daily gross wellhead production of approximately 1,354 BBtu/d in 2016. As of December 31, 2016, there were 73 wells that remained uncompleted, and our Sponsors estimate they have approximately 3,700 combined potential new drilling locations on our Marcellus Shale dedicated acreage. Please read “Our Acreage Dedication” beginning on page 10. Our Sponsors believe that their existing contractual commitments for Marcellus Shale processing capacity and long-haul firm transportation will help minimize disruptions to their drilling and development plans that might otherwise exist as a result of insufficient outlets for growing production.

The following charts illustrate our Sponsors’ production trends and the number of combined wells they have drilled with respect to our dedicated acreage for the periods indicated:

(1) Represents gross wellhead production attributable to wells drilled on our dedicated acreage.
(2) Represents total gross wells turned in line on our dedicated acreage. As of December 31, 2016, there were 73 gross horizontal wells that have been drilled but are not yet completed.
About Us
On September 30, 2014, we closed our initial public offering (“IPO” or “offering”) of 20,125,000 common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership at a price to the public of $22.00 per unit. Our common units are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CNNX.” The Partnership's general partner is CONE Midstream GP LLC (“general partner”), a wholly owned subsidiary of CONE Gathering LLC (“CONE Gathering”), which is a joint venture formed by our Sponsors in September 2011. CONE Gathering represents our predecessor for accounting purposes (the “Predecessor”). References in our consolidated financial statements to “the Partnership,” “our partnership,” “we,” “our,” “us” or like terms, when used for periods prior to the IPO, refer to CONE Gathering. References in our consolidated financial statements to “the Partnership,” “our partnership,” “we,” “our,” “us” or like terms, when used for periods beginning at or following the IPO, refer collectively to CONE Midstream Partners LP and its consolidated subsidiaries. For periods prior to the 
5

IPO, our consolidated financial statements and related notes include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of CONE Gathering.
In connection with the completion of our IPO, our Sponsors, through CONE Gathering, contributed to us a 75% controlling interest in our Anchor Systems, a 5% controlling interest in our Growth Systems and a 5% controlling interest in our Additional Systems. Effective November 16, 2016, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 25% noncontrolling interest in our Anchor Systems from CONE Gathering in exchange for cash consideration of $140.0 million, the issuance of 5,183,154 common units and a general partner interest in the amount necessary for our general partner to maintain its two percent general partner interest in us, which brought our controlling ownership in this system to 100%. For a description of each of our systems, see “Our Midstream Assets” below.
Our Midstream Assets
In order to effectively manage our business we have divided our current midstream assets among three separate segments that we refer to as our “Anchor Systems,” “Growth Systems” and “Additional Systems” based on their relative current cash flows, growth profiles, capital expenditure requirements and stages of their development.

• | Our Anchor Systems include our most developed midstream systems that generate the largest portion of our current cash flows, which includes our three primary midstream systems (the McQuay System, the Majorsville System and the Mamont System) and related assets.


• | Our Growth Systems are primarily located in the dry gas regions of our dedicated acreage that are generally in earlier phases of development and require substantial future expansion capital expenditures to materially increase production, which would primarily be funded by our Sponsors in proportion to CONE Gathering's 95% retained ownership interest.


• | Our Additional Systems include several gathering systems primarily located in the wet gas regions of our dedicated acreage that we expect will require lower levels of expansion capital investment relative to our Growth Systems. The substantial majority of capital investment on these systems would primarily be funded by our Sponsors in proportion to CONE Gathering's 95% retained ownership interest.

In order to maintain operational flexibility, our operations are conducted through, and our operating assets are owned by, our operating subsidiaries. However, neither we nor our operating subsidiaries have any employees. Our general partner has the sole responsibility for providing the personnel necessary to conduct our operations, whether through directly hiring employees or by obtaining the services of personnel employed by our Sponsors or others. All of the personnel that conduct our business are employed or contracted by our general partner and its affiliates, including our Sponsors, but we sometimes refer to these individuals as our employees because they provide services directly to us.

Gathering Assets
As of December 31, 2016, our gathering assets comprised a network of 254 miles of gathering pipelines with an average daily throughput of approximately 1,354 BBtu/d. 
The following table provides information regarding our gathering assets as of and, with respect to average daily throughput, for the year ended December 31, 2016:
 
System | Our Ownership Interest | Gas Type | Pipelines (in miles) | Average Daily Throughput (BBtu/d) | Maximum Interconnect Capacity(1)(2) (BBtu/d) | Compression (horsepower)
Anchor Systems | 100% | Dry/Wet | 175 | 1,100 | 1,429 | 75,150 
Growth Systems | 5% | Dry/Wet | 31 | 69 | 860 | 6,700 
Additional Systems | 5% | Dry/Wet | 48 | 185 | 545 | 9,480 

(1) Maximum interconnect capacity is the maximum throughput that can be delivered from the system through physical interconnections to third-party facilities or pipelines.
(2) Our midstream systems currently have interconnects with the following interstate pipelines: Columbia Gas Transmission, Texas Eastern Transmission and Dominion Transmission, Inc.
Compression and Dehydration Facilities
We operated 17 facilities to provide our compression and/or dehydration services as of December 31, 2016, the capacities of which are summarized in the following table:

System | Our Ownership Interest | Compression (horsepower) | Compression Capacity (BBtu/d)
Anchor Systems | 100% | 75,150 | 1,230 
Growth Systems | 5% | 6,700 | 80 
Additional Systems | 5% | 9,480 | 160 

Condensate Handling Facilities
Our assets include two condensate handling facilities - in Majorsville, Pennsylvania (Anchor Systems) and Moundsville, West Virginia (Additional Systems) - that provide condensate gathering, collection, separation and stabilization services. Each facility has nominal handling capacities of 2,500 Bbl/d. 
Our Relationship with Our Sponsors and CONE Gathering
One of our principal strengths is our relationship with our Sponsors and CONE Gathering. 
CONSOL is a Pittsburgh-based integrated energy company with a focus on natural gas exploration and production, as well as coal production. CONSOL's natural gas operations are focused on the major shale formations of the Appalachian Basin, including the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale. CONSOL deploys an organic growth strategy focused on developing its resource base. CONSOL’s coal operations, which are also in the Appalachian Basin, consist of mining, preparation and marketing of thermal coal primarily to power generators. CONSOL is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “CNX”.
Noble Energy is a global independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company with a diverse resource base. In addition to its operations in the Marcellus Shale, Noble Energy has positions in three other premier unconventional U.S. onshore plays: the Denver-Julesburg Basin in Colorado; the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas; and the Delaware Basin in West Texas. In addition to these onshore plays, Noble Energy also holds positions in three premier conventional offshore plays: the U.S. Gulf of Mexico; the Eastern Mediterranean; and in West Africa. Noble Energy is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “NBL”.
CONSOL and Noble Energy each own a 50% interest in CONE Gathering, which owns our general partner as well as noncontrolling limited partner interests in two of our operating subsidiaries. Through our ownership of all of the outstanding 
9

general partner interests in our operating subsidiaries, the Partnership has voting control over, and the exclusive right to manage, the day-to-day operations, business and affairs of our midstream systems. CONE Gathering retained noncontrolling interests in our operating subsidiaries that are subject to our right of first offer. Following our purchase of the remaining 25% noncontrolling interest in the Anchor Systems, which include our most developed systems, we now own a 100% controlling interest in the Anchor Systems. CONE Gathering’s continued ownership of a 95% noncontrolling interest in each of the Growth Systems and the Additional Systems allows us to integrate the development and operation of these systems into our existing operations while allowing our Sponsors, through their ownership of CONE Gathering, to bear responsibility for funding the substantial majority of the initial development of these systems, thereby reducing our share of capital expenditures and borrowings associated with expansion of these systems in the short term. 
CONE Gathering’s retention of ownership interests in the Growth Systems and the Additional Systems, combined with our right of first offer on those interests, may provide opportunities for us to grow our distributable cash flow through a series of acquisitions of these retained interests over time. However, CONE Gathering is under no obligation to offer to sell us any assets (including our right of first offer assets, unless and until it otherwise intends to dispose of such assets), and we are under no obligation to buy any assets from CONE Gathering. In addition, we do not know when or if CONE Gathering will make any offers to sell assets to us. Please read “Right of First Offer Assets” beginning on page 13.
Dissolution of Our Sponsors’ Upstream Joint Venture
On September 30, 2011, CONSOL and Noble Energy entered into a Joint Development Agreement (“JDA”) and related ancillary agreements governing their joint exploration and development of their combined acreage in the Marcellus Shale, which comprised an area of mutual interest (“AMI”) that covered portions of 28 counties in West Virginia and 19 counties in Pennsylvania and included over 26,000 square miles (the "Co-Owned Properties"). Pursuant to the JDA, each of our Sponsors owned an undivided 50% working interest in the jointly owned Marcellus Shale acreage, and under the JDA, any other oil and natural gas interests covering the Marcellus Shale within the AMI that became jointly owned by CONSOL and Noble Energy would have automatically become part of the upstream acreage.  In addition, prior to September 2036, both CONSOL and Noble Energy were required to offer the other party the right to participate in any acquisition of oil and natural gas interests within the AMI that covered at least the Marcellus Shale. To provide for the coordinated drilling and development of this upstream acreage, the JDA covered, among other things, our Sponsors’ obligations as operators of their respective areas, the allocation of costs between our Sponsors, an area of mutual interest and the establishment of a drilling and development program. The JDA provided that CONSOL would operate and develop the eastern, or the dry gas, portion of the upstream acreage, and Noble Energy would operate and develop the western, or the wet gas, portion of the upstream acreage.
On December 1, 2016, our Sponsors consummated an Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), pursuant to which, effective as of October 1, 2016, the JDA was terminated and CONSOL and Noble Energy separated their Marcellus Shale AMI into two separate operating areas.  Under the Exchange Agreement, CNX Gas Company LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of CONSOL (“CNX Gas”), and Noble Energy exchanged certain jointly owned oil and gas properties and related assets that were previously subject to the JDA. Among other things, under the Exchange Agreement, CNX Gas transferred its interests in certain of the Co-Owned Properties to Noble Energy, and Noble Energy transferred its interests in the remaining Co-Owned Properties to CNX Gas. Following consummation of the Exchange Agreement, each of CNX Gas and Noble Energy now owns 100% of their respective upstream interests in the Marcellus Shale. 
To support the growth of their respective upstream interests in the Marcellus Shale, our Sponsors have invested over $850.0 million in our midstream assets since September 2011, which includes their portion of spending as a limited partner in the Partnership. In addition, each of our Sponsors maintains freshwater infrastructure and systems that distribute freshwater from regional water sources for its well completion operations in the Marcellus Shale. These systems consist of a combination of permanent buried pipelines, portable surface pipelines and freshwater storage facilities, as well as pumping stations to transport the freshwater throughout the pipeline networks. We believe that our Sponsors' existing long-term contractual commitments for Marcellus Shale processing capacity and long-haul firm transportation will help minimize disruptions to their drilling and development plans that might otherwise exist as a result of insufficient outlets for growing production.
Our Acreage Dedication 
As of December 31, 2016, our existing dedicated acreage covered approximately 515,000 aggregate net acres, subject to the release provisions set forth in our gas gathering agreements. Our Sponsors have drilled 537 gross horizontal wells, of which 73 remain uncompleted, on such acreage since January 1, 2011, and had approximately 3,700 combined potential new drilling locations on such acreage at December 31, 2016. Improvements in drilling and completion technology are allowing fewer wells to be drilled on the same footprint while rendering greater resource potential as compared to our Sponsors' estimates at the time of our IPO. Accordingly, our Sponsors now determine potential drilling locations in the Marcellus Shale based on the assumption that each well is drilled with a 7,000 foot lateral within a 120-acre spacing unit (as opposed to a 5,000 foot 
10

lateral/86-acre assumption at the time of the IPO). In order to determine the number of drilling locations at December 31, 2016, our Sponsors divided the total net acres in our dedicated acreage by the number of acres in each spacing unit (120 acres). The number of, and timing with respect to, the potential locations that each of our Sponsors may drill will depend on numerous factors (some of which are beyond their control), including anticipated lateral length, geologic conditions and economic factors.
Our gathering agreements with CNX Gas and Noble Energy (each as described below) also provide that, in addition to our existing dedicated acreage, any future acreage covering the Marcellus Shale formation that is acquired by CNX Gas or Noble Energy, respectively, in an area that covers over 7,700 square miles in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, which we refer to as the “dedication area,” and that is not subject to a pre-existing third-party commitment will automatically be dedicated to us for natural gas midstream services, subject to the release provisions set forth in each agreement. Prior to terminating their upstream joint venture, our Sponsors made several key acquisitions in the dedication area which increased our existing dedicated acreage. For example, prior to the Exchange Agreement, our Sponsors entered into farmout agreements for approximately 88,000 contiguous net acres in the Central West Virginia area and acquired approximately 9,000 contiguous net acres in the Pittsburgh International Airport area, all of which have been dedicated to us.
In addition to our existing dedication acreage and any potential future dedicated acreage, we have also been granted rights of first offer ("ROFO") by each of CNX Gas and Noble Energy to provide midstream services on their respective ROFO acreage, which currently includes approximately 186,000 aggregate net acres of CNX Gas’ and Noble Energy’s combined existing Marcellus Shale acreage that is not currently dedicated to us, along with any future acreage covering the Marcellus Shale formation that is acquired by CNX Gas or Noble Energy, as applicable, in an area that covers over 18,300 square miles in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, which we refer to as the “ROFO area,” and that is not subject to a pre-existing third-party commitment.
Our Gathering Agreements
Upon consummation of the Exchange Agreement, we entered into new fixed-fee gathering agreements with each of CNX Gas and Noble Energy that replaced the gathering agreements that had been in place since the IPO. In addition to incorporating changes related to the Sponsors' termination of their upstream joint venture and JDA, the new gathering agreements provide more clarity on each Sponsor's acreage dedication to the Partnership and related releases and allow each Sponsor to independently advance its own development program. We also anticipate that the new gathering agreements will simplify the decision making process relating to the Partnership's ability to gather third party gas. 
Under the new gathering agreements, the fees we receive for gathering services (which are outlined below), will generally remain the same as under the prior gathering agreements, and our Sponsors will continue to dedicate all of their existing Marcellus Shale acres in the dedication area to us for natural gas midstream services and to dedicate their existing Marcellus Shale acreage in the Moundsville area (Marshall County, West Virginia), the Pittsburgh International Airport area and the Majorsville area (Marshall County, West Virginia and Greene and Washington Counties, Pennsylvania) to us for condensate gathering and handling services. In addition, our Sponsors will continue to dedicate certain coal bed methane wells, certain horizontal wells drilled in the Upper Devonian formation and the acreage associated with such wells to us for natural gas midstream services. All such dedications remain subject to the release provisions set forth in each gas gathering agreement, as described below.
Under the gathering agreements that were in place from the date of the IPO through November 30, 2016, we received a fee based on the type and scope of the midstream services we provided, summarized as follows:

• | For the services we provided with respect to natural gas that did not require downstream processing, or dry gas, we received a fee of $0.41 per MMBtu in 2016.


• | For the services we provided with respect to the natural gas that required downstream processing, or wet gas, we received a fee of $0.282 per MMBtu in the Moundsville (Marshall County, West Virginia) and Pittsburgh International Airport areas and $0.564 per MMBtu for all other areas in the dedication area in 2016.


• | For condensate services we received a fee of $5.125 per Bbl in the Majorsville area and $2.563 per Bbl in the Moundsville area in 2016.

Under the new gathering agreements, which became effective as of December 1, 2016, we continue to receive a fee based on the type and scope of the midstream services we provide, summarized as follows:

• | For the services we provide with respect to natural gas from the Marcellus Shale formation that does not require downstream processing, or dry gas, we will receive a fee of $0.42 per MMBtu in 2017.


• | For the services we provide with respect to the natural gas that requires downstream processing, or wet gas, we will receive:

11


◦ | a fee of $0.289 per MMBtu in 2017 in the Moundsville area (Marshall County, West Virginia);


◦ | a fee of $0.289 per MMBtu in 2017 in the Pittsburgh International Airport area; and


◦ | a fee of $0.578 per MMBtu in 2017 for all other areas in the dedication area.


• | For the services we provide to each of our Sponsors with respect to natural gas from the Utica Shale formation, we will receive a weighted average rate of $0.22 per MMBtu in 2017, which is consistent with the fees charged to date.


• | For 2017, our fee for condensate services will be $5.25 per Bbl in the Majorsville area and $2.627 per Bbl in the Moundsville area.

Under the new gathering agreements, each of the foregoing fees will escalate by 2.5% on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 2018. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from time to time, each of our Sponsors may request rate reductions under certain circumstances, which are reviewed by the board of directors of our general partner, with oversight, as our board of directors deems necessary, by our conflicts committee. No rate reduction arrangements are currently active.
Under the new gathering agreements, we will continue to gather, compress, dehydrate and deliver all of our Sponsors’ dedicated natural gas in the Marcellus Shale on a first-priority basis and to gather, inject, stabilize and store all of our Sponsors’ dedicated condensate on a first-priority basis, with the exception of the following:

• | until December 1, 2018, CNX Gas will receive first-priority service in our Majorsville system with respect to a certain volume of production (revised bi-annually) and any excess production will receive second-priority service; and


• | until December 1, 2018, Noble Energy will receive first-priority service in our McQuay system with respect to a certain volume of production (revised bi-annually) and any excess production will receive second-priority service.

Each of our Sponsors provides us with quarterly updates on its drilling and development operations, which include detailed descriptions of the drilling plans, production details and well locations for the following 24 months and a three to ten year plan that includes more general development plans. In addition, we regularly meet with our Sponsors to discuss our current plans to timely construct the necessary facilities to be able to provide midstream services to them on our dedicated acreage. In the event that we do not perform our obligations under a gathering agreement, CNX Gas or Noble Energy, as applicable, will be entitled to certain rights and procedural remedies thereunder, including the temporary and/or permanent release from dedication discussed below and indemnification from us.
In addition to the natural gas and condensate that is produced from the dedicated acreage, each of our Sponsors may elect to dedicate non-Marcellus Shale properties located in the dedication area to us in which the Sponsor has an interest. If a Sponsor elects to dedicate any such property, then that Sponsor will propose a fee for the associated midstream services we would provide. So long as the proposed fee generates a rate of return consistent with the Sponsor’s existing gathering agreement on both incremental capital and operating expense associated with any expenditures necessary to gather gas from such property, any midstream services that we agree to provide will be on a second priority basis; second only to the first priority basis afforded to each of our Sponsors on their respective dedicated production. Throughput that we currently gather from Utica Shale wells operated by either one of our Sponsors is addressed in the new gathering agreements. 
Our gathering agreements provide that if we fail to timely complete the construction of the facilities necessary to provide midstream services to a Sponsor's dedicated acreage or have an uncured default of any of our material obligations that has caused an interruption in our services to a Sponsor for more than 90 days, the affected acreage will be permanently released from our dedication. Also, after the third anniversary of each gathering agreement (December 1, 2019), if CNX Gas or Noble Energy, as applicable, drills a well that is located more than a certain distance from a connection to our current gathering system (and is not to be serviced by our gathering systems as reflected in the then-existing gathering system plan) and a third-party gatherer offers a lower cost of service, and such Sponsor elects to utilize the third-party gatherer, then the acreage associated with such well will be permanently released from our dedication. Any permanent releases of our Sponsors’ acreage from our dedication could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make cash distributions.
Our gathering agreements also provide that in certain situations, such as an uncured default of any of our material obligations under the gathering agreement for more than 45 days but less than 90 days, our dedicated acreage can be temporarily released from our dedication. In addition, if we interrupt or curtail the receipt of a Sponsor's gas under certain conditions for a period of five consecutive days or more than seven days within any consecutive two week period, then the applicable Sponsor can temporarily release from the dedication under its gathering agreement the affected volumes for a period lasting until the first day of the month following 30 days after our notice to the Sponsor that the interruption or curtailment has ended. Although there have not been any such instances to date, any temporary releases of acreage from our dedication could 
12

materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make cash distributions.
While our gathering agreements run with the land and, subject to the exceptions described therein, are binding upon the transferee of any of our dedicated acreage, the agreements provide that each of our Sponsors may divest up to 25,000 net acres of its dedicated acreage (plus or minus the net of acreage acquired or divested within the dedicated area since our IPO) free of the dedication to us. The amount of net acreage that may be divested by each Sponsor free of the dedication will be increased by the amount, if any, of the net acreage acquired (or deemed to be acquired) by such Sponsor in the dedication area that will become automatically dedicated to us. For purposes of determining if acreage can be released free and clear of the dedications under our gathering agreements, the actual net acreage divested or acquired may be adjusted upwards or downwards based on the geographic location of such net acreage, the timing of the respective divestiture or acquisition and certain other conditions in the gas gathering agreements. There are no restrictions under our gathering agreements on a Sponsor’s ability to transfer acreage in the ROFO area, and any transfer of a Sponsor’s acreage in the ROFO area will not be subject to our right of first offer.
Upon completion of its initial term in 2034, each of our gathering agreements will continue in effect from year to year until such time as the agreement is terminated by either us or the Sponsor party to such agreement on or before 180 days prior written notice.
Right of First Offer Assets
In addition to the initial assets that our Sponsors, through CONE Gathering, contributed to us in connection with our IPO, CONE Gathering has granted us a right of first offer:

• | to acquire (i) CONE Gathering’s retained interests in our Growth Systems and Additional Systems, (ii) CONE Gathering’s other ancillary midstream assets and (iii) any additional midstream assets that CONE Gathering develops, before CONE Gathering sells any of those interests to any third party during the ten-year period following the completion of the IPO (the “right of first offer period”); and


• | to provide midstream services to each of our Sponsors on its portion of our ROFO acreage, which currently includes approximately 186,000 aggregate net acres of CNX Gas’ and Noble Energy’s combined existing Marcellus Shale acreage that is not currently dedicated to us, as well as any future acreage that is acquired by CNX Gas or Noble Energy, respectively, in its portion of the ROFO area and that is not subject to a pre-existing third-party commitment.

CONE Gathering is under no obligation to offer to sell us any assets (including our right of first offer assets, unless and until it otherwise intends to dispose of such assets), and we are under no obligation to buy any assets from CONE Gathering. In addition, we do not know when or if CONE Gathering will make any offers to sell assets to us. While we believe our rights of first offer are significant positive attributes, they may also be sources of conflicts of interest. CONE Gathering owns our general partner, and there is substantial overlap between of the officers and directors of our general partner and the officers and directors of our Sponsors. Please read “Risk Factors — Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us.”
Third-Party Services and Commitments
Our Sponsors have entered into agreements that impact the scope of certain services we provide and the fees we charge under our gathering agreements. Although we provide all field gathering in the following areas, we do not provide compression, dehydration and condensate stabilization services with respect to (i) approximately 3,500 net acres in the Moundsville area (Marshall County, West Virginia) and (ii) approximately 9,000 net acres in the Pittsburgh International Airport area (Allegheny County, Pennsylvania). With respect to these areas, our Sponsors have contracted with third parties for the provision of such services. Accordingly, we charge our Sponsors a reduced fee for the services we provide with respect to all natural gas and condensate produced from these areas. 
Title to Our Properties
Our real property interests are acquired pursuant to easements, rights-of-way, permits, surface use agreements, deeds or licenses from landowners, lessors, easement holders, governmental authorities, or other parties controlling surface estate (collectively, “surface agreements”). These surface agreements allow us to use such land for our operations. Thus, the real estate interests on which our pipelines and facilities are located are held by us as grantee, and the party who owns or controls the surface lands, as grantor. We have acquired these surface agreements without any material challenge known to us relating to the title to the land upon which the assets are located, and we believe that we have satisfactory rights and interests to conduct our operations on such lands. We have no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying title of any material surface agreements 
13

held by us or to our title to any material surface agreements, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material surface agreements.
Some of the surface agreements that were transferred to us from CONE Gathering required the consent of the grantor or other holder of such rights. CONE Gathering obtained sufficient third-party consents and authorizations and provided notices required for the transfer of the assets necessary to enable us to operate our business in all material respects. With respect to any remaining consents, authorizations or notices that have not been obtained or provided, we have determined these will not have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business should the Partnership or CONE Gathering fail to obtain or provide such consents, authorizations or notices in a reasonable time frame.
Under our omnibus agreement, CONE Gathering will indemnify us for any failure to have certain surface agreements necessary to own and operate our assets in substantially the same manner that they were owned and operated prior to the IPO. CONE Gathering’s indemnification obligation is limited to losses for which we notify CONE Gathering prior to the third anniversary of the closing of the IPO and is subject to a $0.5 million aggregate deductible before we are entitled to indemnification.
Seasonality
Demand for natural gas generally decreases during the spring and fall months and increases during the summer and winter months. However, seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or mild summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. These seasonal anomalies can increase demand for natural gas during the summer and winter months and decrease demand for natural gas during the spring and fall months. With respect to our completed midstream systems, we do not expect seasonal conditions to have a material impact on our throughput volumes. Severe or prolonged winters may, however, impact our ability to complete additional well connections or complete construction projects, which may impact the rate of our growth. In addition, severe winter weather may also impact or delay the execution of our Sponsors' drilling and development plans.
Competition
As a result of our relationship with the Sponsors, we do not compete for the portion of the existing operations of each of our Sponsor's upstream operations for which we currently provide midstream services, and other than with respect to acreage that may be released, subject to the terms of our gas gathering agreements, we will not compete for future portions of their upstream operations that are dedicated to us pursuant to our gathering agreements. Please read “Our Gathering Agreements.” Nonetheless, our Sponsors have entered into agreements with third parties for the provision of certain midstream services. Please read “Third-Party Services and Commitments.” In addition, we face competition in attracting third-party volumes to our midstream systems, and these third parties may develop their own midstream systems in lieu of employing our assets.
Regulation of Operations
Regulation of pipeline gathering services may affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our services.
Natural Gas Gathering Pipeline Regulation
Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act ("NGA") exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") under the NGA. Although FERC has not made any formal determinations with respect to any of our facilities we consider to be gathering facilities, we believe that the natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish that a natural gas pipeline is a gathering pipeline not subject to FERC NGA jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and FERC determines whether facilities are gas gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of some our gas gathering facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts, or Congress. If FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility is not a gas gathering pipeline and the pipeline provides interstate service, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by FERC under the NGA and/or the Natural Gas Policy Act ("NGPA"). Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA or NGPA, this could result in the imposition of administrative and criminal remedies and civil penalties, as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the rate established by FERC.
14

State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities and intrastate transportation pipelines generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. States in which we operate may adopt ratable take and common purchaser statutes, which would require our gathering pipelines to take natural gas without undue discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another similarly situated source of supply. The regulations under these statutes may have the effect of imposing some restrictions on our ability as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to gather natural gas. States in which we operate may also adopt a complaint-based regulation of natural gas gathering activities, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to gathering access and rate discrimination. We cannot predict whether such regulation will be adopted and whether such a complaint will be filed against us in the future. Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies. To date, our midstream systems have not been adversely affected by recent state regulations.
Our gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to more stringent application of state regulation of rates and services. Our gathering operations also may be or become subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of gathering facilities. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on our operations, but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.
Pipeline Safety Regulation
Some of our natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA") pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, ("NGPSA"), as amended by the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 ("PSA"), the Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act of 1996 ("APSA"), the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 ("PSIA"), the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 ("PIPES Act"), and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the "2011 Pipeline Safety Act"). The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of natural gas pipeline facilities, while the PSIA establishes mandatory inspections for all U.S. oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in high-consequence areas ("HCAs").
PHMSA has developed regulations that require pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in HCAs. The regulations require operators, including us, to:

• | perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;


• | identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a HCA;


• | improve data collection, integration and analysis;


• | repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and


• | implement preventive and mitigating actions.

The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act reauthorized funding for federal pipeline safety programs, increased penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines, and required studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, among other things, increased the maximum civil penalty for pipeline safety violations and directed the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate rules or standards relating to expanded integrity management requirements, automatic or remote-controlled valve use, excess flow valve use, leak detection system installation and testing to confirm the material strength of pipe operating above 30% of specified minimum yield strength in HCAs. Effective October 25, 2013, PHMSA adopted new rules increasing the maximum administrative civil penalties for violation of the pipeline safety laws and regulations after January 3, 2012 to $200,000 per violation per day, with a maximum of $2,000,000 for a related series of violations. In addition, PHMSA has published advanced notice of proposed rulemakings to solicit comments on the need for changes to its natural gas and liquid pipeline safety regulations, including whether to extend the integrity management program requirements to gathering lines. In October 2015, PHMSA proposed changes to its hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations that would significantly extend the integrity management requirements to previously exempt pipelines and would impose additional obligations on hazardous liquid pipeline operators that are already subject to the integrity management requirements. PHMSA’s proposed rule would also require annual reporting of safety-related conditions and incident reports for all hazardous liquid gathering lines and gravity lines, including pipelines that are currently exempt from PHMSA regulations. PHMSA issued a separate regulatory proposal in July 2015 that would impose pipeline incident prevention and 
15

response measures on natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline operators. PHMSA also issued an advisory bulletin providing guidance on the verification of records related to pipeline maximum allowable operating pressure.
The National Transportation Safety Board has recommended that PHMSA make a number of changes to its rules, including removing an exemption from most safety inspections for natural gas pipelines installed before 1970. While we cannot predict the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives, such legislative and regulatory changes could have a material effect on our operations, particularly by extending more stringent and comprehensive safety regulations (such as integrity management requirements) to pipelines and gathering lines not previously subject to such requirements. While we expect any legislative or regulatory changes to allow us time to become compliant with new requirements, costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on our operations.
States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate lines but most are certified by the Department of Transportation, or DOT, to assume responsibility for enforcing federal intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. States may adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate lines; however, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. State standards may include more stringent requirements for facility design and management in addition to requirements for pipelines. We do not anticipate any significant difficulty in complying with applicable state laws and regulations. Our natural gas pipelines have continuous inspection and compliance programs designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety and pollution control requirements.
We have incorporated all existing requirements into our programs by the required regulatory deadlines and are continually incorporating the new requirements into procedures and budgets. We expect to incur increasing regulatory compliance costs based on the intensification of the regulatory environment and upcoming changes to regulations as outlined above. In addition to regulatory changes, costs may be incurred when there is an accidental release of a commodity transported by our midstream systems, or a regulatory inspection identifies a deficiency in our required programs.
Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters
General
Our natural gas gathering and compression activities are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and safety. As an owner or operator of these facilities, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:

• | requiring the installation of pollution-control equipment, imposing emission or discharge limits or otherwise restricting the way we operate;


• | limiting or prohibiting construction activities in areas, such as air quality non-attainment areas, wetlands, endangered species habitat and other protected areas;


• | delaying system modification or upgrades during review of permit applications and revisions;


• | requiring investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate discharges, releases or pollution conditions associated with our operations or attributable to former operations; and


• | enjoining operations deemed to be in non-compliance with permits issued pursuant to or regulatory requirements imposed by such environmental laws and regulations.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and/or criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties and natural resource damages. Certain environmental statutes impose strict or joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, neighboring landowners and other third parties may file common law claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other pollutants into the environment.
The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. As with the midstream industry in general, complying with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations can increase our capital costs to construct, maintain and operate equipment and facilities. While these laws and regulations affect our maintenance capital expenditures and net income, we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on our business, 
16

financial position or results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we believe that the various activities in which we are presently engaged that are subject to environmental laws and regulations are not expected to materially interrupt or diminish our operational ability to gather natural gas. We cannot assure, however, that future events, such as changes in existing laws or enforcement policies, the promulgation of new laws or regulations, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs. Below is a discussion of the material environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business.
Hydraulic Fracturing Activities
Although we do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, substantially all of our Sponsors’ natural gas production on our dedicated acreage is developed from unconventional sources, such as shales, that require hydraulic fracturing as part of the well completion process. Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and natural gas industry used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has asserted certain regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing and has moved forward with various regulatory actions, including, the issuance of new regulations requiring green completions for hydraulically fractured wells, emission requirements for certain midstream equipment, and an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on its intent to develop regulations under the Toxic Substances and Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing.
Scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways. In June 2015, the EPA issued its draft report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. The draft report found no systemic negative impacts from hydraulic fracturing. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released its final report on the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water. While the language was changed and included the possibility of negative impacts from hydraulic fracturing, it also included the guidance to industry and regulators on how the process can be performed safely. The Bureau of Land Management also has a rule that regulates hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands, although implementation of the rule is currently stayed pending resolution of a number of legal challenges.
Some states, including states in which we operate have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, laws and/or regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on natural gas drilling activities. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular, or otherwise seek to ban some or all of these activities.
We cannot predict whether any other legislation or regulations will be enacted and if so, what its provisions will be. Additional levels of regulation and/or permits required through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal, state or local level could lead to delays, increased operating costs and prohibitions for producers who drill near our pipelines, reduce the volumes of natural gas available to move through our midstream systems and materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.
Hazardous Waste
Our operations generate solid wastes, including some hazardous wastes, that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and comparable state laws, which impose requirements for the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste. RCRA currently exempts certain wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas, which we handle in the course of our operation, including produced water. However, these exploration and production wastes may still be regulated by the EPA or state agencies under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous solid waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws, and it is possible that certain exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous in the future.
Site Remediation
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Under CERCLA, such classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released, and companies that disposed or arranged for disposal of hazardous substances at offsite locations, such as landfills. Although natural gas (and petroleum) is excluded from CERCLA’s definition of “hazardous substance,” in the course of our ordinary operations, we generate wastes that may be designated as hazardous substances. CERCLA authorizes the EPA, states, and, in some cases, 
17

third parties to take actions in response to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment and to seek to recover from the classes of responsible persons the costs they incur to address the release. Under CERCLA, we could be subject to strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous substances have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. In some states, including those in which we operate, site remediation of oil and natural gas facilities is regulated by state agencies with jurisdiction over oil and natural gas operations. The regulated releases and remediation activities, including the classes of persons that may be held responsible for releases of hazardous substances, may be broader than those regulated under CERCLA or RCRA.
We currently own, lease or operate, and may have in the past owned, leased or operated, properties that have been used for the gathering and compression of natural gas. Although we have used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where such substances have been taken for disposal. Such hydrocarbons or other wastes may have migrated to property adjacent to our owned and leased sites or the disposal sites. In addition, some of the properties may have been operated by third parties or by previous owners whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or wastes was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed wastes, including waste disposed of by prior owners or operators; remediate contaminated property, including groundwater contamination, whether from prior owners or operators or other historic activities or spills; or perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. We are not currently a potentially responsible party in any federal or state Superfund site remediation and there are no current, pending or anticipated Superfund response or remedial activities at our facilities.
Air Emissions
The Clean Air Act and comparable state laws, including those states in which we operate, impose various pre-construction and operational permit requirements, noise and emission limits, operational limits, and monitoring, reporting and record-keeping requirements on air emission sources, including on our compressor stations. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations, and/or criminal enforcement actions. Such laws and regulations, for example, require permit limits to address the impacts of noise from our compression operations, and pre-construction permits for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities with the potential to emit air emissions above certain thresholds. Pre-construction permits generally require use of best available control technology, or BACT, to limit air pollutants. 
On August 16, 2012, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ('EPA") published final revisions to the New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS") to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds ("VOCs") and sulfur dioxide from various oil and gas exploration, production, processing and transportation facilities. Additionally, revisions were made to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ("NESHAPS") to further regulate emissions from the oil and natural gas production sector and the transmission and storage of natural gas. Section 111 of the CAA authorized the EPA to develop technology based standards which apply to specific categories of stationary sources. On September 18, 2015, the EPA proposed two new regulations. The first was to provide an update to the new source performance standards, or NSPS, to create new standards for the regulation of methane and volatile organic compounds ("VOCs") emission sources. This proposed rule includes requirements for new fugitive emission and leak detection and reporting requirements. The second was to propose the Source Determination Rule which would clarify the use of the term “adjacent” in determining Title V air permitting requirements as they apply to the oil and natural gas industry for major sources of air emissions. On June 3, 2016, the EPA finalized updates to the final NSPS that created new standards for the regulation of methane and VOC emission sources and published the final Source Determination Rule which clarified the use of the term "adjacent" in determining Title V air permitting requirements as they apply to the oil and natural gas industry for major sources of air emissions. On August 1, 2016 the updates to the NSPS were challenged in the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals industry and state associations and a request for administrative reconsideration was also filed. Additionally, 15 states have filed suit and asked the Court of Appeals to review the need for the changes. 
In October 2015, the EPA lowered the primary and secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAASQ") for ozone. This rule has resulted in additional areas being in non-attainment with federal standards, which could result in us being required to install additional control equipment and restrict operations. Several federal NSPS and NESHAP, and analogous state law requirements, also apply to our facilities and operations. These applicable federal and state standards impose emission limits and operations limits as well as detailed testing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements on the facilities subject to these regulations.
18

On December 29, 2015 the Pennsylvania Environmental Hearing Board ("PAEHB") rendered a decision regarding an appeal filed by National Fuel Gas Midstream Corp of an air permit issued by the PA Department of Environmental Protection ("PADEP"). In that decision, the PAEHB found that the PADEP had properly aggregated emission sources from NFG’s midstream facilities and wells of Seneca Resources Corp. The decision also expanded the definition of “common control” and broadened the notion of “contiguous and adjacent”. This decision was subsequently appealed to the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court and is awaiting a final decision. If the standard goes into effect without any changes, it may have negative impacts on our pending permit applications and could result in determinations that our facilities are major sources of air pollution which could trigger additional permitting and controls. 
We may incur capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with complying with existing and recently proposed rules, or with obtaining or maintaining operating or preconstruction permits and complying with federal, state and local regulations related to air emissions (including air emission reporting requirements). However, we do not believe that such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
Climate Change
The EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act that establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, pre-construction permits, and Title V operating permits for greenhouse gas ("GHG') emissions from certain large stationary sources. Under these regulations, facilities required to obtain PSD permits must meet BACT standards for their GHG emissions established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case-by-case basis. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among others, certain onshore oil and natural gas processing and fractionating facilities, which was recently amended to include gathering and boosting systems and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines.
Additionally, while Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, the prospect for adoption of significant legislation at the federal level to reduce GHG emissions is perceived to be low at this time. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations that limit emissions of GHGs could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that exploration and production operators produce, some of whom are our customers, which could thereby reduce demand for our midstream services. In December 2015, the United National Climate Change Conference was held and an agreement was reached between the countries participating in the conference, including the United States, to limit global warming to less than two degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. This agreement, known as the Paris Agreement, calls for zero net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to be reached during the second half of the 21st century. On September 3, 2016, the United States formally joined the Paris Agreement by submitting a plan of compliance to the United Nations, which could have an adverse effect on our business. 
Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including sediment, and spills and releases of oil, brine and other substances into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into jurisdictional waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, Army Corps of Engineers, or a delegated state agency. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.
The primary federal law related specifically to oil spill liability is the Oil Pollution Act ("OPA"), which amends and augments the oil spill provisions of the Clean Water Act and imposes certain duties and liabilities on certain “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills, or threatened spills, in waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines. The OPA applies joint and several liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. Although defenses exist, they are limited. As such, a violation of the OPA has the potential to adversely affect our operations.
Endangered Species
The Endangered Species Act ("ESA") and analogous state laws protect species threatened with extinction restricting activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Some of our pipelines are located in areas that are or may be designated as protected habitats for endangered or threatened species, including the Northern Long-Eared and Indiana bats, which has a seasonal impact on our construction activities and operations. However, based on species that have been identified and the current application of endangered species laws and regulations, we do not believe that there are any additional species protected under the ESA or state laws that would materially and adversely affect our ability to operate. The 
19

future listing of previously unprotected species in areas where we conduct or may conduct operations, or the designation of critical habitat in these areas, could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our operating activities, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended ("OSHA"), and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA’s hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and implementing regulations and similar state statutes and regulations require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. Certain of our operations are also subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive material.
Employees
The officers of our general partner manage our operations and activities. All of the employees required to conduct and support our operations are employed by CONSOL and are subject to the operational services agreement between us, our general partner and CONSOL. As of December 31, 2016, CONSOL employed approximately 100 people that provide direct support to our operations pursuant to the operational services agreement. In addition, certain officers of our general partner, including our Chief Executive Officer and our General Counsel, are employed by Noble Energy.  Consideration for the general and administrative services provided by such officers is subject to the terms of our omnibus agreement. Our general partner is also party to an employee secondment agreement with Noble Energy, pursuant to which an employee of Noble Energy is seconded to us to provide investor relations and similar functions. Under this agreement, we reimburse Noble Energy for the salary, benefits, insurance, payroll taxes and other employment expenses related to the seconded employee.
Offices
Our principal offices are located at 1000 CONSOL Energy Drive, Canonsburg, Pennsylvania 15317. 
Insurance
We maintain insurance policies with insurers in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent. We cannot, however, assure that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal and property damage or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices.
