Item 1. Business
GENERAL
 
Bear State Financial, Inc. Bear State Financial, Inc. (the "Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is an Arkansas corporation and bank holding company. The Company was originally incorporated in Texas in January 1996 under the name First Federal Bancshares of Arkansas, Inc. to serve as the unitary holding company of First Federal Bank (“First Federal”). The Company reincorporated from the State of Texas to the State of Arkansas on July 20, 2011. On June 3, 2014, the Company changed its name from First Federal Bancshares of Arkansas, Inc. to Bear State Financial, Inc. and adopted the new NASDAQ ticker symbol “BSF.” On June 13, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of First National Security Company (“FNSC”), the parent company for First National Bank headquartered in Hot Springs, Arkansas (“First National”) and Heritage Bank, N.A. headquartered in Jonesboro, Arkansas (“Heritage Bank”). On February 13, 2015 First Federal, First National and Heritage Bank were consolidated into a single charter forming Bear State Bank, N.A (“Bear State Bank” or the “Bank”). On October 1, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of Metropolitan National Bank (“Metropolitan”) headquartered in Springfield, Missouri. 
 
On August 22, 2017, the Company and the Bank entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) with Arvest Bank, an Arkansas banking corporation (“Arvest”), and Arvest Acquisition Sub, Inc., an Arkansas corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Arvest (“Acquisition Sub”), pursuant to which Arvest will acquire the Company and Bear State Bank (the “Merger”). 
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each share of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding as of the effective time of the Merger will be converted into a right to receive $10.28 per share, payable in cash. The shareholders of the Company approved the Merger at a special meeting of shareholders held on November 15, 2017. The Merger is expected to close during late March or April of 2018, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval.
 
The primary asset of the Company is the capital stock of Bear State Bank. The business and management of the Company consists of the business and management of Bear State Bank. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $2.2 billion in total assets, $1.9 billion in total liabilities and $253.2 million in stockholders' equity. The Company's principal executive office is located at 900 South Shackleford Road, Suite 401, Little Rock, Arkansas 72211, and its telephone number is (501) 975-6033.
 
Bear State Bank. Bear State Bank is a state chartered bank conducting business from 42 branches, three personalized technology centers equipped with interactive teller machines (“ITMs”) and two loan production offices throughout Arkansas, Missouri and Southeast Oklahoma.
 
Effective June 28, 2016, the Bank converted from a national bank supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) to a state chartered bank jointly supervised by the Arkansas State Bank Department (“ASBD”) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”). The Bank is also regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the administrator of the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF"). The Bank’s deposits are insured by the DIF to the maximum extent permitted by law. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas (the “FHLB"). 
 
The Bank is a community-oriented financial institution offering a broad line of financial products to individuals and business customers. Retail and business deposit accounts include noninterest bearing and interest bearing checking accounts, savings and money market accounts, certificates of deposit, and individual retirement accounts. Loan products offered by the Bank include residential real estate, consumer, construction, lines of credit, commercial real estate and commercial business loans.

Business Strategy
 
The Bank’s main goal is to be a high-performing community bank in offering the loan and deposit services described below. Management focuses on building high-quality and profitable banking relationships and providing exceptional service to attract and retain customers; building a performance-based culture; refining and expanding the delivery of commercial banking products; expanding market share in attractive markets; rehabilitating or closing underperforming branch locations; and pursuing opportunities to acquire other financial institutions or branches and to develop or acquire businesses that generate non-interest income.
Lending Activities
 
General. At December 31, 2017, the Bank’s portfolio of net loans receivable amounted to $1.7 billion or 77% of the Company's total assets. Loans collateralized by real estate comprised $1.3 billion or 77% of the Bank's total portfolio of loans receivable at December 31, 2017. 
 
Origination, Purchase and Sale of Loans. The lending activities of the Bank are subject to the written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and policies established by management and approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors. Loan originations are obtained from a variety of sources, including referrals, walk-in customers to the Bank’s branch locations, solicitation by loan officers, advertising and the Bank’s Internet website. From time to time, the Bank may also purchase loan participations from other financial institutions.
 
To minimize interest rate risk, fixed rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with terms of fifteen years or greater are typically sold to specific investors in the secondary mortgage market. The rights to service such loans are typically sold with the loans. This allows the Bank to provide its customers competitive long-term fixed rate mortgage products while not exposing the Bank to undue interest rate risk. These loans are originated in conformance with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the specific investor’s underwriting guidelines. The Bank typically locks and confirms the purchase price of the loan on the day of the loan application, which protects the Bank from market price movements and establishes the price that the Bank will receive at the sale of the respective loan. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Bank’s secondary market loan sales amounted to $124.3 million, $162.1 million and $110.4 million, respectively. The Bank is not involved in loan hedging or other speculative mortgage loan origination activities. 
 
In addition to sales of loans in the secondary market, the Bank periodically sells loans or loan participations to other banks in order to comply with the Bank’s loans to one borrower limit or for credit diversification purposes. In such situations, the loans are typically sold with servicing retained. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the balances of loans sold with servicing retained were approximately $3.8 million and $14.7 million, respectively. Loan servicing fee income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was not material. 
 
One- to Four-Family Residential Real Estate Loans. At December 31, 2017, $391.2 million or 23.4% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio consisted of one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Of the $391.2 million of such loans at December 31, 2017, $121.8 million or 31.1% had adjustable rates of interest and $269.4 million or 68.9% had fixed rates of interest. At December 31, 2017, the Bank had $7.1 million of nonaccrual one- to four-family residential real estate loans. See “Nonperforming Assets” in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
The Bank currently originates both fixed rate and adjustable rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans to be sold into the secondary market. Loans originated to be held in the Bank’s loan portfolio are typically originated as fixed or adjustable rate simple interest loans with a maturity of up to fifteen years and an amortization period generally not more than fifteen years. The Bank's residential loans typically include "due on sale" clauses.
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Bank had a loan portfolio of adjustable rate mortgage loans (“ARMs”) totaling $121.8 million as described above. These ARMs provide for an interest rate that adjusts periodically in accordance with a designated index plus a margin. The Bank's adjustable rate loans are assumable (generally without release of the initial borrower), do not contain prepayment penalties and do not provide for negative amortization and typically contain "due on sale" clauses. Adjustable rate loans decrease the risks associated with changes in interest rates but involve other risks, primarily because as interest rates rise, the payment by the borrower rises to the extent permitted by the terms of the loan, thereby increasing the potential for default. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying property may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. 
The Bank’s residential mortgage loans generally do not exceed 80% of the lesser of purchase price or appraised value of the collateral. However, pursuant to the underwriting guidelines adopted by the Board of Directors, the Bank may lend up to 100% of the value of the property securing a one- to four-family residential loan with private mortgage insurance or other similar protection to support the portion of the loan that exceeds 80% of the value. The Bank may, on occasion, extend a loan up to 90% of the value of the secured property without private mortgage insurance coverage. However, these exceptions are minimal and are only approved on loans with exceptional credit scores, sizeable asset reserves, or other compensating factors. 
 
 3


The Bank’s home equity and second mortgage loans are fixed rate loans with fully amortized terms generally of up to fifteen years, variable rate interest only loans with terms up to three years, or home equity lines of credit. The variable rate loans are typically tied to the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate (“Prime Rate”), plus a margin commensurate with the risk as determined by the borrower’s credit score. The Bank originates both fixed and variable rate home equity lines of credit with terms up to five years. The Bank generally limits the total loan-to-value on these mortgages to 85% of the value of the secured property if the Bank holds the first mortgage and 80% if the first mortgage is held by another party.
 
The Bank originates residential construction loans to individual homeowners, local builders and developers for the purpose of constructing one- to four-family residences. At December 31, 2017, these loans totaled $28.7 million with undisbursed funds totaling $13.7 million. The Bank typically requires that permanent financing with the Bank or some other lender be in place prior to closing any non-speculative construction loan. At such time, the loan will convert to a permanent loan at the interest rate established at the initial closing of the construction/permanent loan or be paid off by another permanent lender.
 
The Bank has made residential construction loans to local builders for the purpose of construction of speculative and pre-sold one- to four-family residential properties, and for the construction of pre-sold one- to four-family homes. These loans are subject to credit review, analysis of personal and, if applicable, corporate financial statements, and an appraisal of the property. Loan proceeds are disbursed during the construction term after a satisfactory inspection of the project has been made. Interest on these construction loans is due monthly. The Bank may extend the term of a construction loan if the property has not been sold by the maturity date.
 
Multifamily Residential Real Estate Loans. At December 31, 2017, $89.1 million or 5.3% of the Bank's total loan portfolio consisted of loans collateralized by multifamily residential real estate properties. At December 31, 2017, the Bank did not have any nonaccrual multifamily real estate loans. See “Nonperforming Assets” in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
The Bank has originated both fixed rate and adjustable rate multifamily loans. Fixed rate loans are generally originated with amortization periods not to exceed 25 years, and typically have balloon periods no longer than ten years. Adjustable rate loans are typically amortized over terms up to 25 years, with interest rate adjustments periodically. The Bank’s loan policy limits loan-to-value percentages on multifamily real estate loans to 85%. It is also the Bank's general policy to obtain loan guarantees on its multifamily residential real estate loans from the principals of the borrower; however, the Bank may waive this requirement in certain circumstances.
 
The success of such projects is sensitive to changes in supply and demand conditions in the market for multifamily real estate as well as regional and economic conditions generally.
 
Nonfarm Nonresidential Loans. At December 31, 2017, $557.2 million or 33.3% of the Bank's total loan portfolio consisted of loans collateralized by nonfarm nonresidential properties. At December 31, 2017, the Bank had nonaccrual nonfarm nonresidential loans of $7.4 million. See “Nonperforming Assets” in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
Many of the Bank’s nonfarm nonresidential loans are collateralized by properties such as office buildings, strip and small shopping centers, churches, convenience stores and mini-storage facilities. Loans to borrowers that are corporations, limited liability companies or other such legal entities are also typically personally guaranteed by the principals of the borrowing entity. The financial strength of the guarantors of the loan is a primary underwriting factor.
 
Regulatory guidelines and the Bank’s policies require that properties securing nonfarm nonresidential loans over $250,000 be appraised by licensed real estate appraisers pursuant to state licensing requirements and federal regulations. The Bank underwrites nonfarm nonresidential loans specifically in relation to the type of property being collateralized. Primary underwriting considerations for these loans include the creditworthiness of the borrower, the quality and location of the real estate, the sustainable cash flows of the project, projected occupancy rates, the quality of management involved with the project and the financial strength of the guarantor, if applicable. As part of the underwriting of these loans, the Bank prepares a cash flow analysis that includes a vacancy rate projection, expenses for taxes, insurance, maintenance and repair reserves as well as debt coverage ratios. The Bank’s nonfarm nonresidential loans are generally originated with amortization periods not to exceed 25 years and are structured with three to ten year balloon terms. The Bank attempts to keep maturities of these loans as short as possible in order to enable the Bank to better manage its interest rate risk profile. 
 
Nonfarm nonresidential lending entails additional risks as compared to the Bank’s one- to four-family residential property loans. The repayment on such loans is typically dependent on the successful operation of the real estate project, which is sensitive to changes in supply and demand conditions in the market for commercial real estate, and on regional economic conditions.
 
 4


Farmland Loans. At December 31, 2017, farmland loans amounted to $96.8 million or 5.8% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio. At December 31, 2017, the Bank had $657,000 of nonaccrual farmland loans. See “Nonperforming Assets” in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
The types of credits in this category include loans secured by real estate employed for row crop and livestock production, pasture and grazing, forestry and timber purposes and other similar uses. The terms for these loans are generally ten years or less with fixed or floating rates of interest and amortization periods typically not to exceed 25 years. The underwriting of these loans is based primarily on the cash flow generated by the intended productive use of the property and the financial strength of the borrowing entity and the guarantors of the loan, if any.
 
The risks associated with these loans tend to be directly related to the economics of the underlying property use. There are certain macro-level factors, including environmental and weather patterns, national and global supply and demand for the product and the national political environment, that affect the strength of the agricultural, livestock and timber sectors. The experience and success of the borrower in the market segment, the Bank’s history with the borrower and the financial strength of any guarantors are all considered when extending loans in this category. Advance rates on these types of loans generally do not exceed 75% of the value of the real estate.
 
Construction and Land Development Loans. At December 31, 2017, construction loans amounted to $157.5 million or 9.4% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio. Of the $157.5 million of such loans at December 31, 2017, $107.9 million consisted of construction loans with $32.9 million of unadvanced construction funds and $49.6 million consisted of land loans with available balances totaling $1.9 million. At December 31, 2017, the Bank had $188,000 of nonaccrual construction and land loans. See “Nonperforming Assets” in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
The Bank’s commercial construction loans generally have fixed interest rates or variable rates that float with the Prime Rate and have typically been issued for terms of twelve to twenty-four months. However, the Bank has originated construction loans with longer terms, although this practice has generally been limited to larger projects that could not be completed in the typical twelve to twenty-four month period. Construction loans are typically made with a maximum loan-to-value percentage of 80% of the appraised value of the proposed project.
 
The Bank has made commercial construction loans to property developers and investors for the purpose of constructing multifamily residential housing units, stand-alone and multi-tenant retail projects and office buildings. These loans are subject to an assessment of the feasibility of the proposed project based on anticipated cash flows, vacancy and interest rates, an analysis of the forecasted economics of the particular sub-market where the project will be located, a complete credit underwriting of the guarantors of the proposed loan and an appraisal of the project. Loan proceeds are disbursed during the construction term after a review of the status of completion of the project.
 
Construction lending is generally considered to involve a higher level of risk as compared to other loans. This is due, in part, to the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, and the effects of general economic conditions on developers and builders. In addition, construction loans made on a speculative basis pose a greater potential risk to the Bank than those with a repayment source identified at origination. The Bank analyzes each borrower involved in speculative building and limits the principal amount and/or number of unsold speculative projects at any one time with such borrower. 
 
Commercial Loans. The Bank also offers secured and unsecured commercial loans. Secured commercial loans are primarily collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable and other assets. At December 31, 2017, commercial loans amounted to $345.1 million or 20.6% of the total loan portfolio. Within the commercial loan portfolio, the Bank also maintains a portfolio of syndicated credit facilities. At December 31, 2017, syndicated loans accounted for $178.8 million of the commercial loan portfolio or 10.7% of the total loan portfolio and had $38.7 million in available funds. At December 31, 2017, the Bank had nonaccrual commercial loans of $1.7 million. See “Nonperforming Assets” in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
This portfolio includes loans with funds used for commercial purposes including loans to finance working capital needs, including agricultural; purchase equipment; support accounts receivable and inventory and other similar business needs. Other common uses of funds include leveraged buyouts, dividends, acquisitions and expansions. 
 
Primary underwriting considerations for these loans include a review of the historical and prospective cash flows of the borrower and the sustainability of these cash flows, the expected long term viability of the business, the quality and marketability of the collateral (if any) and the financial support offered by any guarantors to the transaction. The Bank's commercial loans are originated with fixed and variable interest rates and maturities generally range between one and five years. These loans are typically based on a maximum fifteen year amortization schedule. 
 
 5


Consumer Loans. The consumer loans offered by the Bank primarily consist of automobile loans, deposit account secured loans, and unsecured loans. Consumer loans amounted to $36.0 million or 2.2% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017, of which $12.8 million consisted of automobile loans and $23.2 million consisted of other consumer loans. At December 31, 2017, the Bank had nonaccrual consumer loans of $212,000. See “Nonperforming Assets” in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
The Bank's vehicle loans are typically originated for the purchase of new and used cars and trucks. Such loans are generally originated with a maximum term of six years. The Bank may offer extended terms on automobile loans to some customers based upon their creditworthiness.
 
Other consumer loans consist primarily of deposit account loans and unsecured loans. Loans secured by deposit accounts are generally originated for up to 95% of the deposit account balance, with a hold placed on the account restricting the withdrawal of the deposit account balance.
 
Consumer loans entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of depreciation, damage or loss. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower's continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans. 
 
Sources of Funds
 
General. Deposits are the primary source of the Bank's funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition to deposits, the Bank derives funds from loan principal repayments and prepayments and interest payments, maturities, sales and calls of investment securities, and advances from the FHLB. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. Borrowings are used when funds from loan and deposit sources are insufficient to meet funding needs or for asset/liability management purposes. FHLB advances are the primary source of borrowings. 
 
Deposits. The Bank's deposit products include a broad selection of deposit instruments, including checking accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts and term certificate accounts. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit, early withdrawal penalties and the interest rate.
 
The Bank considers its primary market area to be Arkansas, Missouri and Southeast Oklahoma. The Bank utilizes traditional marketing methods to attract new customers and deposits. The Bank does not advertise for retail deposits outside of its primary market area. The Bank uses brokered deposits and non-brokered institutional internet certificates of deposit as additional sources of funds to augment the retail CD market. At December 31, 2017, internet certificates of deposit represented approximately 1.9% of deposits and brokered deposits represented approximately 1.2% of deposits.
 
The Bank has been competitive in the types of accounts and in interest rates it has offered on its deposit products but does not necessarily seek to match the highest rates paid by competing institutions. Although market demand generally dictates which deposit maturities and rates will be accepted by the public, the Bank intends to continue to offer longer-term deposits to the extent possible and consistent with its asset and liability management goals. In addition, the Bank may use brokered deposits when this alternative funding source provides more cost effective deposits with terms that are consistent with its asset and liability management goals.
 
Borrowed funds. The Bank utilizes FHLB advances in its normal operating and investing activities when this funding source offers cost effective funds that are consistent with the Bank’s asset and liability management goals. The Bank pledges substantially all of its loans under a blanket lien and through certain loans held in custody at FHLB. The Bank’s borrowing capacity with the FHLB is directly tied to the amount of the Bank’s qualifying loans pledged. FHLB advances are subject to prepayment penalties if repaid prior to the maturity date.
 
At December 31, 2017, the Bank’s unused borrowing availability primarily consisted of (1) $230.0 million of available borrowing capacity with the FHLB, (2) $116.9 million of investment securities available to pledge for federal funds or other borrowings and (3) $103.0 million of available unsecured federal funds borrowing lines. In addition, at December 31, 2017, the Company had available borrowing capacity of $12.4 million.

The Bank faces strong competition in its market areas both in attracting deposits and making loans. The most direct competition for deposits has historically come from commercial banks, savings associations and credit unions. In addition, the Bank has faced additional significant competition for investors' funds from short-term money market securities, mutual funds and other corporate and government securities. The ability of the Bank to attract and retain savings and certificates of deposit depends on its ability to generally provide a rate of return, liquidity and risk comparable to that offered by competing investment opportunities. The Bank’s ability to increase checking deposits depends on offering competitive checking accounts and promoting these products through effective channels. Additionally, the Bank offers convenient hours, locations and online services to maintain and attract customers.
 
The Bank experiences strong competition for loans principally from commercial banks and mortgage companies. The Bank competes for loans through interest rates, loan terms, and fees charged and the efficiency and quality of services provided.

Employees
 The Company and the Bank had 380 full-time employees and 27 part-time employees at December 31, 2017, compared to 466 full-time employees and 36 part-time employees at December 31, 2016. The decrease in the number of employees is primarily related to branch consolidations and efficiencies gained in the integration of Metropolitan. None of our employees are represented by any union or similar group, and the Bank believes that it enjoys good relations with its personnel.
Subsidiaries
 The Bank is permitted to invest up to 2% of its assets in the capital stock of, or secured or unsecured loans to, subsidiary service corporations, with an additional investment of 1% of assets when such additional investment is utilized primarily for community development purposes. In addition to investments in service corporations, the Bank is permitted to invest an unlimited amount in operating subsidiaries engaged solely in activities in which the Bank may engage directly. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank does not have any operating subsidiaries. 
 
Available Information
 The Company makes available free of charge its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to such reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as soon as reasonably practicable on or through its website located at www.bearstatefinancial.com after filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Information on, or accessible through, the Company’s website is not a part of and is not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the inclusion of the Company’s website address in this report is an inactive textual reference.
REGULATION
 
Set forth below is a brief description of those laws and regulations which, together with the descriptions of laws and regulations contained elsewhere herein, are deemed material to an investor's understanding of the extent to which the Company and the Bank are regulated. The description of the laws and regulations hereunder, as well as descriptions of laws and regulations contained elsewhere herein, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations.
The Company
 General. The Company, as a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act ("BHCA"), is subject to FRB regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements. The most recent regulatory examination of the Company by the FRB was conducted during November 2017. As a subsidiary of a bank holding company, the Bank is also subject to certain restrictions in its dealings with the Company and affiliates thereof.
 
The BHCA limits the activities of the Company and any entities controlled by the Company to the activities of banking, managing and controlling banks, furnishing or performing services for its subsidiaries, and any other activity that the FRB determines to be incidental to or clearly and closely related to banking.
 
Acquisitions. Under the BHCA, a bank holding company must obtain prior FRB approval before engaging in acquisitions of banks or bank holding companies. In particular, the FRB must generally approve:
 
● | the acquisition of direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of a bank or bank holding company if the acquisition results in the company’s control of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of the bank or bank holding company,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the acquisition by a bank holding company or by a subsidiary thereof, other than a bank, of all or substantially all of the assets of a bank, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the merger or consolidation of bank holding companies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 
Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates.   Transactions between an insured depository institution and its "affiliates" are subject to quantitative and qualitative restrictions under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. Affiliates generally include, among other entities, the institution’s holding company and companies that are controlled by or under common control with the institution. Generally, Section 23A (i) limits the extent to which the insured depository institution or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such association’s capital stock and surplus, and contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to “covered transactions” as well as certain other transactions and requires that all transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least favorable, to the association or subsidiary as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans to, purchase of assets from, issuance of a guarantee to an affiliate and similar transactions. Section 23B transactions also apply to the provision of services and the sale of assets by an insured depository institution to an affiliate.

In addition, Sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act place restrictions on loans to executive officers, directors and principal stockholders. Under Section 22(h), loans to a director, an executive officer and to a greater than 10% stockholder of an institution (“a principal stockholder”), and certain affiliated interests of either, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests, the institution’s loans to one borrower limit (generally equal to 15% of the institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus). Section 22(h) also requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons unless the loans are made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that (i) is widely available to employees of the institution and (ii) does not give preference to any director, executive officer or principal stockholder, or certain affiliated interests of either, over other employees of the institution. Section 22(h) also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by an institution to all insiders cannot exceed the institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Furthermore, Section 22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. At December 31, 2017, the Bank was in compliance with the above restrictions. 
 
Incentive Compensation. During the second quarter of 2016, the U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board and the SEC, proposed revised rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets (including the Company and the Bank). The proposed revised rules would establish general qualitative requirements applicable to all covered entities, which would include (i) prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation; (ii) prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to a material financial loss; (iii) establishing requirements for performance measures to appropriately balance risk and reward; (iv) requiring board of director oversight of incentive arrangements; and (v) mandating appropriate record-keeping. Under the proposed rule, larger financial institutions with total consolidated assets of at least $50 billion would also be subject to additional requirements applicable to such institutions’ “senior executive officers” and “significant risk-takers.” These additional requirements would not be applicable to the Company or the Bank, each of which currently have less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets.
 
The Bank
 General. The Bank is chartered as an Arkansas state bank and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, making it primarily subject to regulation and supervision by both the Federal Reserve Board and the Arkansas State Bank Department. In addition, the Bank is subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that may be charged, and limitations on the types of investments that may be made and on the types of services that may be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the bank.
 
State Regulation. The Bank is subject to examination and regulation by the Arkansas State Bank Department. The Arkansas State Bank Department may also examine the activities of the bank holding company in conjunction with its examination of the bank subsidiary or in conjunction with the FRB’s examination of the bank holding company. The extent of such examination will depend upon the complexity and level of debt owed by the bank holding company, and other various criteria as determined by the Arkansas State Bank Department. The Bank is also required to submit certain reports filed with the FRB to the Arkansas State Bank Department.
 
Under the Arkansas Banking Code of 1997, the acquisition of more than 25% of any class of the outstanding capital stock of any bank located in Arkansas requires approval of the Arkansas State Bank Commissioner (the “Bank Commissioner”). Additionally, a bank holding company may not acquire any bank if after such acquisition the holding company would control, directly or indirectly, banks having 25% of the total bank deposits (excluding deposits from other banks and public funds) in the State of Arkansas. A bank holding company also cannot own more than one bank subsidiary if any of its bank subsidiaries has been chartered for less than five years.
 
The Bank Commissioner has the authority, with the consent of the Governor of the State of Arkansas, to declare a state of emergency and temporarily modify or suspend banking laws and regulations in communities where such a state of emergency exists. The Bank Commissioner may also authorize a bank to close its offices and any day when such bank offices are closed will be treated as a legal holiday, and any director, officer or employee of such bank shall not incur any liability related to such emergency closing. To date no such state of emergency has been declared to exist by the Bank Commissioner.

Restrictions on Bank Subsidiary. 
 Lending Limits. The lending and investment authority of the Bank is derived from Arkansas law. The lending power is generally subject to certain restrictions, including the amount which may be lent to a single borrower. Under Arkansas law, the obligations of one borrower to a bank may not exceed 20% of the bank’s capital base. 
 
Reserve Requirements. Arkansas law requires state chartered banks to maintain such reserves as are required by the applicable federal regulatory agency. Federal banking laws require all insured banks to maintain reserves against their checking and transaction accounts (primarily checking accounts, NOW and Super NOW checking accounts). Because reserves must generally be maintained in cash, non-interest bearing accounts or in accounts that earn only a nominal amount of interest, the effect of the reserve requirements is to increase our cost of funds. 
 
 9


Payment of Dividends. Regulations of the FRB and the Arkansas State Bank Department limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company without the prior approval of such agencies. Pursuant to FRB regulations, the maximum dividend that the Bank may pay without prior approval from the FRB is the Bank’s year-to-date net profits plus retained net profits from the preceding two years. The Arkansas State Bank Department currently limits the amount of dividends that the Bank can pay the Company to 75% of its net profits after taxes for the current year plus 75% of its retained net profits after taxes for the immediately preceding year.
 
Insurance of Accounts. FDIC insurance covers all deposit accounts, including checking and savings accounts, money market deposit accounts and certificates of deposit. FDIC insurance does not cover other financial products and services that banks may offer, such as stocks, bonds, mutual fund shares, life insurance policies, annuities or securities. The standard insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category. 
 
As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, FDIC-insured institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the FDIC. The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including the Bank, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is aware of no existing circumstances that would result in termination of the Bank's deposit insurance.
 
Substantially all of the deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The FDIC utilizes a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank’s capital level and supervisory rating. 
 
A bank’s assessment is calculated by multiplying its assessment rate by its assessment base. A bank’s assessment base and assessment rate are determined each quarter. The deposit insurance assessment base is defined as average consolidated total assets for the assessment period less average tangible equity capital with potential adjustments for unsecured debt, brokered deposits and depository institution debts.  Beginning in the third quarter of 2016, the FDIC issued revised pricing models for assessment rate. Under the revised assessment system for small banks (defined by the FDIC as less than $10 billion in assets), the FDIC will determine assessment rates using financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from a statistical model estimating the probability of failure over three years. The new pricing system eliminates risk categories but established minimum and maximum assessment rates based on a bank’s CAMELs composite ratings. 
 
FDIC insurance expense totaled $1.1 million for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and $960,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. FDIC insurance expense includes deposit insurance assessments and Financing Corporation (“FICO”) assessments related to outstanding FICO bonds. 
 
Financial Regulatory Reform
 
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act represented a sweeping reform of the U.S. supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions and capital markets in the wake of the global financial crisis, certain aspects of which are described below in more detail. In particular, and among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act: created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), which is authorized to regulate providers of consumer credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services; narrowed the scope of federal preemption of state consumer laws enjoyed by national banks and federal savings associations and expanded the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation; imposed more stringent capital requirements on bank holding companies and subjected certain activities, including interstate mergers and acquisitions, to heightened capital conditions; with respect to mortgage lending, (i) significantly expanded requirements applicable to loans secured by one-to-four family residential real property, (ii) imposed strict rules on mortgage servicing, and (iii) required the originator of a securitized loan, or the sponsor of a securitization, to retain at least 5% of the credit risk of securitized exposures unless the underlying exposures are qualified residential mortgages or meet certain underwriting standards; repealed the prohibition on the payment of interest on business checking accounts; restricted the interchange fees payable on debit card transactions for issuers with $10 billion in assets or greater; in the so-called “Volcker Rule,” subject to numerous exceptions, prohibited depository institutions and affiliates from certain investments in, and sponsorship of, hedge funds and private equity funds and from engaging in proprietary trading; enhanced oversight of credit rating agencies; and prohibited banking agency requirements tied to credit ratings. These statutory changes shifted the regulatory framework for financial institutions, impacted the way in which they do business and have the potential to constrain revenues of financial institutions. 
 
 10


Numerous provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act were required to be implemented through rulemaking by the appropriate federal regulatory agencies. Many of the required regulations have been issued and others have been released for public comment, but are not yet final. Although the reforms primarily targeted systemically important financial service providers, their influence has and is expected to continue to filter down in varying degrees to smaller institutions over time. Our management will continue to evaluate the effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on the business and operations of the Company and the Bank.
 
Consumer Laws and Regulations. Banks are subject to certain laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers. Among the more prominent of such laws and regulations are the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and consumer privacy protection provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and comparable state laws. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions deal with consumers. With respect to consumer privacy, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act generally prohibits disclosure of customer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the customer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to customers annually.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB within the Federal Reserve System. The CFPB is tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing products and services offered to bank consumers. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are more stringent than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB against state-chartered institutions. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to consumer protection laws and regulations for depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB, but continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulatory agencies for consumer compliance purposes.
 
During 2013, the CFPB issued a series of proposed and final rules related to mortgage loan origination and mortgage loan servicing. In particular, in January 2013, the CFPB issued its final rule, which was effective January 10, 2014, on ability to repay and qualified mortgage standards to implement various requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act amending the Truth in Lending Act. The final rule requires mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination, based on verified and documented information, that a borrower will have the ability to repay a mortgage loan according to its terms before making the loan. The final rule also includes a definition of a “qualified mortgage,” which provides the lender with a presumption that the ability to repay requirements has been met. This presumption is conclusive (i.e. a safe harbor) if the loan is a “prime” loan and rebuttable if the loan is a higher-priced, or subprime, loan. The ability-to-repay rule has the potential to significantly affect our business, as a borrower can challenge a loan’s status as a qualified mortgage or that the lender otherwise established the borrower’s ability to repay in a direct cause of action for three years from the origination date, or as a defense to foreclosure at any time. In addition, the value and marketability of non-qualified mortgages may be adversely affected.
 
Interchange Fees. The Dodd-Frank Act also amended the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to require that the amount of any interchange fee charged for electronic debit transactions by debit card issuers having assets over $10 billion must be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer, commonly referred to as the “Durbin Amendment”. The FRB has adopted final rules which limit the maximum permissible interchange fees that such issuers can receive for an electronic debit transaction. Although the restrictions on interchange fees do not apply to institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, the price controls could negatively impact bankcard services income for smaller banks if the reductions that are required of larger banks cause industry-wide reduction of swipe fees.
 
Volcker Rule. The Dodd-Frank Act amended the BHCA to require the federal banking regulatory agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring a covered fund (such as a hedge fund and/or private equity fund), commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule.” In December 2013, the federal banking regulatory agencies adopted a final rule construing the Volcker Rule, which became effective April 1, 2014. Banking entities had until July 21, 2017 to conform their activities to the requirements of the rule.
 
The Increasing Regulatory Emphasis on Capital
 
Regulatory capital represents the net assets of a financial institution available to absorb losses. Because of the risks attendant to their business, depository institutions are generally required to hold more capital than other businesses, which directly affects earnings capabilities. While capital has historically been one of the key measures of the financial health of both bank holding companies and banks, its role became fundamentally more important in the wake of the global financial crisis, as the banking regulators recognized that the amount and quality of capital held by banks prior to the crisis was insufficient to absorb losses during periods of severe stress. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, discussed below, establish strengthened capital standards for banks and bank holding companies, require more capital to be held in the form of common stock and disallow certain funds from being included in capital determinations. Once fully implemented, these standards will represent regulatory capital requirements that are significantly more stringent than those in place previously.
 
 11


Required Capital Levels. In July of 2013, the U.S. federal banking agencies approved the implementation of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms in pertinent part, and, at the same time, promulgated rules effecting certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Basel III Rule”). In contrast to previous capital requirements, which were merely guidelines, Basel III was released in the form of regulations by each of the federal regulatory agencies. The Basel III Rule is applicable to all financial institutions that are subject to minimum capital requirements, including federal and state banks and savings and loan associations, as well as to bank and savings and loan holding companies other than “small bank holding companies” (generally bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $1 billion).
 
The minimum capital standards effective for the year ended December 31, 2017 were:
 

● | A minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A minimum required amount of Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets of 6%;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A minimum required amount of Total Capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of 8%; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total assets equal to 4% in all circumstances.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
For these purposes, “Common Equity Tier 1 Capital,” consists primarily of common stock, related surplus (net of treasury stock), retained earnings, and Common Equity Tier 1 minority interests, subject to certain regulatory adjustments. “Tier 1 Capital” consists primarily of common stock and related surplus less intangible assets (other than certain loan servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships). “Total Capital” consists primarily of Tier 1 Capital plus “Tier 2 Capital,” which includes other non-permanent capital items, such as certain other debt and equity instruments that do not qualify as Tier 1 Capital, and a portion of a bank’s allowance for loan and lease losses. Further, risk-weighted assets for the purpose of the risk-weighted ratio calculations consist of balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures to which required risk weightings of 0% to 1250% are applied. 
 
The Basel III Rules also established a fully-phased “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum risk-based capital requirements. The conservation buffer, when added to the capital requirements, results in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution is subject to limitations on certain activities including payment of dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers if its capital level is below the buffer amount.
 
The capital standards described above are minimum requirements under Basel III. Bank regulatory agencies uniformly encourage banks and bank holding companies to be “well-capitalized” and, to that end, federal law and regulations provide various incentives for banking organizations to maintain regulatory capital at levels in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. For example, a banking organization that is “well-capitalized” may: (i) qualify for exemptions from prior notice or application requirements otherwise applicable to certain types of activities; (ii) qualify for expedited processing of other required notices or applications; and (iii) accept, roll-over or renew brokered deposits. Under the capital regulations of the FDIC and FRB, in order to be “well-capitalized,” a banking organization, for the year ended December 31, 2017, must have maintained:
 

● | A ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 6.5% or greater,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8% or greater,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A ratio of Total Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 10% or greater, and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total assets of 5% or greater.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDIC and FRB guidelines also provide that banks and bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions would be expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. Furthermore, the guidelines indicate that the agencies will continue to consider a “tangible Tier 1 leverage ratio” (deducting all intangibles) in evaluating proposals for expansion or to engage in new activities.
 
 12


Higher capital levels could also be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of individual banking organizations. For example, the FRB’s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk, or the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities. Further, any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth would be expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions (i.e., Tier 1 Capital less all intangible assets), well above the minimum levels.
 
Prompt Corrective Action. A banking organization’s capital plays an important role in connection with regulatory enforcement as well. Federal law provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The extent of the regulators’ powers depends on whether the institution in question is “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized,” in each case as defined by regulation. Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators’ corrective powers include: (i) requiring the institution to submit a capital restoration plan; (ii) limiting the institution’s asset growth and restricting its activities; (iii) requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to sell itself; (iv) restricting transactions between the institution and its affiliates; (v) restricting the interest rate that the institution may pay on deposits; (vi) ordering a new election of directors of the institution; (vii) requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; (viii) prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; (ix) requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; (x) prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and (xi) ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution. 
 
Other Financial Regulatory Matters
 
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, which is one of 11 regional FHLBs. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the FHLB. At December 31, 2017, the Bank had $374.7 million of outstanding FHLB advances. 
 
As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB in an amount equal to the sum of 0.04% of total assets as of the previous December 31 and 4.10% of outstanding advances. At December 31, 2017, the Bank had $19.1 million in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. No ready market exists for such stock and it has no quoted market value.
 
Federal Reserve System. The FRB requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts and non-personal time deposits (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). For 2017: the first $15.5 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempt from the reserve requirements; for transaction accounts aggregating more than $15.5 million to $115.1 million, the reserve requirement is 3% of total transaction accounts; and for net transaction accounts in excess of $115.1 million, the reserve requirement is $3.0 million plus 10% of the aggregate amount of total transaction accounts in excess of $115.1 million. These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the FRB. Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or a noninterest bearing account at an FRB, the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce an institution's earning assets.
 
Additionally, each member bank is required to hold stock in its regional federal reserve bank. The stock cannot be sold, traded, or pledged as collateral for loans. At December 31, 2017, the Bank had $7.6 million in FRB stock. As specified by law, member banks receive a six percent annual dividend on their FRB stock.
 
Concentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Regulations. Federal banking regulators promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending, which guidance is applicable to both federal and state chartered financial institutions. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100% or more of total capital or (ii) total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm nonresidential properties (excluding loans secured by owner-occupied properties) and loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 300% or more of total capital and the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address the following key elements, including board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. As of December 31, 2017, the Company did not exceed the levels to be considered to have a concentration in commercial real estate lending.
 
 13


Community Reinvestment Act Requirements.  The Community Reinvestment Act imposes a continuing and affirmative obligation on the Bank to, in a safe and sound manner, help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Federal regulators regularly assess the Bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of its communities. Applications for acquisitions are affected by the evaluation of a bank’s effectiveness in meeting its Community Reinvestment Act requirements. 
 
Anti-Money Laundering. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”) is designed to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the U.S. financial system and has significant implications for depository institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The Patriot Act mandates financial services companies to have policies and procedures with respect to measures designed to address any or all of the following matters: (i) customer identification programs; (ii) money laundering; (iii) terrorist financing; (iv) identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions; (v) currency crimes; and (vi) cooperation between financial institutions and law enforcement authorities.
