ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
Dynasil Corporation of America was founded as a New Jersey corporation in 1960 and incorporated in the state of Delaware through a migratory merger in March 2008. Our corporate headquarters are located at 313 Washington Street, Suite 403, Newton, MA 02458, and our corporate website is www.dynasil.com. You can access, free of charge, our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any other amendments to those reports, through a link at our website, or at the Commission’s website at www.sec.gov.
 
We have the following three reporting segments based on our main operating activities:
 

· | Contract Research: The Contract Research segment consists of the Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc. (“RMD”) business unit, which is among the largest small business participants in United States (“U.S.”) government-funded research.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Optics: The Optics segment encompasses four business units – Dynasil Fused Silica, Evaporated Metal Films, Hilger Crystals, and Optometrics – that manufacture commercial products, including optical crystals for sensing in the security and medical imaging markets, as well as optical components, optical coatings and optical materials for scientific instrumentation and other applications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Biomedical: The Biomedical segment consists of a single business unit, Dynasil Biomedical Corporation (“Dynasil Biomedical”), a medical technology incubator which owns rights to certain early stage medical technologies. In October 2013, Dynasil Biomedical formed Xcede Technologies, Inc. (“Xcede”), a joint venture with Mayo Clinic to spin out and separately fund the development of a tissue sealant technology. At September 30, 2017, Dynasil Biomedical owned approximately 61% of the outstanding common and preferred stock of Xcede, thus Xcede is included in our consolidated financial statements. Dynasil Biomedical currently has no operations other than relating to its equity ownership in Xcede.

The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting and accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). Segment information appearing in Note 16 – Segment, Customer and Geographical Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements is also presented on this basis.
 
Our business strategy is based on continued development and expansion of our funded research portfolio, investment in the commercialization of the technologies originating from our Contract Research segment, organic growth of existing Optics segment products, continuing development of the Xcede medical technologies using outside funding and acquisitions that align with our core competencies.
 
Historical Growth by Acquisition
 
Through a series of acquisitions beginning in March 2005, Dynasil has evolved from a single product line optics company to one focused on multiple optical product lines and a significant contract research business focused on advanced materials used in radiation detection and other advanced instrumentation. Our revenue has increased from $2 million in FY 2004 to $37 million in FY 2017.
 
The acquisitions we completed during this period included:
 

· | Optometrics: In March 2005, we acquired Optometrics LLC (“Optometrics”), a worldwide supplier of optical components and instruments, including diffraction gratings, interference filters, monochromators, laser optics and specialized optical systems.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Evaporated Metal Films: In October 2006, we acquired Evaporated Metal Films Corporation (“EMF”), an optical thin-film coatings company with a broad range of application markets, including solar energy, display systems, dental photography, optical instruments, satellite communications and lighting.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | RMD: In July 2008, we acquired Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc. (“RMD”), a contract research company, and RMD Instruments, LLC (“Dynasil Products”), a precision instruments company that manufactured and sold instruments in the medical imaging and industrial markets, including hand-held analyzers for lead paint and gamma medical probes for cancer surgery. The lead paint detector and gamma medical probe businesses were sold in fiscal 2014.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Hilger Crystals: In July 2010, we acquired Hilger Crystals, Ltd., (“Hilger”) a manufacturer of synthetic crystals applicable to a wide range of industrial, medical, and homeland security applications with a long history of supplying high-quality synthetic crystals for infrared spectroscopy, X-ray and gamma ray detection.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Biomedical technologies: In April 2011, we acquired the rights to six early stage biomedical technologies from Dr. Daniel Ericson, a former hematologist at the Mayo Clinic, which jointly owns rights to certain of the technologies acquired. The activity of our Biomedical segment is currently focused on the development of the tissue sealant technology that was part of this transaction in its Xcede subsidiary.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | DichroTec Thin Films: In June 2014, our EMF subsidiary acquired the assets of DichroTec Thin Films LLC, another optical thin-film coatings company with a broad range of applications, many of which are similar to EMF’s applications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contract Research – the Science Behind our Technology 
 
Our Contract Research segment’s business unit, RMD, is among the largest small business participants in U.S. government-funded research, performing research and development activities for government agencies including Department of Energy, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, National Institutes of Health and NASA.
 
RMD develops advanced technology in materials, sensors and prototype instruments that detect or measure radiation, light, magnetism or sound for use in security, medical and industrial applications. RMD has research expertise in material science, radiation detection, digital imaging technology, magnetic imaging, laser optics and photonics. As of September 30, 2017, our Contract Research segment had a total of 71 employees, including 23 Ph.D. level scientists. RMD serves as an incubator to expand our patent portfolio enabling the opportunity to advance our technology from development to commercialization using government-funded research. As of September 30, 2017, RMD had a portfolio of 68 issued U.S. patents and 43 pending patent applications, compared with 68 issued patents and 42 pending patent applications at the same point in 2016.

For over thirty years, RMD has successfully conducted government research under the auspices of the Small Business Innovation Research (“SBIR”) program. In recent years, RMD has augmented its SBIR research with larger, competitively bid government research and development contracts. To grow our research portfolio within the federal government, we are broadening our relationships within key federal funding agencies and the U.S. military. RMD also provides research for non-governmental entities in areas where it has the appropriate expertise. Such research is currently not a significant portion of RMD’s revenue. Our research initiatives are aligned with our focus on the homeland security, medical and industrial markets. As of September 30, 2017, RMD had a contract backlog of approximately $33.2 million, of which approximately 51% is SBIR contracts. 
 
RMD competes for contract research work against a variety of small and large entities, including universities that submit research proposals based on specific government solicitations. We generate revenue under various types of contracts, which include Cost Reimbursement, Time & Materials (T&M), Fixed Price-Level of Effort and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contracts. We believe that RMD’s reputation for conducting state-of-the art research and development, as well as the quality of its proposals, are significant competitive advantages. In addition, RMD maintains strong working relationships with universities, government agencies, national laboratories, research hospitals and corporations. However, some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and human resources than we have and may be better able to operate large, well-funded research and development programs. 
 
We believe that research projects can provide an important source for new commercial products in areas such as medical imaging, industrial sensors, critical care and point of care diagnostics and homeland security. For example, Dynasil Products’ lead paint analyzer and gamma medical probes businesses, which were sold in fiscal year 2014, emanated from the RMD portfolio. Most recently, our government-funded research work supported the development of our CLYC dual-mode radiation detection technology which we are currently selling commercially. 
 
Our Optical Technology
  We specialize in the production of optical materials, components and coatings for various applications in the medical, industrial, and homeland security/defense sectors.
 
Our Optics segment supplies synthetic crystals, optical materials, components, and coatings that are used in devices such as baggage scanners, medical imaging systems, optical instruments, lasers, analytical instruments, automotive components, semiconductor/electronic devices, spacecraft/aircraft components and advertising displays. These products are offered through four business units (Dynasil Fused Silica, Optometrics, Hilger and EMF).
 
We compete for business with fabricators of industrial optical materials, other optical components manufacturers, other optical crystal manufacturers and other optical coaters as well as other analytical instruments manufacturers and synthetic crystal manufacturers. We believe our proprietary processes, reputation, specialty product offering, products in development and the price at which we offer our products enable us to successfully compete in these markets. However, many of our competitors have greater financial, sales and marketing resources than we do, which may enable them to develop and market products that would compete against those developed by us.
 
Our products are distributed through a direct sales and marketing staff of ten people and through other channels, including manufacturer’s representatives and distributors in various foreign countries for international sales and U.S. manufacturers’ representatives for certain product lines. Marketing efforts include direct customer contact through sales visits, advertising in trade publications, attendance at trade shows and our newly designed e-commerce website.
 
Biomedical: Xcede and Our Development of a Tissue Sealant Technology
 
Xcede's first product currently under development is a hemostatic patch, designed to be fully biocompatible, to be used when conventional techniques are inadequate or impractical during general surgery on the kidneys, liver and spleen. Xcede’s hemostatic patch (“Xcede Patch”) is intended to be used during surgical procedures to stop bleeding (hemostasis). Preclinical testing to date indicates this product promotes hemostasis within 60 seconds, a time that is faster than currently approved hemostatic patches. As described above, in 2011, Dynasil Biomedical (“DBM”) acquired rights to the underlying tissue sealant technology as part of a transaction with a former hematologist at the Mayo Clinic. Since that time, DBM has invested significant capital developing this tissue sealant technology, including costs to further the related intellectual property rights and to conduct animal studies.

Beginning at its inception and through November 2016, Xcede funded its research activities through the issuance of convertible notes bearing interest at 5% (“the Notes”) pursuant to a note purchase agreement dated October 2013 and amended. The Notes provided for the issuance of up to $5.2 million in the aggregate principal amount and were sold to external investors and certain directors and officers of the Company and issued to DBM in exchange for certain services. The Notes were convertible into equity of Xcede.
 
In November 2016, Dynasil, through DBM, committed to invest $1.2 million of cash into Xcede over the following 18 months, of which $0.7 million has been invested as of September 30, 2017, in exchange for Series B convertible preferred stock of Xcede (“Series B Preferred). In conjunction with DBM’s committed investment, all $5.5 million in existing Notes and accrued interest were converted into 5,394,120 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock of Xcede (“Series A Preferred”) at a 20% discount to the price per share of the Series B Preferred, in accordance with the amended provisions of the Notes. Series A Preferred participants include both outside investors (accounted for as noncontrolling interest) and DBM. The outside investors converted $3.1 million of Notes and accrued interest into 3,055,551 shares of Series A Preferred. DBM converted its $2.4 million of Notes and accrued interest into 2,338,569 shares of Series A Preferred.
 
In addition to DBM, Xcede’s investors consist of Mayo Clinic Ventures, Southern Initiative Minnesota Foundation, Rochester Area Economic Development Inc., angel investors and certain members of Dynasil’s executive management team and board of directors.
 
As of September 30, 2017, DBM owned approximately 61% of Xcede’s outstanding Common Stock and Preferred Stock and, as a result, Xcede is included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows. Due to the issuance of Preferred Stock, DBM’s ownership percentage in Xcede decreased to less than 80% and Xcede will no longer be included in the Dynasil consolidated federal tax return for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. As a result, the Company will no longer be able to offset taxable income or benefit from net operating losses and other tax attributes related to Xcede. (See Note 9 – Income Taxes.)
 
In January 2016, Xcede announced that it had signed three agreements with Cook Biotech Inc. of West Lafayette, Indiana (“Cook”), including a Development Agreement, a License Agreement and a Supply Agreement, in connection with the development, regulatory approval and production of Xcede’s hemostatic patch (“Xcede’s Patch”). In November 2016, Xcede entered into another Services Agreement, a Secured Promissory Note, a Loan Agreement, a Security Agreement and an Intellectual Property Security Agreement (collectively the “Note Agreement”) with Cook, in which Cook committed to fund the pre-clinical testing of, and subject to the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, to initiate first in human clinical trials for, the Xcede Patch. Under the terms of the Note Agreement, in exchange for the services performed by Cook, Xcede has committed to a multiple draw credit facility in the aggregate amount not to exceed $1.5 million. Three draws of principal will be available, each in the amount of $500,000, upon satisfaction of conditions identified in the Note Agreement. The principal amounts outstanding bear interest at a fixed rate of 2% and are secured by all the rights of Xcede under the Development Agreement, Supply Agreement, and License Agreement, all the rights to the data and work product arising from the clinical trial being performed under the Services Agreement, all regulatory approvals for the Xcede Patch, all patent and patent applications owned or controlled by Xcede, and all trademark and service mark registrations and applications. The outstanding principal and unpaid interest are due and payable in full at the earlier of closing of an acquisition transaction or December 31, 2025.
 
Strategy to Commercialize our Technologies
 
Our business strategy focuses on combining our expertise in funded research, product development and technology innovation to commercialize detection and analysis equipment for the homeland security, industrial and medical markets. We are executing on this strategy by:
 

· | developing and expanding our research portfolio;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | seeking to commercialize the technologies coming from our Contract Research segment;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | growing organically through investment in existing businesses; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | identifying and investing in those technologies with the greatest revenue and growth potential in the market.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
For example, our CLYC dual mode nuclear detection crystal technology was developed by RMD under a program for the Department of Homeland Security for use in locating nuclear bombs or nuclear materials at our nation’s major cities, ports and borders. This technology has the potential to be very important to our national security, as well as other radiation detection applications, such as nuclear power plant safety. Our dual mode detection crystals have been commercialized in a detector currently being offered by a large manufacturer of detection equipment. RMD continues to further enhance this technology.

Our CLYC dual mode detection crystals technology is designed to be a single detector that replaces two detector subsystems – the gamma radiation detector and also the helium-3 detectors for neutrons. Increasing our value proposition is the fact that the stockpile of the chemical element helium-3, a byproduct of nuclear weapons production, is in short supply. The stockpile of helium-3 has been drawn down during the past 10 years, as the federal government has increased its use in neutron detectors to help prevent nuclear and radiological material from being smuggled into the U.S.
 
Intellectual Property (IP)
 
From October 2016 through September 2017, we have been granted four new U.S. patents and have filed 24 new patent applications. Our current portfolio, company-wide, is 73 issued and 54 pending applications, the largest percentage of which are issued to RMD. We believe that intellectual property represents an important strategic advantage for us.
Customers
 
We have more than 600 customers, with approximately 50% of our business concentrated in our top 10 customers. Our four largest customers are agencies and agents of the Federal government and accounted for approximately 11%, 9%, 6% and 4%, respectively, of our revenues during fiscal year 2017. Our fifth largest customer is a customer of our Optics segment and also accounted for 4% of our overall revenue during fiscal year 2017. The loss of any of these top five customers would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Generally, our customers provide purchase orders for a specific part and quantity or they provide a contract for research projects. Product orders are normally filled over a period ranging from one to six weeks. We also have blanket orders that call for monthly deliveries of predetermined amounts. Contract research projects generally run for a one to two year period.
Employees
 
As of September 30, 2017, we had a total of 204 employees, 191 of which are full-time. Of the total, 30 of our employees are engaged in administration, 10 are engaged in sales, 75 are engaged in research and/or engineering and 89 are engaged in manufacturing. The Company has a total of 27 Ph.D. level employees. Our operations are non-union except for a two-person union in one location.
Suppliers
 
Our largest supplier for materials and components is a supplier of the fused silica material that is fabricated and sold by our New Jersey facility. We believe that we have excellent relationships with our suppliers. If any of our suppliers should become unavailable to us for any reason, we believe that there are a number of potential replacements, although we might incur some delay in identifying such replacements.
Research and Development
 
Our RMD business unit primarily provides research and development (“R&D”) activities under government funded research contracts. The RMD business unit recognized revenue of $18.0 million and $19.8 million in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. The direct costs associated with the research revenue were $10.7 million and $12.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Substantially all the Contract Research segment’s cost of revenue relates to research performed by RMD which are in turn billed to the contracting party.
 
R&D for our other businesses, which totaled approximately $0.9 million and $1.0 million in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively, was primarily new product development, changes to our manufacturing processes and the introduction of improved methods and equipment.
 
Government Regulation
 
The businesses that we operate are subject to various federal and state regulations.

Our Contract Research segment is subject to the rules and regulations applicable to government contracting, including: the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and supplements, which regulate the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts; the Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations; the Procurement Integrity Act, which regulates access to competitor bids and proposal information and government source selection information, and our ability to provide compensation to certain former government officials; the Civil False Claims Act, which provides for substantial civil penalties for violations, including for submission of a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. Government for payment or approval; and the U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. Government contracts.
 
The tissue sealant being developed by Xcede, our joint venture with Mayo Clinic, is subject to FDA regulations and approval in the United States and requires CE marking and other regulatory agency approval in other countries around the world.
 
Our use of radioactive materials in research and certain of our products (our dual-mode detector) subject us to laws regulating hazardous wastes under United States federal and certain state, environmental and atomic energy regulatory laws and similar laws in each jurisdiction in which our research and manufacturing facilities are located. Environmental compliance costs, which totaled $33,000 for fiscal year 2017, have not historically had a material effect on our operating results.
 
With respect to our intellectual property rights, we rely on, and are subject to, the laws in the U.S. and abroad governing intellectual property protection.
