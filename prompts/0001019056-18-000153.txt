The Company believes the reproducibility of scientific studies has become a substantial issue in life science research from drug discovery and development through trials as researchers throughout the world continue to use different protocols for processes associated with sample preparation, cryopreservation and cold chain management. We believe the scientific community is becoming more aware of factors that affect sample integrity and experimental variability. By standardizing handling, storage, and transportation protocols we can substantially improve the quality and reproducibility of our products, and data which will help to accelerate the transition from lab research to drug and therapy development and market launch. To this end, we have licensed affiliates operating on our cellular collection-processing and storage platform in Tokyo, Japan, and Hong Kong. Our licensees purchase our CELLECT adipose tissue collection kits and ACSelerate CP storage consumables from us.
 
Our business strategy is centered on marketing our standardized platform as a complete adipose stem cell (Adult Stem Cells) solution and expanding our research and development through scientific collaborations. We are generating initial revenues through the sale and licensing of our patented products, laboratory tools, and services to capitalize on: (1) ADSC technologies; (2) scientific breakthroughs incorporating ADSCs that have been developing in the fast growing Regenerative and Personalized Medicine industries; (3) providing these growth industries with a standardized ADSC cell processing platform; (4) enhancing the delivery of healthcare through cellular-based therapies and applications which address disease treatment, wound and burn healing, joint repair and personalized health and beauty care; and (5) building a global network of physicians and affiliated laboratory facilities for the delivery of our products and services.
 
Our proprietary, patent pending processing platform allows for the collection, preparation and cryo-preservation of adipose tissue without manipulation, bio-generation or the addition of animal-derived products or other chemical materials which require removal from the tissue sample upon retrieval or prior to use. Management believes this core process makes each tissue sample suitable for use in cosmetic grafting procedures or for further processing to adult stem cells for other types of stem cell therapies. Currently, we believe there are numerous therapeutic and orthopedic applications for adipose tissue and adult stem cell treatments identified or in use globally. As of January 1, 2018, a review of clinicaltrials.gov, operated by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) indicates that there is a significant number of clinical trials registered or completed that are focused on adipose tissue (2387), adult stem cells (5488), adipose derived stem cells (221), mesenchymal stem cells (800), and stromal vascular fraction (83).

Products and Services
 
American CryoStem is focused on multiple high margin business lines capable of generating sustainable, recurring revenue streams from each of our developed products and services. The Company also incorporates its proprietary and patented or patent pending laboratory products, such as our ACSelerate™ cell culture media, into our processing product production and contract manufacturing services. Additionally, the Company requires licensee’s of our tissue and cell processing technologies to purchase all the consumable products required in the collection, processing and storage of tissue/stem cells as part of the licensing agreement including our CELLECT® Validated Collection, Transportation, and Storage System and ACSelerate™ Cell Culture Media Products.
 
To date, we have generated minimal revenue; however, subject to, among other factors, obtaining the requisite financing, management believes that we are well positioned to utilize our developed products and services as the foundation for international distribution through licensees of our technologies and a host of Regenerative Medicine uses and future applications. In the US we operate an FDA registered facility that generates revenue from; the processing and storage of adipose tissue (ATGRAFT), the processing of adipose tissue into its cellular components for future use (ATCELL) and the production and sale of our CELLECT® tissue collection boxes, and patented media products.
 
The products and services are also designed to become an integral part of generating revenue from current and planned licensing territories, our New Jersey based collection, processing and storage operations (CELLECT®) sale and licensing of our developed laboratory products (ACSelerate™  and research grade ATCELL™) , and cellular therapy development activities.
 
CELLECT® Validated Collection, Transportation, and Storage System – An unbreakable “chain of custody” solution for physicians to collect and deliver tissue samples utilizing proprietary and patent pending methods and materials. The CELLECT® service is monitored in real-time and assures the highest cell viability upon laboratory receipt. The CELLECT® system incorporates our ACSelerate–TR™ transport medium into all collection bags which supports the health of the tissue during transport. The CELLECT® kit is an integral part of our validated ATGRAFT™ and ATCELL™ technology to be used by all licensees of our technologies. The CELLECT® service is included in our patent application U.S. Serial No. 13/702,304.
 
American CryoStem is the first tissue bank to globally incorporate through its CELLECT® service the International Blood Banking identification and labeling and product identification coding system. The coding was developed in conjunction with the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB), the American Red Cross and the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT). These groups form the International Council for Commonality in Blood Banking Automation (ICCBBA) and developed the ISBT 128 Standard for machine readable labeling. This labeling system is an acceptable machine readable labeling standard, product description, and bar coding system for FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research under 21 CFR 606.12(c) 13. American CryoStem conforms to this standard in its laboratory facility and all cellular and tissue products produced at the facility carry our W3750 ICCBBA facility identifier allowing any hospital, clinic, laboratory and regulator worldwide to identify the origin and obtain additional information on any sample produced at an American CryoStem facility. The Company will promote this standard in all laboratories that license or utilize our technology.
 
ATGRAFT™ Adipose Tissue Storage Service – A fat storage solution allowing physicians to provide their patients with multiple tissue and cell storage options. The ATGRAFT™ service, through one liposuction procedure allows individuals to prepare for future cosmetic or regenerative procedures by using their own stored adipose tissue as natural biocompatible filler or the components for cellular therapy application without the trauma of further liposuctions. ATGRAFT™ procedures may include breast reconstruction, layered augmentation, buttocks enhancement or volume corrections of the hands, feet, face and neck areas that experience significant adipose tissue (fat) volume reduction as we age. ATGRAFT™ is processed and stored utilizing our standards so that any stored fat tissue sample may be retrieved in the future and re-processed to create stem cells ATCELL™, our cell product for use in Regenerative Medicine applications. The ATGRAFT™ service is included in our pending patent application U.S. Serial No. 13/646,647.
 
The Company’s charges standardized fees for ATGRAFT™ tissue processing and minimum annual storage fees depending on the volume of tissue processed. These processing and storage fees may be paid by the collecting/treating physician or the consumer. The Company earns additional fees paid upon sample retrieval, for the thawing, packaging and shipment of the stored samples to the physician or clinic for immediate use upon receipt. Additionally, physicians may request that any stored ATGRAFT™ tissue sample of 25ml or greater be reprocessed utilizing the Company’s ATCELL™ and Autokine-CM™ processing.
 
The Company believes the ATGRAFT™ service may create patient retention and significant revenue opportunities for the participating physician. The ATGRAFT™ service lowers physician overall costs by eliminating additional liposuction procedures for each scheduled fat transfer or therapy procedure. Physician cost savings may include: materials, supplies, equipment, and the expenses of utilizing a surgical center, hospital operating room or an in-office aseptic procedure room. The ATGRAFT™ service is designed to operate under the minimally manipulated regulations contained in both 21 CFR 1271.10 and PHS 361.

ATCELL™ Adipose Derived Stem Cells (ADSCs) – Processed and characterized adipose derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) created using the Company’s proprietary Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and ACSelerate™ patented cell culture media. ATCELL™ is the Company’s trademarked name for its ADRCs and differentiated cell products and processing methodology. The Company maintains for research purposes multiple master and differentiated cell lines and labels them according to their characterization. (i.e. ATCELL™ (adipose derived stem cells) ATCELL-SVF™ (stromal vascular fraction), ATCELL – CH™ (differentiated chondrocytes) , etc. Cell lines are custom created for patients desiring to store their cells for their own use in future Regenerative Medicine procedures. The Company charges its customers a fee to reprocess previously stored ATGRAFT™ samples and for newly collected client tissue samples to be processed into cellular samples. Customer samples submitted for processing must utilize the CELLECT® collection system and ACSelerate™ mediums to conform to our internal SOPs and quality control standards.
 
The Company believes it will earn additional fees based upon the proposed storage configuration of the final ATCELL™ sample and for future culturing in the ACSelerate™ cell culture and differentiation media. Cell culturing and differentiation can be performed upon receipt of the raw tissue sample or at any time on a previously processed and cryopreserved ATGRAFT™ or ATCELL™ sample. ATCELL™ has shown that it is ideally suited for expansion and differentiation into additional cell types utilizing the ACSelerate™ line of culture and differentiation mediums. The ATCELL™ products and services are incorporated into our pending patent filing US Serial No. 13/646,647.
 
The Company’s ATCELL™ cell lines are processed and cultured in our patented ACSelerate™ –cell culture media. All tissue, cells, and research materials made available for sale to research institutions are tested for sterility, disease, lifespan, and population doubling rate (PDL). Additionally, we believe these cells are suited for any type of cellular therapy or regenerative medicine research. Cell morphology is confirmed by (i) flow cytometry and (ii) differentiation analysis using ACSelerate™ differentiation media. Each ATCELL™ line can be further cultured and differentiated allowing the Company to provide genetically matched grade cell types. We believe this research methodology may provide opportunities for the Company’s ATCELL™ and ACSelerate™ products to become the building blocks of final developed commercial applications.
 
The Company intends to support its cell therapy application research, development and collaborative efforts by making ATCELL™ and ATGRAFT™ samples available for research and product development purposes through joint ventures, and university and commercial collaborations. These adipose tissue and cell line samples, we believe will be sought after by private researchers and universities for use in pre-clinical trial studies and in-vitro research due to our processing methodology, donor sample data and the ability to create multiple cell types that have identical genetic profiles. We believe the processing methods, data collection and testing of our ATCELL™ and the ability to make multiple cell types from the same donor line allows research teams to focus on application development and avoid bench to commercialization delays. The Company is prepared to distribute research samples of its ATCELL™ cell products to users of its ACSelerate™ cell culture media for application development. The Company is investigating new sources of human mesenchymal cell lines for production and distribution to the cellular therapy research market.
 
ACSelerate™ Cell Culture Media Products – Manufactured patented cell culture media products for growing human stromal cells (including all cells found in human skin, fat and other connective tissue). Certain ACSelerate™ cell culture media lines are available in animal serum free, which may be suitable for human and therapeutic uses or a low serum version for application development and research purposes. The patented ACSelerate™ cell culture media line was specifically developed to address increasing industry demand for animal serum-free cell culture products and for the acceleration of products from the laboratory to the patient.


The Company entered into a licensing and manufacturing agreement with PeproTech a life sciences company formed in 1988. PeproTech is the trusted source for the development and manufacturing of high quality cytokine products for the life-science and cell therapy markets.

On August 2, 2011, the Company was issued US patent number 7,989,205 for “Cell Culture Media, Kits and Methods of Use.” The granted claims include media variations for cellular differentiation of ADSCs into osteoblasts (bone), chondrocytes (cartilage), adipocytes (fat), neural cells, and smooth muscles cells in both HSA medium grade and FBS (research) grade. This patent covers both non-GMP research grades and GMP grades suitable for cell culture of adipose-derived stem cells. Additionally, in 2014 the Company filed a continuation of this granted patent with additional claims and improvements, U.S. Serial No. 13/194,900. On November 8, 2016 the Company was granted additional claims from the continuation U.S. Serial No. 13/194,900 issued as a new Patent Serial No. 9,487,755. Prior to the issuance the Company filed a continuation in part (CIP) containing additional claims related to our ongoing media development.
 
Published cell culture research indicates the most widely used cell culture medium for growing and differentiating stem cell cultures for in vitro diagnostics and research contains fetal bovine serum (FBS) and other animal derived products. The use of FBS and other animal products in cellular therapy application development and manufacture raises concerns and generates debates within the scientific and regulatory community relating to potential human/animal cross-contamination. These same concerns may lead to additional expensive and expansive testing and documentation requirements with the FDA during the application and approval process for new cellular therapies manufactured with or containing animal or animal derived products. FDA concerns are evidenced in their Guidance’s and Guidelines regarding cellular therapy involving human cells, tissues and products (HCT/Ps) published and maintained by the FDA. Management believes that eliminating or greatly reducing FBS in cellular manufacturing, applications and products can eliminate or ease these scientific and regulatory concerns and may prove to be a winning strategy for cellular therapy application developers seeking FDA approval.
 
The Company supports its marketing efforts by making ATCELL™ samples available for research purposes and for internal product development through our research programs. We believe these cell lines may be sought after by private researchers and universities for use in pre-clinical trial studies and in-vitro research. We also believe that the Company’s ability to provide these materials for these research and development collaborators, partners and other third parties extends the Company’s ability to become a primary source of grade materials and services necessary to support approved applications and treatments.
 
The Company has created several versions of its ACSelerate™ cell culture media including:
 
· | ACSelerate-MAX™ - xeno serum free cell culture media, 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | ACSelerate-SFM™ - animal serum free cell culture media,;

Each product is genetically unique to the patient and custom blended, deriving its key ingredients from the individual client’s own stem cells. The Company provides its CELLECT® Tissue Collection service to collect the required tissue to manufacture the U-Autologous™ product and processes it under the same Standard Operating Procedures that it developed for the ATGRAFT™ and ATCELL™ cell processing services utilizing ACSelerate™ cell culture media. The Company receives collection, processing and long term storage fees and earns a royalty on all U-Autologous product sales. The utilization of the Company’s core services in its contract manufacturing relationships provides opportunities for the Company to promote ATGRAFT™ and ATCELL™ products.
 
Our Company’s contract manufacturing services can be extended to develop custom and/or white label products and services for both local and global cosmetic and regenerative medicine companies, physicians, wellness clinics and medical spas. The Company intends to expand its relationships and contract manufacturing regionally through its physician networks and globally through its International Licensing Program.
 
International Licensing Program – The Company believes that globally, many jurisdictions outside the US currently permit use of cellular therapies and regenerative medicine applications. The Company has received numerous international inquiries concerning the sale or licensing of our SOPs, products and services in the Regenerative Medicine and Medical Tourism Markets. The Company believes that the inquiries to date are a result of the global boom in Medical Tourism, Regenerative and Personalized Medicine and the slow pace of approval of cellular therapies and regenerative medicine applications in the US. To address the Company’s sales, marketing and branding opportunities globally, the Company has created its international licensing program. To date we have licensed our technologies in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China and, Tokyo, Japan.
 
The Company believes it can take advantage of the significant growth of the global cellular therapy market through its international licensing and marketing efforts. A recently published study by Transparency Market Research predicts that the Stem Cell market will grow at a CAGR of 24.2% upon its value of US $26.23 billion in 2013 and will reach an approximate value of US $119.52 billion by 2019. The report, titled “Stem Cells Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast, 2012 - 2018”; which can be found at (http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2014/12/22/693419/10113247/en/Global-Stem-Cells-Market-to-grow-at-a-CAGR-of-24-2-to-Push-US-119-52-billion-by-2019-Transparency-Market-Research
 
In June of 2015, The Company entered into an initial agreement with CellSource, LTD. (“CellSource”) located in Shibuya, Tokyo Japan for the licensing of our AGRAFT™ tissue processing and storage technology and the purchase of our CELLECT® collection products which include our ACSelerate-TR™ transport medium. The Company also assisted CellSource in upgrading its facility in Japan and provided training in the ATGRAFT™ processing and recordkeeping procedures. CellSource began marketing the new services initially within its existing network of clinics throughout Japan and begin purchasing its CELLECT™ and ACSelerate-CP™ cryoprotectant from the Company in the third quarter of 2015. Upon execution of the Agreement the Company received an upfront payment and will receive additional minimum annual payments, and consumable product sales revenue in future years.
 
Product Development
 Our strategic approach to product development is to design, develop and launch new products and services that utilize our existing products and services, i.e. the use of the CELLECT® collection materials by contracted companies to collect fresh tissue for their product. Management believes that allowing other biotech companies to utilize portions of our platform will provide the Company with additional opportunities to produce near term cash flow, strong recurring revenue streams, strong international licensing partners and complementary scientific data. We focus on developing products, services and applications that require tissue collection and processing as the initial requirement to produce cellular therapies and products. These products and services may include adipose tissue and stem cell sample processing and storage as a form of personal “bio-insurance”, adipose tissue (fat) storage for cosmetic fat engraftment procedures, and the creation of topical applications and ingredients used by other companies in the wound care and cosmetic industries as well as cellular applications and bio-materials development.

During the last quarter of 2015 the Company undertook a review of the collaborative efforts between the Company and Dr. Lee pending the expiration of the agreements in November of 2015. Management believes that potential commercialization of the licensed technologies would require a number of years of additional study and experimentation and substantial investment by the Company. In November of 2015 the Collaboration and Research Agreement and the Licensing Agreement were terminated. 
 Cells on Ice: 
 In August of 2015 the company entered into an Agreement with Cells On Ice, Inc. (COI) located in Los Angeles, California to process adipose tissue and adipose derived cellular samples to study future use in Regenerative Medicine. COI is a network of physicians interested in the development and use of adipose tissue and adipose derived cellular samples in regenerative therapies and cellular medicine. The Company has agreed to distribute its Cellect collection boxes and provide its ATGRAFT™ and ATCELL™ processing services under the COI brand for the collection, processing and storage of tissue samples at its NJ facility. Under the agreement, COI will pay the Company for the processing and storage of each sample generated by COI network physicians. COI plans to seek regulatory approval for use of the stored samples in studies and trials utilizing adipose tissue processed into Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) and ultimately expanded adipose derived mesenchymal adult stem cells. The Company is incorporating its existing protocols into COI’s studies and may provide processing and other data to COI in support of their ongoing efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval of its cellular therapies. COI has initiated several IRB approved studies. This initial work will become the basis for Investigational New Drug and Investigational Device Exemption filings with the FDA.
Additional Collaborations
 The Company recognizes the benefits of collaborations with industry and university partners and continues to seek these relationships. These relationships are generally covered by Confidential Non-Disclosure Agreements and include Material Transfer Agreements (MTA) under which the Company will supply ATCELL™ and/or ACSelerate™ medium products for evaluation, testing, and the development of new cellular therapy applications.
 The Company has entered into Non-Disclosure and Material Transfer Agreements with a number of potential collaborators. No assurance can be given that these efforts or relationships will ultimately result in new technology for future commercialization.
 
Regulatory Information 
 
The Company believes that its processing methodologies and the laboratory facilities are designed to be in compliance with all current regulations as defined by the United States Public Health Service Act (“PHS” or the “PHS Act”) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations as they relate to the operation of a tissue processing and storage facility.
 
The Company’s New Jersey laboratory facility is registered with the FDA (FEI 3008307548) as a processing and storage facility for Human Cells, Tissues and Cellular and Tissue Based Products (HCT/Ps) since 2010. In 2013, we registered the facility with the State of New York (CP169TP136) and the State of California (CNC80948) the only states in the U.S. requiring registration. We have discussed our operations with the State of New Jersey Health Department and Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to ascertain any special regulations to which we may be subject. Based upon these discussions, and our use of a registered medical waste disposal company, we do not at this time have any special registrations or regulations for compliance with the State of New Jersey.
 
Our SOPs are the key to properly operating our tissue processing facility. To ensure delivery of the highest quality services, we incorporate these SOPs, which are designed to provide a basis for accreditation by the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB), the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB) and the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT-JACIE). We have consistently endeavored to ensure that our processes, methodologies and procedures remain among the highest standards in the global tissue collection, processing and storage market. To this end, we have equipped ourselves with state-of-the-art quality processing and testing equipment, which we believe helps to ensure that every sample collected and processed is sterile (free from adventitious agents), viable and capable of significant cellular growth and expansion.

Quality Management
 
The Company’s quality management program attempts to ensure that during processing and testing of each adipose tissue or SVF sample, the appropriate quality management tests and processing methodologies are performed and the data is collected, recorded and reviewed by the laboratory management team.
Chain of Custody Control
 
Central to the individual sample testing is an unbroken chain of custody and tracking. Sample tracking begins with the creation of each collection box. All samples, processing, quality management, batch, and storage documents and records, are coded with this unique number. All records and testing samples are cross referenced and verified as required by the standard operating procedures.
Testing Design and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
 
Testing methods are standardized and operate under a complete set of SOPs and Quality Management (QM) processes. All SOPs are designed to be in compliance with the US Food and Drug Administration’s regulations and guidance for aseptic processing. Strict QM is enforced to avoid and/or record any process deviations.
Intellectual Property

 The program is designed to permit the licensing of the Company’s products and services to organizations that meet the Company’s financial and technical criteria. The licensing program allows for a variety of business relationship including franchising, partnering and joint venturing. Marketing efforts to date have been to clinics, physician and hospitals in foreign jurisdictions capable of rapidly building or committing the appropriate facilities and personnel to create the required laboratory facilities to operate the CELLECT®, ATGRAFT™ and ATCELL™ services in their local market. Strategically, the Company’s international licensees will maintain the branding of the Company’s services along the lines of the “Intel Inside” branding program.
 Qualified Licensees can quickly take advantage of the rapidly expanding opportunity to collect, process, store and culture individual regenerative cell samples for their clients with the comfort and confidence that they are providing services that have been developed to conform to US FDA standards. Core to the relationship is the developed proprietary and patent pending processing and laboratory operational methodologies contained in our Standard Operating Procedures, Training, and Continuous Quality Management, Testing Program, and Laboratory Operations manuals.
 Licensing programs may be initiated through a letter of intent (LOI) agreement between the Company and the prospective licensee. This LOI agreement is designed for due diligence and facility qualifications purposes. The Company may receive an initial fee under the agreement which may or may not be credited toward future royalty payments. Following evaluation of the prospective licensee the Company will enter into a final Agreement which outlines all upfront fees, minimum royalties and consumable purchase obligations of the Licensee.
