Item 1. | BUSINESS

In this annual report on Form 10-K, “USG,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to USG Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements, except as otherwise indicated or as the context otherwise requires.
General
USG, through our subsidiaries and joint ventures, is a leading manufacturer of building materials and innovative solutions that was originally formed in 1902. We produce a wide range of products for use in new residential, new nonresidential, and residential and nonresidential repair and remodel construction as well as products used in certain industrial processes. Our businesses are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including, in particular, conditions in the North American housing and construction-based markets. Our expansion through two 50/50 joint ventures we formed in 2014 with Boral Limited, referred to as USG Boral Building Products, or UBBP, into the markets of Asia, Australasia, and the Middle East has significantly increased our exposure to the economic conditions in those areas. 
The effects of market conditions on our operations are discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Segments
During the fourth quarter of 2017, we realigned our operating structure to reflect changes in our organizational structure and management's operation and view of our businesses. Our realigned operating structure is generally aligned by product type and consists of three divisions, in addition to UBBP: Gypsum, Performance Materials and Ceilings. The operations of the divisions are similar throughout North America.
As a result of our realigned operating structure, we changed the composition of our reportable segments effective for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 to align with how we manage our businesses, review operating performance and allocate resources considering the discrete information available for the geographies within those divisions. We now have five reportable segments: U.S. Wallboard and Surfaces, U.S. Performance Materials, U.S. Ceilings, Canada, and UBBP. Our prior period results have been recast to reflect these changes and present comparative year over year information by segment. See Note 14, Segments, to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for financial information regarding our reportable segments.
Our reportable segments are determined considering both qualitative and quantitative metrics for aggregation of the product type within geographies for which discrete financial information is available. Our U.S. Wallboard and Surfaces, U.S. Performance Materials and U.S. Ceilings reportable segments were identified based on products manufactured and marketed as discussed below. Our Canada segment is a separately reportable segment, as while it has similar qualitative factors to U.S. operations, it has different quantitative metrics and, therefore, cannot be aggregated. Our operating segments in Mexico and Latin America, as well as our mining operation in Little Narrows, Nova Scotia, Canada, which we indefinitely idled in 2016, and our shipping company, which we exited in 2015, are now included in Other as reconciling items to our consolidated segments. There has been no change to our UBBP segment.

The following graph reflects the breakdown by segment of our 2017 consolidated net sales of $3.2 billion.

Net sales of UBBP of $1.2 billion are excluded from the graph above as the joint ventures are accounted for as equity method investments. 
Gypsum
BUSINESS
Our Gypsum division manufactures and markets gypsum and related products in the United States, Canada and Mexico. It is composed of our U.S. Wallboard and Surfaces segment and the Gypsum operations of our Canada segment. Our Gypsum operations in Mexico do not rise to the level of a reportable segment and thus are included in Other. We are the largest manufacturer of gypsum wallboard in the United States and accounted for approximately 25.4% of total industry shipments of gypsum board in 2017. The gypsum board market, as determined by the Gypsum Association, includes gypsum wallboard, other gypsum-related paneling products and imports. As such, we've included the Gypsum products of USG Sheetrock® brand gypsum wallboard and Securock® brand glass mat sheathing and the Performance Materials product of Fiberock® brand gypsum fiber panels in our estimate of our market share of the gypsum board market. In Canada, we accounted for approximately 42% of Canadian domestic shipments of gypsum wallboard in 2017 and are the largest manufacturer of gypsum wallboard in Canada. 
PRODUCTS
Gypsum's products are used in a variety of building applications to construct walls and ceilings of residential, nonresidential and institutional buildings, as well as in certain industrial applications. We also produce gypsum-based products for agricultural and industrial customers to use in a wide variety of applications, including soil conditioning, road repair, fireproofing and ceramics. The major product lines within the Gypsum division are:

WALLBOARD 
USG Sheetrock® brand gypsum wallboard and Securock® brand glass mat sheathing portfolios | Gypsum panels that provide aesthetic as well as sound-dampening, fire-retarding, abuse-resistance and moisture-control value 
SURFACES 
USG Sheetrock® brand joint compound portfolio, as well as corner bead, joint tape, and plaster | Used for finishing wallboard joints

MANUFACTURING
Our Gypsum division manufactures products at 41 plants located throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico, some of which are shared with the Performance Materials division.
Gypsum rock is mined or quarried at 12 company-owned locations in North America. Our mines and quarries provided approximately 50% of the gypsum used by our plants in North America in 2017. Some of our manufacturing plants purchase or acquire synthetic gypsum and natural gypsum rock from outside sources. In 2017, outside sources of synthetic gypsum and natural gypsum rock accounted for approximately 43% and 7%, respectively, of the gypsum used in our North American plants. 
Synthetic gypsum is a byproduct of flue gas desulphurization carried out by electric generation or industrial plants that burn coal as a fuel. The suppliers of this kind of gypsum are primarily power companies, which are required to operate scrubbing equipment for their coal-fired generating plants under federal environmental regulations. We have entered into a number of long-term supply agreements to acquire synthetic gypsum. Certain power companies have switched to using natural gas instead of coal for their electric generation needs. In the event more power companies switch to using natural gas instead of coal, the availability of synthetic gypsum may decrease which could result in an increase to our cost. See Item 1A, Risk Factors.
We produce wallboard paper at four company-owned production facilities located in the United States. Vertical integration in paper helps to ensure a continuous supply of high-quality paper that is tailored to the specific needs of our production processes. We augment our paper needs through purchases from outside suppliers when necessary. We did not make any material purchases of paper from outside suppliers in 2017.
MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
Our Gypsum products are marketed and distributed through specialty wallboard distributors, building materials dealers, home improvement centers and other retailers and contractors. Sales of Gypsum products are seasonal in the sense that sales are generally greater from spring through autumn than during the remaining part of the year.
Based on our estimates using publicly available data, internal surveys and industry shipment data for gypsum board, as reported by the Gypsum Association, we estimate that during 2017 volume demand for gypsum board was generated by:

• | residential and nonresidential repair and remodel activity of about 51%,


• | new residential construction of about 39%,


• | new nonresidential construction of about 7%, and


• | other activities, such as exports and temporary construction, of about 3%.

COMPETITION
Industry shipments of gypsum board in the United States (including gypsum wallboard, other gypsum-related paneling products and imports), as reported by the Gypsum Association, were an estimated 25.7 billion square feet in 2017, up approximately 3% from 25.0 billion square feet in 2016. Our share of the gypsum board market in the United States, which includes for comparability shipments of USG Sheetrock® brand gypsum wallboard, Fiberock® brand gypsum fiber panels and Securock® brand glass mat sheathing, increased to 25.4% in 2017 from 24.6% in 2016.

Other Information
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
To contribute to our high standards and our leadership in the building materials industry, we perform extensive research and development at the USG Corporate Innovation Center in Libertyville, Illinois, using open innovation models and outside partnerships. Research team members collaborate with suppliers, universities and national research laboratories to provide product support and to develop new products and technologies for our divisions. With fire, acoustical, structural and environmental testing capabilities, the research center allows us to conduct our own on-site evaluation of products and systems. Chemical analysis and materials characterization support product development and safety/quality assessment programs. Development activities can be taken to an on-site pilot plant before being transferred to a full-size plant. Research and development activities have been focused on customer preferred system solutions. We expense research and development expenditures as incurred. These expenditures amounted to $23 million, $24 million and $23 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. UBBP also operates a research and development center in Thailand. 
SUSTAINABILITY
The adoption of green building codes and standards such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED, rating system established by the U.S. Green Building Council to encourage the design and construction of buildings that are environmentally friendly, combined with an increase in customer preference for products that can assist in obtaining LEED credit or are otherwise environmentally preferable, has increased demand for products, systems and services that contribute to building sustainable spaces. Many of our products meet the requirements for the awarding of LEED credits, and we continue to develop new products and systems to address market demand for products that enable construction of buildings that require fewer natural resources to build, operate and maintain. Our competitors also have developed and introduced to the market more environmentally responsible products.
We expect that there will be increased demand over time for products, systems and services that meet regulatory and customer sustainability standards and preferences and decreased demand for products that produce significant greenhouse gas emissions. We also believe that our ability to continue to provide these products and systems to our customers will be necessary to maintain our competitive position in the marketplace.
ENERGY
Our primary supplies of energy have been adequate, and we have not been required to curtail operations as a result of insufficient supplies. Supplies are likely to remain sufficient for our projected requirements. Currently, we are using swap 
6

contracts to hedge a significant portion of our anticipated purchases of natural gas to be used in our manufacturing operations over the next 12 months and beyond. We review our positions regularly and make adjustments as market conditions warrant.
SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS
On a worldwide basis, for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, The Home Depot accounted for 23%, 23% and 23% of our net consolidated sales, respectively, and L&W Supply Corporation, or L&W, accounted for 16%, 19% and 18% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. On October 31, 2016, we completed the sale of L&W to American Builders & Contractors Supply Co., Inc., or ABC Supply, for $675 million inclusive of the final working capital adjustment. Additionally, we entered into a supply agreement with L&W that governs sales of wallboard and certain other products from USG to L&W. Our U.S. Wallboard and Surfaces, U.S. Performance Materials, U.S. Ceilings and Canada segments each had net sales to these customers in each of those years. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We consider patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success. We hold numerous patents and have registered numerous trademarks of varying duration in multiple legal jurisdictions. Further, we have filed patent applications and applications for the registration of trademarks in the United States and internationally. Although we consider our patents, licenses and trade secrets to constitute valuable assets, we do not regard any of our businesses as being materially dependent upon individual patents, trade secrets, or licenses.
OTHER
Because we generally fill orders upon receipt, no segment has any significant order backlog.
None of our segments has any special working capital requirements.
No material part of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of any government.
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 6,800 employees worldwide in our consolidated operations.
See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for financial information pertaining to net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region and net sales, operating profit and total assets by reportable segment. Our prior period results have been recast to reflect the changes to our reportable segments noted above and present comparative year over year information.
