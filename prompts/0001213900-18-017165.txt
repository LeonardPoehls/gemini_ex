Background and History of BVI-ACM and China-ACMH 
 
BVI-ACM was established on October 9, 2007, under the laws of British Virgin Islands. The majority shareholders of BVI-ACM are Chinese citizens who own 100% of Xin Ao, a limited liability company formed under laws of China. BVI-ACM was established as a “special purpose vehicle” for foreign fund raising for Xin Ao. China State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, requires the owners of any Chinese companies to obtain SAFE’s approval before establishing any offshore holding company structure for foreign financing as well as subsequent acquisition matters. On September 29, 2007, BVI-ACM was approved by local Chinese SAFE as a “special purpose vehicle” offshore company. 
 
On November 23, 2007, BVI-ACM established a subsidiary, China-ACMH, in China as a wholly owned foreign limited liability company with registered capital of $5 million. Through China-ACMH and its variable interest entity Xin Ao, we are engaged in producing general ready-mixed concrete, customized mechanical refining concrete, and some other concrete-related products which are mainly sold in China. On September 20, 2010, China ACMH established a 100% owned subsidiary, Advanced Investment Holdings Co., Inc., or AIH, in the State of Nevada. AIH never engaged in operations and the Company subsequently dissolved AIH on August 30, 2011.


In March and April 2010, Xin Ao established five 100% owned subsidiaries in China: Beijing Heng Yuan ZhengKe Technical Consulting Co., Ltd (“Heng Yuan ZhengKe”), Beijing Hong Sheng An Construction Materials Co., Ltd (“Hong Sheng An”), Beijing Heng Tai Hong Sheng Construction Materials Co., Ltd (“Heng Tai”), Da Tong Ao Hang Wei Ye Machinery and Equipment Rental Co., Ltd (“Da Tong”) and Luan Xian HengXin Technology Co., Ltd (“Luan Xian HengXin”). Total registered capital for these five subsidiaries was approximately $2.1 million (RMB 14 million) and none of these Xin Ao subsidiaries had actual operation. In February 2017 and prior, all five subsidiaries were dissolved.
 
Our Business

Our concrete sales business is comprised of the formulation, production and delivery of the Company’s line of C10-C100 concrete mixtures primarily through our current fixed plant, a ready mix concrete batching plant in Beijing. The ready-mixed concrete sales business engages principally in the formulation, preparation and delivery of ready-mixed concrete to the worksites of our customers. We procure raw materials, mix them according to our measured mixing formula, ship the final products in mounted transit mixers to the destination work site, and, for more sophisticated structures, pump the mixture and set it into structural frame molds as per structural design parameters. The process of delivering and setting the ready mix concrete mixture cannot exceed 90 minutes because the chemistry of concrete mixture hardens thereafter. The deliverable radius of a concrete mixture from our ready mix plant in Beijing is approximately 25 kilometers. Traffic conditions would affect the timing and shipment of our concrete mixtures. Since the 2008 Olympics, there are alternating license plate traffic restrictions on many traffic routes in Beijing to ease traffic congestion and associated exhaust pollution. Due to the large amounts of working capital required for the acquisition of raw materials, a supply shortage or degradation of supplier accounts payable credit terms would pose a potential risk to our business.


Our principal market, Beijing, has enjoyed stronger economic growth and a higher demand for construction than other regions of China. As a result, we have witnessed that competitors expanding their sales and build up their distribution networks in our principal market. We anticipate that this trend will continue and likely accelerate. Increased competition may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operation results.

Our Industry
 
China is already among the world’s largest construction materials producers, ranking first in the world’s annual output of cement, flat glass, building ceramic and ceramic sanitary ware. The construction materials market includes all manufacturers of sand, gravel, aggregates, cement, concrete and bricks. The market does not include other finished or semi-finished building materials.
 
Our Industry was influenced by the decline in the macro economy in recent periods. The concrete products industry experienced a slowdown in industry production and economic growth since September 2011. In 2014, the slowdown in the industry became more obvious month by month, with profit generally being squeezed by the greater pressure to maintain stable level of production and operation.
 
Demand for Ready-Mixed Concrete 
 
The demand for ready-mixed concrete is substantially effected by the economy scale, number of ongoing infrastructure projects as well as the environmental policies in China. Recently, the fixed asset investment has been slowed down in China and it actually causes a negative growth in the real estate investment industry. Meanwhile, China has strengthened its environmental protection, about 26.6% concrete companies have gone through a production suspension in 2017. The growth rate of the concrete product industry declined 21% based on a ten-month comparison (January to October) from 2017 to 2018. For this same period, the increase rate of sales in concrete industry has also suffered a year decline of about 22% by taking the increase of commodity price into consideration. Therefore, the demand of ready-mixed concrete in China may have a tendency of decrease in near future.

Our Competitive Strengths 
 
Ready-mixed concrete is a highly versatile construction material that results from combining coarse and fine aggregates, such as gravel, crushed stone and sand, with water, various chemical admixtures and cement. We manufacture ready-mixed concrete in variations, which in each instance may reflect a specific design use. We generally maintain inventory of raw materials for a short period of time to coordinate our daily material purchases with the time-sensitive delivery requirements of our customers.
 
The quality of ready-mixed concrete is time-sensitive as it becomes difficult to place within hours after mixing. Consequently, the market for a permanently installed ready-mixed concrete plant is usually limited to an area within a certain radius of such plant’s location. We produce ready-mixed concrete in batches at our plant and use mixer and other trucks to complete the production process, then distribute and deliver the concrete to the worksites of our customers.
 
Concrete has many attributes that make it a highly versatile construction material. In recent years, industry participants have developed various uses for concrete products.
 
We generally obtain contracts through local sales and marketing efforts directed at concrete subcontractors, general contractors, property owners and developers, governmental agencies and home builders.
 
Our competitors includes a number of state-owned and large private PRC-based manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours. We compete primarily on the basis of quality, technological innovation and price. Essentially all contracts on which we bid are awarded through a competitive bid process with awards often made to the lowest bidder, though other factors such as shorter completion time or prior experiences are often just as important. Within our markets, we compete with many national, regional and local state-owned and private construction corporations, some of which have achieved greater market penetration or have greater financial and other resources than us. In addition, there are a number of large national companies in our industry that could potentially enter into our markets and compete with us. If we are unable to compete successfully in our markets, our relative market share and profits would be reduced.
 
We believe that the following competitive strengths enable us to compete effectively and to capitalize on the remaining market for construction materials in China:
 

● | Large Scale Contractor Relationships. We have contracts with major construction contractors which are constructing key infrastructure, commercial and residential projects. Our sales efforts focus on large-scale projects and large customers which place large recurring orders and raise less credit risk to us. For the year ended June 30, 2018, five customers accounted for approximately 36.3% of the Company’s sales and 26.6% of the Company’s accounts receivable as of June 30, 2018. Should we lose these customers in the future and are unable to obtain additional customers, our revenues will suffer. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Experienced Management. The technical knowledge and business relationships of our management give us the ability to secure major infrastructure projects, increase production volumes, and implement quality standards and environmentally sensitive policies, and it also provide us with leverage to acquire less sophisticated operators. If there is any significant turnover in our management, we would lose the institutional knowledge held by our existing senior management team. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Innovation Efforts. We strive to produce the most technically and scientifically advanced products for our customers hence we maintain close relationships with Tsinghua University, Xi’an University of Architecture and Technology and Beijing Dongfang Jianyu Institute of Concrete Science &Technology, which assist us with our research and development activities. During our five year agreement with the Institute, we obtain an advantageous status over many of our competitors by gaining access to a wide array of resources and knowledge. The Company incurred research & development expenses of approximately $1.2 million and $0.8 million for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy 
 
We are committed to enhancing profitability and cash flows through the following strategies:
 

● | Focusing on High Capacity Utilization. We intend to focus on achieving high capacity utilization in order to efficiently operate our plant, by increasing capacity utilization at our existing plant or expanding capacity by building new plants to meet existing contracts and anticipated increase in demand. As a result, we terminated our leased station in the eastern suburban area of Beijing based on slowing demand for railway construction and the suspension of new and ongoing high speed railway projects stemming from a changing policy announced by China’s Ministry of Rail and national development and reform commission.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Mergers and Acquisitions. When capital permits, we intend to capitalize on the challenges that smaller companies are encountering in our industry by acquiring complementary companies at favorable prices. We believe that buying rather than building capacity is an option that may be attractive to us if replacement costs are higher than purchase prices. We continue to look into acquiring smaller concrete manufacturers in China as part of our expansion plans. We have not identified specific targets or entered into any Letters-of-Intent at this time.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Vertical Integration. When capital permits, we plan to acquire smaller companies within the construction industry, develop more material recycling centers, and hire additional highly qualified employees. In order to accomplish this, we may need to offer additional equity or debt securities. Certain companies we seek to acquire are suppliers of the raw materials we purchase to manufacture our products. If we do acquire such companies we will have greater control over our raw material costs. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Supply Chain Efficiencies and Scale. We intend to streamline our supply chain process and leverage our scale. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | New Product Offerings. We plan to produce a lightweight aggregate concrete for use in projects and to expand product offerings to include pre-cast concrete.

Our Operations 
 
We provide materials through our ready-mixed concrete plant in Beijing. We own one concrete plant and its related equipment.
 
Products 
 
As architectural designs become more complex, challenging, and modern in scope, the need for technology driven companies to provide high-end specialty concrete mixtures has rapidly accelerated. Increasing demand for state-of-the-art cement mixtures has spurred our technological innovation and our ability to provide advanced mixtures of building materials that meet project specific engineering and environmental specifications. We produce a range of C10 to C100 concrete materials and specialize in an array of specialized ready-mixed concretes tailored to each project’s technical specifications and environmental standards.
 
We specialize in “ready-mixed concrete”, a concrete mixture made at our facility with complete computerized operating systems. Such concrete accounts for nearly three-fourths of all concrete produced. Ready-mixed concrete is mixed on demand and is shipped to worksites by concrete mixer trucks.
 
Our ready-mixed concrete products consist of proportioned mixes we prepare and deliver in an unhardened plastic state for placement and shaping into designed forms at the worksite. Selecting the optimum mix for a worksite entails determining not only the ingredients with the desired permeability, strength, appearance and other properties after it hardened, but also the ingredients necessary to achieve a workable consistency considering the weather and other conditions at the worksite. We believe we can achieve product differentiation for the mixes we offer because of the variety of mixes we produce, our volume production capacity and our scheduling, delivery and placement reliability.
 
We produce ready-mixed concrete by combining the desired type of cement, other cementitious materials and gravel and crushed stone with water and, typically, one or more admixtures. These admixtures, such as chemicals, minerals and fibers, determine the usefulness of the product for particular applications.
 
We use a variety of chemical admixtures to relieve internal pressure, increase resistance to crack in subfreezing weather, retard the hardening process to make concrete more workable in hot weather, strengthen concrete by reducing its water content, accelerate the hardening process, reduce the time required for curing, and facilitate the placement of concrete acquiring low water content.

We frequently use various mineral admixtures as supplements to cement, which we refer to as cementitious materials, to alter the permeability, strength and other properties of concrete.
 
The ready-mixed concrete sector in the market is growing at a fast rate, largely due to the Chinese government’s implementation of Decree #341 in 2004. This law bans on-site concrete production in over 200 cities across China, with the goal of reducing environmental damages from onsite concrete mixing and improving the quality of concrete used in construction. The use of ready-mix concrete minimizes worksite noise, dirt and congestion, and most additives used in ready-mix concrete are environmentally safe. Our goal is to continue the use of at least 30% recyclable components in our concrete mixtures. 
 
We are building a comprehensive product portfolio that serves the diverse needs of our developing customer base and all unique construction and infrastructure projects. While we mainly specialize in ready-mix concrete formulations from controlled low-strength material to high-strength concrete, each of them is specifically formulated to meet the needs of each project. We provide both industry standard and highly innovative products, including:



Common Industry Mixtures | Industry Leading Mixtures 
--------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------
(Customized to Project) | Highly Technical Blends 
Ready-mixed Concrete Blends: C10 to C100 | Compound Admixture Concrete 
Controlled Low-Strength Material (CLSM) | Lightweight Aggregate Concrete 
High-Strength Concrete with Customized Fibers | Energy-saving Phase change thermostat concrete 
Soil Cement, Unique Foundation Concrete | C100 High Performance Concrete 

Our Customers 

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, we had one customer, whose sales accounted for more than 10% of our total sales. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, we had one customer, whose sales accounted for more than 10% of our total sales. Five customers accounted for approximately 39.9% and 30.0% of the Company’s sales for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The total accounts receivable from these customers amounted to approximately $10.2 million and $13.5 million as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Developing New Relationships
 
Our business will be damaged if project contracts with the Chinese government, for which we may act as a sub-contractor, are cancelled. Our sales strategy balances these risks by focusing on building new long-term cooperative relationships with some of China’s top construction companies in order to enhance our reputation and to enter new markets. Our sales representatives are actively building relationships with the Chinese government, general contractors, architects, engineers, and other potential sources of new business in target markets. Our sales efforts are further supported by our executive officers and engineering personnel, who have substantial experience in the design, formulation and implementation of advanced construction and concrete materials projects.
Our Suppliers

We rely on third party suppliers of the raw materials to manufacture our products. Our top five suppliers accounted for approximately 36% and 48% of the Company’s purchases for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The total accounts payable to these suppliers amounted to approximately $0.7 million and $4.5 million as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Sales and Marketing 
 
General contractors typically select their suppliers of ready-mixed concrete and precast concrete. In large, complex projects, an engineering firm or division within a state transportation or public works department, may influence the purchasing decision, particularly if the concrete has complicated design specifications. In connection with large, complex projects and government-funded projects, the general contractor or project engineer usually awards supply orders on the basis of either direct negotiation or a competitive bidding process. Our marketing efforts target on general contractors, developers, design engineers, architects and homebuilders whose focus extends beyond the price of our products to quality, consistency and reducing the in-place cost.
 
Our marketing efforts are geared toward advancing China-ACMH as the supplier to build China’s most modern and challenging projects. The Company is constantly seeking ways to raise its profile and leverage additional publicity. To this end, the Company plans to expand its presence at leading construction industry events and in periodicals to build up successful reputation. The primary goal is to reinforce the sales efforts by promoting positive testimonials and successful stories from the Company’s high profile clients and projects. Our marketing and sales strategy emphasizes on the sale of value-added products and solutions to customers.
 
Research and Development 
 
Construction materials companies are under extreme pressure to respond quickly to industrial demands with new designs and product innovations that support rapidly changing technical demand and regulatory requirements. We devote a substantial amount of attention to the research and development of advanced construction materials that meet the specific needs of projects while striving to lead the industry in value, materials and processes. We have sophisticated in-house R&D and testing facilities, a highly technical onsite team, in cooperation with a leading research institution, experienced management and advisory experts. Our research and development expenses were approximately $1.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $0.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017.
Beijing Concrete Institute Partnership 
 
The Beijing Dongfang Jianyu Institute of Concrete Science & Technology, or Beijing Concrete Institute, has 40 employees, with five senior research fellows, and 15 mid-level researchers.

Successful Innovations

Some of our advanced products and processes are developed through our relationships with research institutes and universities, including:
 
C100 High Performance Concrete 
 
High Strength Concrete is often defined as concrete with a compressive strength greater than 6000 psi (41 MPa). The primary difference between high-strength concrete and normal-strength concrete is the compressive strength that represent the maximum resistance of a concrete sample to applied pressure. Manufacturing high-strength concrete involves making optimal use of the basic ingredients that constitute normal-strength concrete.
 
Through our collaborative efforts, we have developed a high performance concrete which can be produced at an impermeable grade above P35, and can be used as self-waterproofing concrete for structural engineering, as the water-cement (W/C) ratio and carbonized shrinking is minimal and the structure is close-grained.
 
Only a limited number of corporations in the Beijing are equipped with the expertise to produce C100 High Performance Concrete.
 
Compound Admixture Concrete 
 
This compound mineral mixture is a composite of coal powder, mineral powder and mineral activators blended to specific proportions. This mixture improves activity, filling, and super-additive effects of the concrete and also improves the compatibility between cement and aggregate.
Lightweight Aggregate Concrete & Innovative Pumping Technology 
 
This procedure involves a pumping technology of lightweight aggregate. It is a pretreatment method of lightweight aggregate. Setting appropriate times and pressure, lightweight aggregate will reach an appropriate saturation state under pressure once it is put into a custom designed sealed pressure vessel. Lightweight aggregate concrete was prepared through the above pretreatment method, and would dry quicker under pumping pressure without losing consistency. Accordingly, lightweight aggregate concrete will be easily pumped when applied which shortens the construction time.
Energy-saving Technologies of Phase Change Thermostat Concrete 
 
Energy conservation concrete may adjust and reflect process temperature, which would solve cracking problem brought about by cement heat of hydration in large-scale concrete pours.
 
Polycarboxylate Series High Performance Water Reducing Agent Compositing Technique 
 
The research and production of water reducing admixture would improve performance while lowering pollution and the environmental impact. Super plasticizer Polycarboxylate series which reduces water requirements is an attractive additive in that it enables high strength concrete, super-strength concrete, high fluidity and super plasticizer concrete, and self-defense concrete. The water reduction of Polycarboxylate may reach 20% to 25%, higher than the current industry standard -- the Naphthaline water reducing agent. The cost of the water reducing agent is highly competitive, as it may replace Naphthaline to be used for high strength and high performance concrete production.
Application of Reused Water in Concrete 
 
The re-use of waste water of a concrete plant to mix concrete is significant as it can reduce production costs, minimize fresh water usage and introduce an efficient approach to address industrial waste. The practical application of this effort is a further step towards the goal of minimal pollution and emissions.

Our Competition 
 
Our principal market, Beijing, has enjoyed stronger economic growth and a higher demand for construction than other regions of China. As a result, we believe that competitors will try to expand their sales and build up their distribution networks in Beijing. Our future success depends on our ability to establish and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace.
 
We compete primarily on the basis of quality, technological innovation and price. Our main competitors include Beijing Construction Engineering Group, BBMG Group Co., LTD, Beijing Uni-Construction Group., and Jidong Concrete Group. Essentially all of the contracts we bid on are awarded through a competitive bid process with awards generally made to the lowest bidder, though other factors such as shorter completion time or prior experience are often just as important. Within our markets, we compete with many national, regional and local construction corporations. Some of these competitors have achieved greater market penetration or have greater financial and other resources than us. In addition, we compete with a number of state-owned enterprises, which have significantly greater financial resources and competitive advantage than us.


There are approximately100 concrete mixture stations in the Beijing area. The concrete production industry is highly segmented, with no single supplier having greater than a 3% market share.

Environmental Matters 
 
We are obligated to comply with environmental protection laws and regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Construction and the State Environmental Protection Administration. Some specific environmental regulations require sealed transportation of dust materials and final products, closed storage of sand and gravel, as well as reduction of noise and dust pollution on worksites and encouragement of the use of waste materials. The governmental regulatory authorities conduct periodic inspections. We have met all the requirements in the past inspections. We are one of the 10 companies in the industry that have been awarded the honor of “Green Concrete Producer” by the PRC government.
Regulation

The Company has been in compliance with all registrations and requirements for the issuance and maintenance of all licenses and certificates required by the applicable governing authorities, including the Ministry of Construction and the Beijing Administration of Industry & Commerce. The Ministry of Construction awards Level II and Level III qualifications to concrete producers in the PRC construction industry, based on criteria such as production capacity, technical qualifications, registered capital and capital equipment, as well as performance on their past projects. Level II companies are licensed to produce concrete of all strength levels as well as special concretes, and Level III producers are licensed to produce concrete with strength level C60 and below. We are currently a Level II concrete producer.
 
Additionally, to make improvements at our currently existing plant, we do not need to apply for regulatory approval. However, should we build new concrete plants, we will need to (i) apply for a business license from the local Administration of Industry and Commerce, (ii) receive environmental approval from the local Environmental Protection Bureau in the relevant district area, and (iii) apply for an Industry Qualification Certificate from the local Municipal Construction Committee. The time estimated to receive each of these approvals is approximately one month. In the past, we have not been rejected by any of these three regulators for approval.
 
Our Labor Force 
 
As of June 30, 2018, we employed 269 full-time employees. The following table sets forth the number of our full-time employees by function as of June 30, 2018.

Proposed Re-domicile
 
On September 26, 2018, we filed a definitive proxy statement to change our place of incorporation from Nevada to the Cayman Islands. The re-domicile is expected to involve the Company’s merger with a newly formed subsidiary, as a result of which we will become a wholly owned subsidiary of a Cayman Islands holding company (“CADC Cayman”). It is expected that each outstanding share of common stock of the Company will be converted into the right to receive one ordinary share of CADC Cayman, which will be issued by CADC Cayman in connection with the merger pursuant to a registered offering. Following the merger, CADC Cayman, together with its subsidiaries, is expected to own and continue to conduct the Company’s business in substantially the same manner as is currently being conducted by the Company and its subsidiaries. While CADC Cayman will be taxed as a United States corporation, it is expected to qualify as a foreign private issuer for purposes of its reporting obligations with the SEC, which we expect will reduce our compliance operating costs. The ordinary shares of CADC Cayman are expected to be listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market.
Restatement and Independent Investigation
 
On October 6, 2018, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with the Company’s then independent registered public accounting firm, Friedman LLP (“Friedman”) concluded, that the Company’s audited financial statements at and for the period ended June 30, 2017 contained in the Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K originally filed with the SEC on September 28, 2018 as well as the unaudited financial statements at and for the periods ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 contained in the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q originally filed on November 15, 2017, February 13, 2018 and May 15, 2018, respectively, should no longer be relied upon. The Company’s review of the above mentioned filings revealed that the financial statements in such filings contained errors primarily as a result of omission of certain contingencies.


As a result of such review, the Company has decided to restate the financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as well as those for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017.
 
As a result of the errors described above, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the ends of each of the applicable restatement periods.

In connection with above finding, the Audit Committee commenced an independent investigation into the reasons that led to the Company’s conclusion that the previously filed financials should no longer be relied upon. Specially, the Audit Committee engaged an independent investigation team to investigate the circumstances surrounding errors in Company’s financial statements, which primarily resulted from the omission of certain actual and contingent legal liabilities. The investigation concluded in mid-November 2018. The investigation team found several reasons that appear to have caused, or contributed to, the failures to promptly identify and disclose the legal proceedings and contingencies, including, 1) the Head of the Legal Department’s significant lack of understanding of the important of timely disclosure of legal proceedings and the Legal Department’s problematic decision-making process with regard to reporting of legal proceedings; 2) the Company’s lack of accounting personnel trained in U.S. GAAP; 3) the Company’s need for a full-time CFO; 4) the ongoing lack of communication and coordination between executive management and the various departments within the Company; and 5) the Company’s failures to timely address significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company is in the process of conducting a comprehensive review of the issues identified by the investigation team and intends to take all remedial measures recommended by the Audit Committee within its resources to cure the material weaknesses in its internal and disclosure control procedures. 
 
Matters relating to or arising from the Audit Committee investigation and the associated material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting, including adverse publicity, have caused us to incur significant legal, accounting and other professional fees and other costs, have exposed us to greater risks associated with other civil litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions, have diverted resources and attention that would otherwise be directed toward our operations and implementation of our business strategy and may have impacted our ability to attract and retain customers, employees and vendors.
