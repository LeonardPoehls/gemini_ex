The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving entity (the Merger). TCT Holdings will (subject to TIAA’s right under the Merger Agreement to elect not to do so), in connection with the Merger, merge with and into such surviving entity (the Holdco Merger). Immediately following the Holdco Merger (or, if TIAA elects not to consummate the Holdco Merger, immediately following the Merger), TIAA-CREF Trust Company, FSB, a federal savings association and wholly owned bank subsidiary of TIAA, will merge with and into EverBank, a federal savings association and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, with EverBank as the surviving bank (the Bank Merger). The Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of each of the Company, TIAA, TCT Holdings and Merger Sub. 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time), (1) holders of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Company Common Stock), will have the right to receive $19.50 in cash without interest for each share of Company Common Stock, and (2) holders of the Company’s Series A 6.75% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Company Preferred Stock), will have the right to receive the liquidation preference of $25,000 plus accrued and unpaid dividends on a share of Company Preferred Stock since the last dividend payment date for the Company Preferred Stock to but excluding the date on which the Effective Time occurs less any dividends declared but unpaid, if any, through the Effective Time, in cash without interest.

Residential Lending and Servicing
We originate prime residential loans nationwide through retail lending offices, direct channels, financial centers and correspondent relationships supported by a centrally controlled underwriting, processing and fulfillment infrastructure. We have expanded our retail and correspondent distribution channels in recent years with an emphasis on prime jumbo residential loans which we either retain on our balance sheet or sell into the secondary market. These channels and products serve the needs of our core clients and are strategic to our balance sheet growth objectives.
We generate mortgage servicing business through the retention of servicing from our origination activities, whole loan acquisitions, and related servicing activities. We service a diverse portfolio of both products and investors including agency and private pools of mortgages secured by properties throughout the United States. During 2014, we realigned the profile of our servicing business through the strategic sale of our default servicing operations and higher delinquency servicing rights to Ditech Financial LLC (Ditech), formerly known as GreenTree Servicing LLC. In 2016 and 2015, we executed sales of $174.0 million and $8.2 billion in unpaid principal balance (UPB), respectively, representing our remaining non-core servicing operations. 
Capital Markets
We opportunistically supplement organic originations by purchasing loans and securities when those investments have more attractive risk-adjusted returns than those we can originate and retain. Our decision to originate, retain, acquire, securitize or sell assets is grounded in our rigorous analytical approach to investing and our disciplined approach to balancing risk against performance. Our flexibility to retain or sell originated assets or acquire assets enables us to achieve attractive risk adjusted returns in a variety of market conditions and enhance stockholder value.
Commercial Banking
Commercial Deposits
We continued to increase our emphasis on commercial deposits in 2016 in order to deepen existing relationships with our large number of small and mid-size business clients and to attract new commercial clients. We distinguish ourselves from competitors based on our attractive product offering, client service and value proposition. Commercial deposit balances represented 23% of our total deposits as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
Commercial & Commercial Real Estate Lending 
We originate commercial real estate loans for the acquisition and refinancing of stabilized commercial real estate for owner users, investors and developers nationwide. Our portfolio is diversified by property type and geographic location and includes owner occupied, single-tenant, multi-tenant commercial and multi-family properties with an average loan size of approximately $3.4 million. We underwrite stabilized properties with experienced borrowers, strong property/tenant cash flow and collateral. We offer our clients competitive fixed and floating interest rates with flexible terms. 
Commercial Finance 
Our commercial finance platform includes vendor equipment finance, lender finance, capital equipment finance and business credit. Our vendor equipment finance division originates equipment leases and loans nationwide through relationships with over 900 equipment manufacturers, distributors and dealers with large groups of high quality clients. Our equipment leases and loans generally finance essential-use health care, office product, technology, industrial and other types of equipment primarily to small and mid-size lessees and borrowers. Our typical equipment financings range from approximately $10,000 to $5.0 million per transaction with typical finance terms ranging from 36 to 84 months.
The lender finance business focuses on providing revolving and term credit facilities secured by equipment and receivables primarily to specialty finance companies on a national basis. We have achieved significant growth in this business since inception, as new client acquisition has driven strong growth in committed facilities as both agent and participant. These credit facilities typically have an initial term of 36 to 84 months and range in size from $15.0 million to more than $50.0 million.
The capital equipment finance business, which commenced in late 2014, is a secured asset finance company providing structured equipment financing loans and leases to middle market companies with transaction sizes of $2.0 million to $30.0 million and terms ranging from 24 to 84 months. This business targets industries like transportation, construction, manufacturing, healthcare and energy with underlying assets that typically have high resale residual value. 
Business credit is our asset-based lending (ABL) operation we purchased in May 2015 with advances and commitments of $94.0 million and $187.0 million, respectively, at acquisition. This ABL portfolio consists of secured revolving and term loans to middle market companies in need of working capital or companies undergoing restructuring. These loans typically range from $5.0 million to more than $40.0 million in commitments, are secured by tightly monitored, liquid inventory and receivables at discounted advance rates which results in reduced losses in the event of default.
Our commercial finance activities provide us with access to approximately 50,000 small business clients nationwide, which creates opportunities to potentially cross-sell other commercial and consumer banking and lending products and services.
Mortgage Warehouse Finance
Our warehouse finance business provides mortgage loan financing to mid-sized, established mortgage banking companies across the country with a proven track record of originating quality mortgages.  A majority of our warehouse financing loans are short-term revolving facilities, which may include sublimits, collateralized by agency and government residential loans originated by our clients.  Our loan commitment sizes generally range from $30 million to $150 million. The majority of the advances made on these facilities are made as short-term repurchase agreements which protects us by providing us ownership of the collateral in the event of default. The advances made on these facilities are discounted based on the relative risk of the underlying collateral with higher advance rates on agency and government deliverable mortgages and smaller advance rates on servicing advances and mortgage servicing assets.

Corporate Services
Our Corporate Services segment provides services to the Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking segments including executive management, technology, legal, human resources, marketing, corporate development, treasury, risk management, accounting, finance and other services and transaction related support. 
Competition 
We face substantial competition in all areas of our operations including internet banks and national, regional and community banks within the markets we serve. We also compete with many other types of financial institutions such as savings and loan institutions, credit unions, mortgage companies, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries. 
Competition for loans is often driven by interest rates, loan origination and related fees and services. Because of our lower all-in cost structure relative to our competition, we are often able to offer borrowers more favorable interest rates than may be available from other lenders. In addition, because we originate assets to hold on our balance sheet as well as sell in the secondary markets, we seek to attract borrowers by offering loan products such as jumbo residential mortgage loans that may not be available from other lenders. We have successfully executed both sales and securitizations of our jumbo preferred fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) products. 
Competition for deposit products is generally based on pricing because of the ease with which clients can transfer deposits from one institution to another. Our multi-channel deposit strategy has lower fixed operating costs than traditional models because we do not incur the expenses associated with primarily operating through a traditional branch network. In order to generate deposits, we pass a portion of these cost savings to our clients through competitive interest rates and fees. Besides price competition, we also seek to increase our deposit market share through product differentiation by offering deposit products that provide investment opportunities such as our WorldCurrency®, MarketSafe® and EverBank Metals Selectsm deposit products. 
We also compete based on the accessibility of our product offerings through our multiple distribution channels. Finally, we seek to distinguish our products and services from other banks through the quality of our online offerings and website and mobile functionality. 
Supervision and Regulation 
Government Regulation 
We and EverBank are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation that affect virtually all aspects of our operations. This supervision and regulation is designed primarily to protect depositors, borrowers, customers and the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), administered by the FDIC, and the banking system as a whole, and generally is not intended for the protection of stockholders. The following summarizes certain of the more important statutory and regulatory provisions applicable to us. 
Certain of the regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Company and EverBank are described below. This description is not intended to be a complete explanation of such requirements and their effects on the Company and EverBank, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations. Any change in laws, regulations, or supervisory actions, whether by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), the FDIC, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the Company and EverBank.

Regulatory Developments 
Mortgage servicing “horizontal review.” A “horizontal review” of the residential mortgage foreclosure operations of fourteen mortgage servicers, including EverBank, by the federal banking agencies resulted in formal enforcement actions against all of the banks subject to the horizontal review. On April 13, 2011, each of the Company and EverBank entered into a consent order with the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) with respect to EverBank's mortgage foreclosure practices and the Company's oversight of those practices. The OCC succeeded the OTS with respect to EverBank's consent order, and the FRB succeeded the OTS with respect to the Company's consent order. The consent orders require, among other things, that the Company establish a new compliance program for mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations and that the Company ensure that it has dedicated resources for communicating with borrowers, policies and procedures for outsourcing foreclosure or related functions and management information systems that ensure timely delivery of complete and accurate information. EverBank was also required to retain an independent firm as part of an “Independent Foreclosure Review” program to conduct a review of residential foreclosure actions that were pending at any time between January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010, as well as residential foreclosure sales that occurred during this time period, in order to determine among other things, whether any borrowers sustained financial injury as a result of any errors, misrepresentations or deficiencies and to provide remediation, as appropriate.
In August 2013, EverBank reached an agreement with the OCC that ended its participation in the Independent Foreclosure Review program mandated by the April 2011 consent order and replaced it with an accelerated remediation process. The agreement included a cash payment of $39.9 million which was made by EverBank to a settlement fund to provide relief to qualified borrowers. In addition, EverBank contributed $6.3 million to organizations certified by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development or other tax-exempt organizations that have as a principal mission providing affordable housing, foreclosure prevention and/or educational assistance to low and moderate income individuals and families. This agreement did not eliminate all of our risks associated with foreclosure-related practices, and it did not protect EverBank from potential individual borrower claims or class action lawsuits, any of which could result in additional expenses. Consistent with the agreement, an amendment to the April 2011 consent order was entered into on October 15, 2013. All terms of the April 2011 consent order that were not explicitly superseded by the amendment remained in effect without modification. As of December 31, 2015, the settlement fund established at the termination of the Independent Foreclosure Review paid $37.5 million in remediation to about 31,000 borrowers, for a 95% cash-rate. The remaining funds were escheated to the applicable state treasurer's office, and no additional payments will be made.
In October 2013, EverBank, along with other mortgage servicers, also received a letter from the OCC requesting, in connection with the April 2011 consent order as amended, that EverBank provide the OCC with an action plan to identify errors and remediate potentially harmed borrowers serviced by EverBank from January 1, 2011 through the date EverBank independently validated that it had corrected all material errors identified during the Independent Foreclosure Review. EverBank submitted its action plan in 2013, which did not require an independent third party review. Pursuant to this plan, EverBank, through an independent paying agent, has paid $1.6 million in remediation to about 35,000 borrowers, for a 77% cash rate as of December 31, 2016.

On June 17, 2015, EverBank, entered into an amended consent order with the OCC that released EverBank from many of the requirements of the 2011 consent order, as amended in 2013, but found that certain aspects remained incomplete and imposed certain additional supervisory conditions related to EverBank’s residential mortgage servicing operations. These conditions included, among other things, limits on the acquisition of new third party residential mortgage loans and servicing rights, restrictions on providing servicing to third parties, restrictions on the outsourcing or sub-servicing of EverBank servicing activities to others, and new appointments of senior officers responsible for residential mortgage servicing or residential mortgage servicing risk management and compliance.
On January 5, 2016, the OCC terminated EverBank’s consent order, as amended in 2013 and 2015, having determined that EverBank had complied the requirements of such order. In conjunction with the termination, EverBank was required by the OCC to pay $1.0 million in civil money penalties pertaining to certain improper fees charged to borrowers between January 2011 and March 2015. The Company’s consent order with the FRB relating to its oversight of mortgage foreclosure practices currently remains in place. At December 31, 2016, EverBank has accrued $0.1 million for potential remediation payments to be made.
Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) has had and will continue to have a broad impact on the financial services industry, imposing significant regulatory and compliance changes, including a fundamental restructuring of the supervisory regime applicable to federal savings associations (also referred to as thrifts) and savings and loan holding companies (also referred to as thrift holding companies), the imposition of increased capital, leverage and liquidity requirements, and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthen safety and soundness within, the financial services sector. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act established a new framework of authority to conduct systemic risk oversight within the financial system distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or Oversight Council, the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC. 
While much of the Dodd-Frank Act has been implemented in the form of final rules from the banking agencies, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on our operations continues to be unclear. In addition, the change in administration in the U.S. has added further uncertainty as to the implementation, scope and timing of additional rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Act, and it is possible that existing rules may be modified or repealed. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse to us and our investors, even if only in the short-term. 
The following items provide a brief description of the relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and their potential impact on our operations and activities, both currently and prospectively. 
Creation of New Governmental Agencies. The Dodd-Frank Act created various new governmental agencies such as the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the CFPB, an independent agency housed within the FRB. The CFPB has a broad mandate to issue regulations, examine compliance and take enforcement action under the federal consumer financial laws, including with respect to EverBank. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB, and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB against certain institutions. 
Limitation on Federal Preemption. The Dodd-Frank Act has reduced the ability of national banks and federal savings associations to rely upon federal preemption of state consumer financial laws. Although the OCC, as the primary regulator of federal savings associations, has the ability to make preemption determinations where certain conditions are met, the new limitations placed on preemption determinations have the potential to create a patchwork of federal and state compliance obligations. This could, in turn, result in significant new regulatory requirements applicable to us, with attendant potentially significant changes in our operations and increases in our compliance costs. It could also result in uncertainty concerning compliance, with attendant regulatory and litigation risks. While some uncertainty remains as to how the OCC will address preemption determinations going forward, on July 20, 2011, the OCC issued a final rule implementing certain Dodd-Frank Act preemption provisions. Among other things, the rule states that federal savings associations, such as EverBank, are subject to the same laws, legal standards and OCC regulations regarding the preemption of state law as national banks. In promulgating the rule, the OCC stated that its prior preemption determinations and regulations remain valid. As a result, we expect EverBank should have the benefit of those determinations and regulations. 
Mortgage Loan Origination and Risk Retention. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes standards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders, including banks and savings associations that, among other things, prohibit us from originating a residential mortgage loan without verifying a borrower's ability to repay, limit the total points and fees that we and/or a broker may charge on conforming and jumbo loans to 3% of the total loan amount and prohibit certain prepayment penalty practices. Also, the Dodd-Frank Act, in conjunction with the FRB's final rule on loan originator compensation prohibits certain compensation payments to loan originators and the steering of consumers to loans not in their interest because the loans will result in greater compensation for a loan originator. These standards have resulted in a myriad of new system, pricing and compensation controls in order to ensure compliance and to decrease repurchase requests and foreclosure defenses. In addition, regulations adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act became effective on December 24, 2015, generally require securitizers to retain an economic interest of 5% in the credit risk relating to residential mortgage loans collateralizing asset-backed securities (ABS) that they sponsor if the loans have not complied with the ability to repay standards. 
Annual Company-Run Stress Tests. We and EverBank are also subject to stress testing requirements that implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring banking organizations with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion but less than $50 billion to conduct annual company-run stress tests, report the results to their primary federal regulator and the FRB, and (following a certain date) to publish a summary of certain aspects of the results. Stress testing requirements include baseline, adverse, and severely adverse economic and financial scenarios to assess potential impacts on our consolidated earnings, losses and capital over a nine quarter planning horizon. According to regulatory standards, a summary of the results of certain aspects of this stress analysis will be released publicly and will contain company specific information and results. It is anticipated that our capital ratios reflected in the 
8

stress test calculation will be an important factor considered by our regulators in evaluating whether proposed payments of dividends, or stock repurchases may be an unsafe or unsound practice and whether our capital levels are adequate to support our operations and growth.
EverBank became subject to stress testing and reporting requirements in 2013.  In each of its submissions, EverBank has met all regulatory thresholds. EverBank Financial Corp will also become subject to these requirements in 2017, and EverBank and EverBank Financial Corp are required to conduct and submit the results of the stress tests to our regulators by July 31, 2017 and publish a summary of those results between October 15, 2017 and October 31, 2017, unless that time period is extended by the regulators. 
Basel III and the Basel III Capital Rules. In July 2013, our primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve, and EverBank’s primary federal regulator, the OCC, published final rules (Basel III Capital Rules) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The Basel III Capital Rules implement the Basel Committee's December 2010 framework known as “Basel III” for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Capital Rules define the components of regulatory capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions' regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Capital Rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions' regulatory capital ratios and replaced the prior risk-weighting approach, with a more risk-sensitive approach. The Basel III Capital Rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies' rules. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for the Company and EverBank on January 1, 2015 (subject to phase-in periods as discussed below). 
The Basel III Capital Rules, among other things, (i) introduced a new capital measure called “Common Equity Tier 1” (CET1), (ii) specified that Tier 1 capital consist of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) defined CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expanded the scope of the deductions/adjustments from capital as compared to existing regulations. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, for most banking organizations, including the Company, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and the most common form of Tier 2 capital is subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan losses, in each case, subject to the Basel III Capital Rules’ specific requirements. 
Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the initial minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015 are as follows:

• | 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets.


• | 6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets.


• | 8.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets.


• | 4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the "leverage ratio").

The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. 
The Basel III Capital Rules also introduced a new “capital conservation buffer”, composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules will require us and EverBank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets (as compared to a previous minimum leverage ratio of 3% for banking organizations that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the appropriate federal regulatory authority's risk-adjusted measure for market risk).
Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items (except gains and losses on cash flow hedges where the hedged item is not recognized on a banking organization’s balance sheet at fair value) are not excluded; however, certain banking organizations, including us and EverBank, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. The Basel III Capital Rules also preclude counting certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, as Tier 1 capital of bank or savings and loan holding companies. However for bank or savings and loan holding companies that had assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009 which includes us, trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 can be treated as Additional Tier 1 capital to the extent that they do not exceed 25% of Tier 1 capital after applying all capital deductions and adjustments.
Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and are being phased-in over a three-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter until fully phased-in at January 1, 2018). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and is phased in over a three-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019).
Management believes, at December 31, 2016, that we and EverBank meet all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently effective. 
Liquidity Requirements. Liquidity risk management and supervision have increasingly become an area of focus since the 
9

financial crisis. During 2014, the U.S. banking agencies adopted final rules to implement the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), one of the two liquidity standards introduced in the Basel III liquidity framework. At present, the LCR does not apply to either the Company or EverBank. The other liquidity standard in the Basel III framework is the net stable funding ratio (NSFR). The NSFR is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of bank over a one-year time horizon. In the second quarter of 2016, the U.S. banking agencies issued a proposed rule that would implement the NSFR for certain U.S. banking organizations. The proposed rule would require certain U.S. banking organizations to ensure they have access to stable funding over a one-year time horizon and has an effective date of January 1, 2018. The proposed rule would not apply to U.S. banking organizations with less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets such as the Company and EverBank.
Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule and the Dodd-Frank Act, which became effective in July 2015, prohibit insured depository institutions (such as EverBank) and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (defined as hedge funds and private equity funds, together "covered funds"). The FRB and the SEC adopted final rules implementing the Volcker Rule in December 2013. The Company does not engage in any significant amount of proprietary trading as defined in the Volcker Rule and has implemented the required procedures for those areas in which trading does occur. The covered funds limits are imposed through a conformance period that is expected to end in July 2017. The Company is required to divest of certain assets that constitute covered funds; however these divestitures are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value and book value of investments that are deemed "covered funds" was $4.1 million and $7.4 million, respectively. For further review of these holdings see the disclosure in the "Asset and Liability Management and Market Risk" section included in Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this Annual Report.
The Company 
We are a unitary savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act (HOLA). As such, we are registered as a savings and loan holding company and are subject to those regulations applicable to a savings and loan holding company. As such, we are subject to FRB examinations, supervision and reporting requirements, and to the FRB’s enforcement authority. Among other things, this authority permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of a subsidiary savings association, such as EverBank. The Company is also subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws.
Currently, without the prior approval of the FRB under the HOLA, HOLA prohibits a savings and loan holding company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from, for example: 

• | acquiring another savings institution or its holding company without prior written approval of the FRB;


• | acquiring or retaining, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a non-subsidiary savings institution, a non-subsidiary holding company, or a non-subsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by HOLA; or


• | acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not insured by the FDIC.

In evaluating an application by a holding company to acquire a savings institution, the FRB must consider, among other factors, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and savings institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the acquiror, the risk to the DIF, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. 
A savings and loan holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary savings associations. This requires the Company to commit to provide necessary capital, liquidity, and other support to EverBank during times of financial distress. 
As a unitary savings and loan holding company, we generally are not restricted under existing laws as to the types of business activities in which we may engage, provided that EverBank continues to satisfy the Qualified Thrift Lender (QTL) test. See “-Regulation of Savings Associations-QTL Test” below for a discussion of the QTL requirements. If we were to acquire a savings institution that will be held as a separate subsidiary, then we may become a multiple savings and loan holding company within the meaning of HOLA and would be subject to limitations on the types of business activities in which we can engage. HOLA limits the activities of a multiple savings institution holding company and its non-insured institution subsidiaries primarily to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHC Act), subject to the prior approval of the FRB, and to other activities authorized by regulation. A multiple savings and loan holding company that meets applicable capital, supervisory and other standards under applicable FRB regulations may elect to be treated as a financial holding company and engage in the broader range of financial activities permissible for a financial holding company under the BHC Act. We do not currently rely on our unitary savings and loan holding company status to engage in business activities that would not be permissible for a multiple savings and loan holding company.
Transactions between EverBank, including any of EverBank’s subsidiaries, and us or any of EverBank’s affiliates, are subject to various conditions and limitations. See “Regulation of Savings Associations-Transactions with Related Parties” below. EverBank must seek approval from the FRB prior to any declaration of the payment of any dividends or other capital distributions to us. See “Regulation of Savings Associations-Limitation on Capital Distributions” below.
EverBank 
EverBank is a federal savings association and, as such, is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC. EverBank also is subject to backup examination and supervision authority by the FDIC, as its deposit insurer. In addition, EverBank is subject to regulation and supervision by the CFPB with regard to federal consumer financial laws. 
EverBank’s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF, which is administered by the FDIC. EverBank must file reports with its federal regulators concerning its activities and financial condition. Additionally, EverBank must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions, and must submit applications or notices prior to forming certain types of subsidiaries or engaging in certain activities through its subsidiaries. The OCC and the FDIC are responsible for conducting periodic examinations to assess EverBank’s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a federal savings association can engage and is 
10

intended primarily for the protection of the DIF and depositors. The OCC and the FDIC have significant discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies. Any change in such applicable activities or policies, whether by the federal banking regulators or U.S. Congress, could have a material adverse impact on us, EverBank and our operations. 
Regulation of Savings Associations 
Business Activities. EverBank derives its lending and investment powers from HOLA and the regulations thereunder, which are enforced by the OCC. Under these laws and regulations, EverBank currently may invest in:

• | mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate;


• | commercial and consumer loans;


• | certain types of debt securities; and


• | certain other assets.

EverBank may also establish service corporations to engage in activities not otherwise permissible for EverBank, including certain real estate equity investments and securities and insurance brokerage. These investment powers are subject to limitations, including, among others, limitations that require debt securities acquired by EverBank to meet certain marketability and credit quality criteria and that limit EverBank’s aggregate investment in various types of loans to certain percentages of capital and/or assets. 
Loans to One Borrower. Under HOLA, federal savings associations are generally subject to the same limits on loans to one borrower as are imposed on national banks. Generally, under these limits, the total amount of loans and extensions of credit made by a federal savings association to one borrower or related group of borrowers (which also includes credit exposure arising from derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, and securities lending and borrowing transactions) outstanding at one time and not fully secured by collateral may not exceed 15% of the savings association’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. In addition to, and separate from, the 15% limitation, the total amount of loans and extensions of credit made by a federal savings association to one borrower or related group of borrowers outstanding at one time and fully secured by readily-marketable collateral may not exceed 10% of the savings association’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Readily-marketable collateral includes certain debt and equity securities and bullion, but generally does not include real estate. At December 31, 2016, EverBank’s limit on loans and extensions of credit to one borrower was approximately $355.5 million and $237.0 million, for the 15% limitation and 10% limitation, respectively. At December 31, 2016, EverBank’s largest aggregate amount of loans and extensions of credit to a single borrower was $200.0 million. This loan relationship was performing in accordance with the terms of its loan agreement as of December 31, 2016.
QTL Test. HOLA requires a federal savings association to meet the QTL test by maintaining at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in certain “qualified thrift investments” on a monthly average basis in at least nine months out of every 12 months. A federal savings association that fails the QTL test must either operate under certain restrictions on its activities or convert to a bank charter. A thrift that fails the QTL test is subject to the general dividend restrictions that would apply to a national bank and is prohibited from paying dividends at all (regardless of its financial condition) unless required to meet the obligations of a company that controls the thrift and specifically approved by the OCC and the FRB. In addition, violations of the QTL test are treated as violations of HOLA subject to remedial enforcement action. At December 31, 2016, EverBank maintained 82.7% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments. EverBank had also satisfied the QTL test in each of the twelve months prior to December 31, 2016 and, therefore, was a QTL. 
Limitation on Capital Distributions. Federal banking regulations currently impose limitations upon certain capital distributions by savings associations, such as certain cash dividends, payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares, payments to stockholders of another institution in a cash-out merger and other distributions charged against capital. 
We are a legal entity separate and distinct from EverBank, and the OCC and FRB regulate all capital distributions by EverBank directly or indirectly to us, including dividend payments. For example, EverBank must obtain the approval of the OCC for a proposed capital distribution if the total amount of all of EverBank’s capital distributions (including any proposed capital distribution) for the applicable calendar year exceeds EverBank’s net income for that year-to-date period plus EverBank’s retained net income for the preceding two years. EverBank also must give prior notice of any dividend to the FRB, with a copy to the OCC, because EverBank is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company. 
EverBank may not pay us dividends if, after paying those dividends, it would fail to meet the required minimum levels under risk-based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage and tangible capital ratio requirements, or in the event the OCC notifies EverBank that it is in need of more than normal supervision. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), an insured depository institution such as EverBank is prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become “undercapitalized.” Payment of dividends by EverBank also may be restricted at any time at the discretion of the appropriate regulator if it deems the payment to constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice. 
Additionally, as noted above, the Dodd-Frank Act imposes additional restrictions on the ability of any thrift that fails to become or remain a qualified thrift lender to pay dividends. 
Liquidity. EverBank is required to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operation, in accordance with federal banking regulations. 
Assessments. The OCC charges assessments to recover the costs of examining savings associations and their affiliates, processing applications and other filings, and covering direct and indirect expenses in regulating savings associations and their affiliates. 
In establishing the amount of an assessment, the OCC may consider the nature and scope of the activities of the entity, the amount and type of assets it holds, the financial and managerial condition of the entity, and any other factor that is appropriate. Under current OCC regulations, the assessments charged to savings associations by the OCC are based on the same assessment schedule as is used for national banks. Assessments are due on March 31 and September 30 of each year. The semiannual assessment is based on an institution’s asset size and is calculated using a table and formula set forth in the OCC’s regulations. The OCC sets the specific rates each year. The OCC applies a condition-based surcharge to the semiannual assessment for institutions with a composite rating of 3, 4 or 5. The condition surcharge is determined by multiplying the general semiannual assessment by 1.5, in the case of any institution that receives a composite rating of 3, and 2.0 
11

in the case of any institution that receives a composite rating of 4 or 5. The condition surcharge is assessed against, and limited to, the first $20 billion of the institution’s book assets. 
Various agencies have the authority to assess additional supervision fees. 
Branching. Subject to certain limitations, HOLA and regulations thereunder permit federally chartered savings associations to establish branches in any state or territory of the United States. 
Transactions with Related Parties. EverBank’s authority to engage in transactions with its “affiliates” is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, (FRA). The applicable regulations for savings associations regarding transactions with affiliates generally conform to the requirements of the FRB's Regulation W. In general, an affiliate of a federal savings association is any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the savings association, other than the savings association’s subsidiaries. For instance, we are deemed an affiliate of EverBank under these regulations. 
Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which a federal savings association may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of the federal savings association’s capital stock and surplus, and contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of the federal savings association’s capital stock and surplus. Covered transactions are defined to include, among other things, a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the FRB) from the affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, derivatives transactions and securities lending transactions where the bank has credit exposure to an affiliate, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate.
Section 23A also establishes specific collateral requirements for loans or extensions of credit to, or guarantees, or acceptances of letters of credit issued on behalf of, an affiliate. Section 23B requires covered transactions and certain other transactions to be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the federal savings association, as those prevailing at the time for transactions with or involving non-affiliates. Additionally, under the applicable regulations, a federal savings association is prohibited from: 

• | making a loan or other extension of credit to an affiliate that is engaged in any non-bank holding company activity; and


• | purchasing, or investing in, securities issued by an affiliate that is not a subsidiary.

 Restrictions also apply to extensions of credit to insiders, and such extensions of credit include, for example, credit exposure arising from derivatives transactions, and to the purchase of assets from insiders. 
Tying Arrangements. EverBank is prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from making loans or offering any other services, or fixing or varying the payment for making loans or providing services, on the condition that a client obtains some additional service from an affiliate or not obtain services from one of our competitors. 
Enforcement. Under the FDIA, the OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings associations and has the authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including any controlling stockholder or any stockholder, attorney, appraiser and accountant who knowingly or recklessly participates in any violation of applicable law or regulation, breach of fiduciary duty, or certain other wrongful actions that have, or are likely to have, a significant adverse effect on an insured depository institution or cause it more than minimal loss. In addition, the FDIC has back-up authority to take enforcement action for unsafe and unsound practices. Formal enforcement action can include the issuance of a capital directive, cease and desist order, civil money penalty, removal of officers and/or directors, institution of proceedings for receivership or conservatorship and termination of deposit insurance. Additionally, the FRB has similar enforcement authority with regard to savings and loan holding companies and their institution-affiliated parties. The bank regulatory agencies are pursuing aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, including criminal prosecutions, as well as law enforcement actions, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures.
Examination. The Company and EverBank are subject to periodic examinations covering many areas by the FRB and the OCC, respectively, and EverBank is subject to periodic examination by the CFPB for purposes of compliance with federal consumer financial laws. A savings institution must demonstrate its ability to manage its compliance responsibilities by establishing an effective and comprehensive oversight and monitoring program. The degree of compliance oversight and monitoring by the institution’s management may be considered in the scope and intensity of examinations of the institution. 
Standards for Safety and Soundness. Pursuant to the requirements of the FDIA, the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness (the "Guidelines"). The Guidelines establish general safety and soundness standards relating to internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the Guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the Guidelines. Currently, if the OCC determines that a federal savings association fails to meet any standard established by the Guidelines, then the OCC may require the federal savings association to submit to the OCC an acceptable plan to achieve compliance. If the federal savings association fails to comply, the OCC may seek an enforcement order in judicial proceedings and impose civil monetary penalties. 
In September 2014, the OCC issued guidelines to establish minimum standards for risk governance that would apply to national banks and federal savings associations with $50 billion or more of average consolidated assets, as well as to smaller institutions that the OCC determines are highly complex or present a heightened risk. While EverBank currently has less than $50 billion in assets, it is not yet known how frequently, or in what instances, the OCC would apply the guidelines to smaller institutions or whether the OCC will develop separate guidelines for smaller institutions in the future. 
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Under the Prompt Corrective Action regulations applicable to federal savings associations, the OCC is required to take certain, and is authorized to take other, supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings associations, such as requiring compliance with a capital restoration plan, restricting dividends, asset growth, acquisitions, branching and new lines of business and, in extreme cases, appointment of a receiver or conservator. The severity of the action required or authorized to be taken increases as a federal savings association’s capital deteriorates. Savings associations are classified into five categories of capitalization as “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” A savings association’s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the savings association’s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. 
12

With respect to EverBank, effective January 1, 2015, the Basel III Capital Rules revise the “prompt corrective action” regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the FDIA, by (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as compared to the current 6%); and (iii) eliminating the current provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized. The total risk-based capital ratio and Tier I leverage ratio requirements remain at 10% and 5%, respectively. Finally, to be considered well capitalized a bank may not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive issued by the OCC, or certain regulations, to meet or maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.    
The OCC categorized EverBank as “well capitalized” following its last examination. At December 31, 2016, EverBank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and was considered to be “well capitalized” with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 13.4%, and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 12.8%. However, there is no assurance that it will continue to be deemed “well capitalized” even if current capital ratios are maintained in the event that asset quality deteriorates. 
Insurance Activities. EverBank is generally permitted to engage in certain insurance activities through its subsidiaries. Federal banking regulations implemented pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLB Act), prohibit, among other things, depository institutions from conditioning the extension of credit to individuals upon either the purchase of an insurance product or annuity or an agreement by the consumer not to purchase an insurance product or annuity from an entity that is not affiliated with the depository institution. The regulations also require prior disclosure of this prohibition to potential insurance product or annuity clients.
Incentive Compensation Arrangements. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint rules or guidelines for financial institutions with more than $1 billion in assets, such as the Company and EverBank, that prohibit incentive compensation arrangements that the agencies determine encourage inappropriate risks by the institution. The banking agencies re-proposed rules in 2016 (initially proposed in 2011) and previously issued guidance on sound incentive compensation policies, but have not yet finalized any rules. We and EverBank have undertaken efforts to ensure that our incentive compensation plans do not encourage inappropriate risks, consistent with three key principles—that incentive compensation arrangements should appropriately balance risk and financial rewards, be compatible with effective controls and risk management, and be supported by strong corporate governance. 
Federal Home Loan Bank System. EverBank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB), which is one of the regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which raises funds in the global financial markets and distributes the proceeds to members and local communities.  Chartered by Congress in 1932 to support mortgage lending, the Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a stable source of funding to its members.  Their products, services and programs help financial institutions manage daily liquidity, fund mortgages originated for sale in the secondary market, fund loans and investments held in portfolio, improve asset/liability management, meet community credit needs, cover temporary deposit outflows, and reduce the funding cost of asset growth.
As a member of the FHLB, EverBank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB. EverBank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in FHLB stock of $249.0 million and $264.8 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. EverBank’s capital stock in FHLB includes $554.0 million purchased during 2016 and $545.7 million purchased during 2015. The FHLB repurchased $569.8 million in 2016 and $476.1 million in 2015. 
For the year ended December 31, 2016, the FHLB paid dividends of $11.9 million on the capital stock held by EverBank. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the FHLB paid dividends of $9.4 million on the capital stock held by EverBank. 
Federal Reserve System. EverBank is subject to provisions of the FRA and the FRB’s regulations pursuant to which depository institutions may be required to maintain reserves against their deposit accounts and certain other liabilities. Currently, savings associations must maintain reserves against transaction accounts (primarily negotiable order of withdrawal and regular interest and noninterest-bearing checking accounts). The FRB regulations establish the specific rates of reserves that must be maintained, which are subject to adjustment by the FRB. EverBank is currently in compliance with those reserve requirements. The required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash, a noninterest-bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank, or a pass-through account as defined by the FRB.
Deposit Insurance 
EverBank is a member of the FDIC, and its deposits are insured through the DIF up to the amount permitted by law. EverBank is thus subject to FDIC deposit insurance premium assessments. The assessment base upon which insurance assessments are based is average consolidated total assets less the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution. Assessment rates for large depository institutions, such as EverBank, are calculated using a “scorecard” that combines the supervisory risk ratings of the institution with certain forward-looking financial measures. The assessment rates are subject to adjustments based upon the insured depository institution’s ratio of: (1) long-term unsecured debt to the assessment base, (2) long-term unsecured debt issued by other insured depository institutions to the assessment base, and (3) brokered deposits to the assessment base. However, the adjustments based on brokered deposits to the assessment base will not apply so long as the institution is well capitalized and has a composite CAMELS rating of 1 or 2. The FDIC may make additional discretionary assessment rate adjustments.
The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits, and eliminated the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. In March 2016, the FDIC finalized rules requiring banks such as EverBank with at least $10 billion in assets would pay a surcharge of 4.5 cents per $100 of their assessment base, after making certain adjustments to enable the reserve ratio to reach 1.35 percent after approximately two years of payments of the proposed surcharges.
The FDIC also collects a deposit-based assessment from insured depository institutions on behalf of The Financing Corporation. The funds from these assessments are used to service debt issued by The Financing Corporation in its capacity as a financial vehicle for the Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation. The Financing Corporation annualized assessment rate is set quarterly and in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $0.0056 per $100 of assessable deposits. These assessments will continue until the debt matures in 2017 through 2019. 
Other Statutes and Regulations 
The Company and EverBank are subject to a myriad of other statutes and regulations affecting their activities. Some of the more important include: 
13

Bank Secrecy Act of 1970-Anti-Money Laundering. Financial institutions must maintain anti-money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures and controls, a designated compliance officer, an ongoing employee training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit function. The Company and EverBank are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and client identification in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign clients. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions, and law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by banks. Anti-money laundering obligations have been substantially strengthened as a result of the USA PATRIOT Act, enacted in 2001 and renewed in 2006. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and they must consider an institution’s compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications. Failure of a financial institution to comply with anti-money laundering obligations could have serious legal, reputational and financial consequences for the institution, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. The regulatory authorities have imposed “cease and desist” orders and civil monetary penalties against institutions found to be violating these obligations. 
Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation. The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others which are administered by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.
Community Reinvestment Act. EverBank is subject to the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (CRA), and related regulations. The CRA states that all banks have a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs for their entire communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA also charges the federal banking regulators, in connection with the examination of the institution or the evaluation of certain regulatory applications filed by the institution, with the responsibility to assess the institution’s record of fulfilling its obligations under the CRA. The federal banking regulators assign an institution a rating of “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve,” or “substantial non-compliance.” The regulatory agency’s assessment of the institution’s record is made available to the public. EverBank received a “satisfactory” rating following its most recent CRA examination. 
Privacy and Data Security. Federal banking laws generally prohibit disclosure of consumer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to consumers annually. Financial institutions, however, will be required to comply with state law if it is more protective of consumer privacy than federal law. Under federal law, federal regulators, including the OCC, must prescribe standards for the security of consumer information. EverBank is subject to such standards, as well as standards for notifying clients in the event of a security breach. Under federal law, EverBank must disclose its privacy policy to consumers, permit clients to opt out of having nonpublic client information disclosed to third parties in certain circumstances, and allow clients to opt out of receiving marketing solicitations based on information about the client received from another subsidiary. States may adopt more extensive privacy protections. EverBank is similarly required to have an information security program to safeguard the confidentiality and security of client information and to ensure proper disposal. Clients must be notified when unauthorized disclosure involves sensitive client information that may be misused. 
Consumer Regulation. Activities of EverBank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. These laws and regulations include, among numerous other things, provisions that: 

• | limit the interest and other charges collected or contracted for by EverBank, including rules respecting the terms of credit cards and of debit card overdrafts;


• | govern EverBank’s disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;


• | require EverBank to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether it is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;


• | prohibit EverBank from discriminating on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors when it makes decisions to extend credit;


• | govern the manner in which EverBank may collect consumer debts; and


• | prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in the provision of consumer financial products and services.

The CFPB's rule that implements the ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “ATR/QM rule”) requires lenders to consider, among other things, income, employment status, assets, payment amounts, and credit history before approving a mortgage, and provides a compliance “safe harbor” for lenders that issue certain “qualified mortgages.” The ATR/QM rule defines a “qualified mortgage” to have certain specified characteristics, and generally prohibit loans with negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years from being qualified mortgages. The rule also establishes general underwriting criteria for qualified mortgages, including that monthly payments be calculated based on the highest payment that will apply in the first five years of the loan and that the borrower have a total debt-to-income ratio that is less than or equal to 43 percent. While “qualified mortgages” will generally be afforded safe harbor status, a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements will attach to “qualified mortgages” that are “higher priced mortgages” (which are generally subprime loans). In addition, the banking regulators have issued final rules that require the securitizer of asset-backed securities to retain not less than 5 percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities, unless subject to an exemption for asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that qualify as “qualified residential mortgages.” These definitions are expected to significantly shape the parameters for the majority of consumer mortgage lending in the U.S. 
Reflecting the CFPB's focus on the residential mortgage lending market, the CFPB has also issued rules to implement requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act pertaining to mortgage loan origination (including with respect to loan originator compensation and loan originator qualifications) and has finalized integrated mortgage disclosure rules that replace and combine certain requirements under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. In addition, the CFPB has issued rules that require servicers to comply with new standards and practices with regard to: error correction; information disclosure; force-placement of insurance; information management policies and procedures; requiring information about mortgage loss mitigation options be provided to delinquent borrowers; providing delinquent borrowers access to servicer personnel with continuity of contact about the borrower’s mortgage loan account; and evaluating borrowers’ applications for available loss mitigation options. These rules also address initial rate adjustment notices for ARMs, periodic statements for residential mortgage 
14

loans, and prompt crediting of mortgage payments and response to requests for payoff amounts. The CFPB has indicated that it expects to issue additional mortgage-related rules in the future.
It is anticipated that the CFPB will engage in numerous other rulemakings in the near term that may impact our business, as the CFPB has indicated that, in addition to specific statutory mandates, it is working on a wide range of initiatives to address issues in markets for consumer financial products and services, such as revisions to privacy notice requirements, new rules for deposit advance products, new rules regarding prepaid cards, new rules regarding debt collection practices, and amendments to the funds availability requirements of Regulation CC. The CFPB has also undertaken an effort to “streamline” consumer regulations and has established a database to collect, track and make public consumer complaints, including complaints against individual financial institutions.
The CFPB also has broad authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices (UDAAP) and to investigate and penalize financial institutions that violate this prohibition. While the statutory language of the Dodd-Frank Act sets forth the standards for acts and practices that violate this prohibition, certain aspects of these standards are untested, which has created some uncertainty regarding how the CFPB will exercise this authority. The CFPB has, however, begun to bring enforcement actions against certain financial institutions for UDAAP violations and issued some guidance on the topic, which provides insight into the agency’s expectations regarding these standards. Among other things, CFPB guidance and its UDAAP-related enforcement actions have emphasized that management of third-party service providers is essential to effective UDAAP compliance and that the CFPB is particularly focused on marketing and sales practices.
We cannot fully predict the effect that any new implementing regulations or revisions to existing regulations that are promulgated by the CFPB will have on our businesses. 
The deposit operations of EverBank are also subject to laws and regulations that: 

• | require EverBank to adequately disclose the interest rates and other terms of consumer deposit accounts;


• | impose a duty on EverBank to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribe procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;


• | require escheatment of unclaimed funds to the appropriate state agencies after the passage of certain statutory time frames; and


• | govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts with EverBank and the rights and liabilities of clients who use ATMs, and other electronic banking services.

EverBank will likely face a significant increase in its consumer compliance regulatory burden as a result of the heightened oversight by the CFPB and the significant rollback of federal preemption of state laws in the area. 
Commercial Real Estate Lending. Lending operations that involve concentrations of commercial real estate loans are subject to enhanced scrutiny by federal banking regulators. Regulators have issued guidance with respect to the risks posed by commercial real estate lending concentrations. Commercial real estate loans generally include land development, construction loans and loans secured by multifamily property and non-farm, non-residential real property where the primary source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property. The guidance prescribes the following guidelines for examiners to help identify institutions that are potentially exposed to concentration risk and may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny:

• | total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of the institution’s total capital; or


• | total commercial real estate loans represent 300% or more of the institution’s total capital, and the outstanding balance of the institution’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36 months.
