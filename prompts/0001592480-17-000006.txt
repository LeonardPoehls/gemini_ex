Item 1. Business
On August 30, 2013, substantially all of the assets and liabilities related to our business were acquired from Lafarge North America Inc., or Lafarge, which we refer to as the Acquisition. Prior to the Acquisition, we operated as the gypsum division of Lafarge. Unless otherwise specified, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “our,” “we,” “us,” the “Company” and “our business” (i) for periods prior to the completion of the Acquisition, refer to the gypsum division of Lafarge, (ii) for periods after completion of the Acquisition but prior to the conversion refer to LSF8 Gypsum Holdings Company, LLC (the entity formed to complete the Acquisition that was converted into Continental Building Products, Inc.) and (iii) for the periods after the conversion, refer to Continental Building Products, Inc., in each case together with its consolidated subsidiaries. We are a holding company and have a relatively short operating history as a stand-alone company.
General
We are a leading, high margin manufacturer of gypsum wallboard and complementary finishing products. Our manufacturing facilities and sales efforts are concentrated in the eastern United States and eastern Canada. Gypsum wallboard is a primary building material used in new residential and commercial construction and repair and remodel ("R&R"). We estimate that in 2016 our market share in the United States east of the Mississippi River, a market which accounted for more than 55% of total U.S. wallboard demand, was approximately 17%, and our share is significantly higher in many of the major metropolitan areas within a shipping radius of 300 miles of our facilities, which include New York, Miami, Tampa, Orlando, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Indianapolis, Nashville, Jacksonville and Hartford.
We sell our products in the new residential, R&R and commercial construction markets. Traditionally, the new residential construction market has been the most significant contributor to wallboard industry demand. It has also been the most volatile. During the most recent economic downturn, new residential construction contracted sharply, but has rebounded in recent years as the economy continues its expansion. R&R activity was also affected by the last recession but has also recovered with the broader economy. We believe that R&R construction will remain an important source of demand as existing U.S. housing stock ages and properties that were foreclosed during the downturn are rehabilitated. The commercial construction market encompasses areas such as office, retail, healthcare, hospitality and government building projects.
The North American gypsum wallboard industry is the largest in the world, with the world’s highest per capita consumption rate. Gypsum wallboard is a low-cost, widely used building product for interior and exterior walls and ceilings in residential and commercial structures. It is highly regarded for its ease and speed of application and its superior performance in providing comfort, fire resistance and thermal and sound insulation. The primary raw material, gypsum, can be either natural or synthetic. Natural gypsum is a mineral mined in select areas throughout North America. Synthetic gypsum is sourced primarily via flue gas desulfurization within coal-fired power plants. According to the Gypsum Association, use of synthetic gypsum has increased from 5% of total wallboard production in 1995 to 45% in 2016. We currently use exclusively synthetic gypsum in our manufacturing process.
New housing starts have been the most significant driver of North American wallboard demand. Starting in 2007, the North American wallboard industry suffered a dramatic decrease in demand, driven primarily by the significant downturn of the North American housing market and the associated credit crisis and global recession. U.S. housing starts fell from a cyclical peak of 2.1 million in 2005 to a 50-year low of 554,000 in 2009. Correspondingly, U.S. wallboard consumption declined by more than 50% from 36.2 billion square feet, or bsf, in 2005 to a low of 17.1 bsf in 2010. Pricing across the industry suffered over this period due to the decline in demand.
Industry-wide wallboard capacity contracted during the housing market downturn from a peak of approximately 40.5 bsf in 2008 to a low of approximately 33.1 bsf in 2012, as producers shuttered older and less efficient facilities or mothballed unneeded production capacity.
The U.S. housing market has continued to grow over the last several years. U.S. housing starts reached 1.00 million in 2014, 1.11 million in 2015 and 1.17 million in 2016, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, driving wallboard consumption to 21.5 bsf 22.1 bsf and 24.7 bsf, respectively.
We believe that there is room for continued improvement in housing starts. Housing starts have averaged 1.44 million over the past 50 years, which is approximately 23% greater than the 2016 starts of 1.17 million. Wallboard consumption has historically correlated closely with increased construction activity, typically trailing housing starts by approximately three to six months. To the extent housing starts continue to increase, we expect a corresponding increase in wallboard demand.

We also expect continued recovery in the R&R market and improvement in the commercial construction market. In the residential segment, the Remodeling Market Index, or RMI, which measures home remodel activity, stood at 54 in the fourth quarter of 2016 according to NAHB Economics Group (an index number of 50 indicates equal numbers of remodelers report activity higher and lower than the previous quarter). Additionally, according to projections from Dodge Data & Analytics, commercial building, measured in dollars spent, is expected to increase by 6% in 2017.
The Acquisition
Lafarge founded its U.S. wallboard business in 1996 when it acquired two manufacturing facilities, including our Buchanan plant, from Georgia-Pacific. During the period from 2000 to 2010, Lafarge expanded its geographic footprint through acquisitions and the greenfield development of our Palatka and Silver Grove plants. During this period, Lafarge pursued a strategy of servicing customers from newer and more efficient plants by shuttering less efficient plants, investing in new facilities and modernizing existing facilities. These efforts culminated with the upgrade of the Buchanan plant in 2006 and the opening of the second production line at the Silver Grove plant in 2007, which we believe made the facility the largest in North America. These investments transformed Lafarge’s gypsum division from a regional player in the northeast to a leading competitor across the eastern United States.
On August 30, 2013, Lone Star Fund VIII (U.S.), L.P., which we refer to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, along with its affiliates and associates (excluding us and companies that it owns as a result of its investment activity), as Lone Star, acquired substantially all of the assets comprising Lafarge’s North American gypsum business for a purchase price of approximately $703 million and the assumption of certain liabilities pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement signed in connection with the Acquisition. On March 18, 2016, Lone Star sold its remaining shares of our common stock and, to our knowledge, no longer holds any ownership interest in the Company. 
Products and Customers
We offer our customers a full range of gypsum wallboard products, including LiftLite ®, our lightweight product designed to be easier to lift and install, our Mold Defense ® line of products designed for enhanced protection against mold and mildew, and our Weather Defense ® line of moisture and mold-resistant exterior sheathing. To complement our wallboard business and to better serve our customers, we also operate a finishing products business that manufactures a comprehensive line of joint compounds at our plant in Silver Grove (Kentucky) and our joint compound plant in Chambly (Quebec). We provide superior customer service based on customer needs, consistently delivering high quality finished product and providing orders accurately with fast delivery times. Certain customers and markets have also favored the use of synthetic gypsum products, which we manufacture, versus natural gypsum products for the additional benefit of receiving Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED, ratings to support environmentally responsible initiatives.
Our marketing and sales strategy consists of targeted direct sales efforts to existing and potential customers using an experienced sales force. We operate a single centralized customer-service call center. We also have a centralized logistics team for all of our operations that manages freight, storage and other distribution-related tasks. As is customary in the industry, we do not enter into long-term agreements with our customers. To encourage our customers to order our products and to increase their loyalty, we offer incentive programs, which provide for customer rebates that are triggered when specified sales volumes or net sales are reached. We generally bear the cost of delivering our finished products to our customers. We deliver by truck and, in the case of our Silver Grove and Palatka plants, by truck and rail. At each of our facilities, we have one or two carriers under contract that provide the majority of our shipping services.
We regularly achieve high rankings in customer service surveys and have received numerous “supplier of the year” awards from major customers. We consistently provide a high level of service to our customers through a combination of product availability and quality, on-time delivery, and timely and accurate invoicing. We sell our products through several different channels and to a broad group of customers, including gypsum wallboard distributors, buying groups, wholesalers and mass merchants. Lowes, our largest customer, represented 15%, 16% and 15% of our net sales in years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and no other customer represented more than 10% of sales.
Manufacturing and Distribution
We operate highly efficient and automated manufacturing facilities in Silver Grove (Kentucky), Palatka (Florida) and Buchanan (New York) that produce a full range of gypsum wallboard products for our diversified customer base. We are committed to operational excellence and have invested heavily in our facilities, which we believe are among the newest, largest and most efficient wallboard plants in North America.

Gypsum wallboard is manufactured by mixing finely ground, partially dehydrated, or calcined, gypsum with water and forming the resulting slurry between two layers of continuous paperboard liner. It is allowed to harden briefly before being dried and cut to specification.
The manufacturing process is tightly controlled to achieve uniformity and desired board characteristics. Additives can be introduced to the slurry at the beginning of the process to give the resulting board enhanced properties. For instance, fiberglass can be added to enhance fire resistance or fungicides added to defend against mold. Additives are also used to control the manufacturing process and to counteract impurities occurring in the gypsum.
We use only synthetic gypsum in our wallboard products, which we believe enhances our manufacturing quality and consistency, reduces production costs and provides important environmental benefits relative to natural gypsum. We are the only producer of gypsum wallboard in the United States to use 100% synthetic gypsum. Synthetic gypsum is principally produced through a process known as flue gas desulfurization, or FGD. The FGD process typically takes place in scrubbing towers in coal-fired power plants. Our strategically positioned plants provide us with two key benefits: cost-effective access to our supplies of synthetic gypsum, which reduces our inbound transportation costs, and close proximity to many major metropolitan areas, which decreases our product delivery costs.
We purchase all of our synthetic gypsum supplies from coal-fired power plants with operations near, or easily accessible to, our wallboard facilities. To secure our supplies, we have entered into long-term agreements with major suppliers with remaining terms (with extensions) ranging from approximately 10 years to 33 years. Our supply contracts provide for a base price with escalation provisions. These contracts are structured as “take-or-pay” arrangements, where the sellers are required to supply a specified annual amount of gypsum and we are required to buy a specified annual amount, or else, in either case, pay penalties under the contracts. Two of our plants have sufficient supply under contract to operate at our full design capacity, while one of our plants requires a small amount of additional supply at full capacity. We believe that we would be able to purchase additional synthetic gypsum on the open market to the extent any production increases require it, or if market conditions are favorable.
Our Seven Hills joint venture with WestRock Company, or WestRock, provides us with a reliable source of high-quality paperboard liner required for consistent wallboard production. We therefore have a long-term supply agreement that fulfills most of our current paper requirements. The Seven Hills joint venture has the capacity to supply us with approximately 75% of our paper needs at our full capacity, and some additional capacity can be added with a modest additional investment.
Our manufacturing processes utilize significant amounts of natural gas and electricity. We purchase both natural gas and electricity on the open market. We use derivative instruments to manage certain commodity price and interest rate exposures. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes, and we typically do not hedge beyond one year. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, for additional information regarding our financial exposures.
Our wallboard facilities are located in close proximity to major metropolitan areas in the eastern United States and eastern Canada, lowering both our inbound and outbound transportation costs and facilitating timely delivery to our customers. Each of our facilities allows us to offer same-day delivery service to many of our key metropolitan markets, including our Buchanan plant, which provides same-day delivery service to customers in the New York City tri-state area, which management believes provides us with a competitive advantage.

Competition
The market for our wallboard and finishing products is highly competitive. We believe the key competitive factors in the market include:

• | price;


• | service;


• | product quality; and


• | product range.

There are currently seven gypsum wallboard manufacturers in the United States: USG, National Gypsum, Georgia-Pacific, CertainTeed, Eagle Materials, Pabco Gypsum, and us. Of these, we believe only six compete in the eastern United States. Gypsum wallboard has a high weight-to-value ratio, so it is advantageous to both source raw materials and produce gypsum wallboard in close proximity to where it is used. If manufacturing facilities are not located in close proximity to end markets, transportation costs can render the cost of finished goods uncompetitive compared to locally manufactured wallboard. Accordingly, competition in the industry occurs principally on a regional basis. Each competitive geographic region has a different group of manufacturers and customers and, as a result, a different competitive landscape. A number of our competitors are larger than us and may have greater resources or lower costs of capital than we do.
Although gypsum wallboard remains a regional industry, consolidation in the industry has resulted in increased market share for certain industry participants, including us. In 1997 there were thirteen gypsum wallboard producers, compared to seven in 2016. This consolidation has occurred almost entirely amongst the smaller producers. Since 1997, our national market share has grown from 3% to 10%.
Other Information
Because we fill orders upon receipt, we do not have any significant order backlog.
Our business does not have any special working capital requirements.
Spending on research and development was de minimis over the past three years.
No material part of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontractors at the election of any government.
Sales of our wallboard products are, similar to many building products, seasonal in that sales are generally slightly higher from spring through autumn when construction activity is greatest in our markets. As a result, our quarterly results have varied in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter in the future.
Employees
We had 617 employees as of December 31, 2016. Some of our employees at our Buchanan wallboard plant, representing approximately 13% of our workforce, are represented by two unions. The collective bargaining agreements with these two unions will expire on November 30, 2017. Our remaining employees are non-union. We believe our relationships with both our union and non-union employees are good.
Intellectual Property
We maintain many trademarks for our wallboard and finishing products, including, among others, LiftLite ®, Firecheck ®, Mold Defense ® and Rapid Coat ®. We also rely on patents and trade secret law to protect some of our manufacturing processes. Loss of one or more of our patents, trademarks or licenses would not have a material impact on our business or our ability to continue our operations in the foreseeable future.
Environmental Matters
Our wallboard and finishing products businesses are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to health, safety and the environment. Some of these laws, such as the federal Clean Air Act and the federal Clean Water Act (and analogous state laws), impose environmental permitting obligations and govern the nature and amount of emissions that may be generated. Some laws, such as the Federal Superfund law (and analogous state laws), impose obligations to clean up or remediate spills of hazardous materials into the environment. Some laws, such as the federal 
7

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, (and analogous state laws), impose obligations on us with respect to the management of waste products. None of our operations is the subject of any material local, state or federal environmental proceedings or inquiries. We do not, and have not, used asbestos in any of our products.
Our manufacturing processes for wallboard use a significant amount of energy, especially natural gas. Increased regulation of energy use to address the possible emission of greenhouse gases and climate change could materially increase our manufacturing costs. The U.S. Congress and several states are considering or have adopted legislation to reduce emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. In October 2016, following litigation regarding rules proposed by the EPA in 2010 and the regulation of greenhouse gases, the EPA proposed new rules requiring that new or modified “stationary sources” that are already subject to "Prevention of Significant Deterioration" permitting, and that increase greenhouse gas emissions by 75,000 tons per year, demonstrate that they are incorporating the “best available control technology” to minimize those emissions. If these rules are finalized, to the extent we decide to make major modifications to our plants, these rules could require that we incur significant costs to satisfy permitting requirements. In addition, the EPA has adopted regulations (the validity of which are currently the subject of litigation) known as the Clean Power Plan designed to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants. Enactment of new climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the U.S. Congress or various states, or the adoption of additional regulations by the EPA and analogous state or Canadian governmental agencies that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and demand for our services or products. From time to time, legislation has been introduced proposing a “carbon tax” on energy use or establishing a so-called “cap and trade” system. Such legislation would likely increase the cost of energy and, therefore, could materially increase our manufacturing costs. See “Risk Factors".
