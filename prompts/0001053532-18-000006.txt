Item 1. | Business

The “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” means LaSalle Hotel Properties and one or more of its subsidiaries (including LaSalle Hotel Operating Partnership, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”) and LaSalle Hotel Lessee, Inc. (together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, “LHL”)), or, as the context may require, LaSalle Hotel Properties only, the Operating Partnership only or LHL only.
General
The Company, a Maryland real estate investment trust organized on January 15, 1998, primarily buys, owns, redevelops and leases upscale and luxury full-service hotels located in convention, resort and major urban business markets. The Company is a self-administered and self-managed REIT as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). As a REIT, the Company is generally not subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of its net income that is currently distributed to its shareholders. The income of LHL, the Company’s wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”), is subject to taxation at normal corporate rates.
As of December 31, 2017, the Company owned interests in 41 hotels with approximately 10,450 guest rooms located in seven states and the District of Columbia. Each hotel is leased to LHL under a participating lease that provides for rental payments equal to the greater of (i) a base rent or (ii) a participating rent based on hotel revenues. The LHL leases expire between December 2018 and December 2020. Lease revenue from LHL is eliminated in consolidation. A third-party non-affiliated hotel operator manages each hotel pursuant to a hotel management agreement, the terms of which are discussed in more detail under “—Hotel Managers and Hotel Management Agreements.”
Substantially all of the Company’s assets are held directly or indirectly by, and all of its operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership. The Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. The Company owned, through a combination of direct and indirect interests, 99.9% of the common units of the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2017. The remaining 0.1% is held by limited partners who owned 145,223 common units of the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2017. Subject to certain limitations, common units in the Operating Partnership are redeemable for cash, or at the Company’s option, for a like number of the Company’s common shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value per share.
The Company’s principal offices are located at 7550 Wisconsin Avenue, 10th Floor, Bethesda, Maryland 20814. The Company’s website is www.lasallehotels.com. The Company makes available on its website free of charge its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports. Also posted on the Company’s website, and available in print upon request, are charters of each committee of the Board of Trustees, the Company’s code of business conduct and ethics, the Company’s corporate governance guidelines and the Company’s trustee independence standards. Within the time period required by the SEC, the Company will disclose on its website any amendment to the code of business conduct or ethics or any waiver applicable to any executive officer, trustee or senior financial officer of any provision of the code of business conduct and ethics that would otherwise be required to be disclosed under the rules of the SEC or New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). The information contained on, or otherwise accessible through, the Company’s website is not incorporated into, and does not form a part of, this report or any other report or document we file with or furnish to the SEC.
Strategies and Objectives
The Company’s primary objectives are to provide income to its shareholders through increases in distributable cash flow and to increase long-term total returns to shareholders through appreciation in the value of its common shares. To achieve these objectives, the Company seeks to:

• | enhance the return from, and the value of, the hotels in which it owns interests and any additional hotels the Company may acquire or develop; and


• | invest in or acquire additional hotel properties on favorable terms.

The Company seeks to achieve revenue growth principally through:

• | renovations, repositionings and/or expansions at selected hotels;


• | acquisitions of full-service hotels located in convention, resort and major urban markets in the United States, especially upscale and luxury full-service hotels in such markets where the Company perceives strong demand growth or significant barriers to entry;

2


• | selective development of hotel properties, particularly upscale and luxury full-service hotels in high barrier-to-entry and high demand markets where development economics are favorable; and


• | revenue enhancing programs at the hotels.

The Company intends to acquire additional hotels in urban, convention and resort markets, consistent with the growth strategies outlined above and which may:

• | possess unique competitive advantages in the form of location, physical facilities or other attributes;


• | be available at significant discounts to replacement cost, including when such discounts result from reduced competition for hotels with long-term management and/or franchise agreements;


• | benefit from brand or franchise conversion or removal, new management, renovations or redevelopment or other active and aggressive asset management strategies; or


• | have expansion opportunities.

The Company continues to focus on eight primary urban markets; however, it will acquire assets in other markets if the investment is consistent with the Company’s strategies and return criteria. The primary urban markets are:

• Boston | • San Diego 
• Chicago | • San Francisco 
• Los Angeles | • Seattle 
• New York | • Washington, DC 

Hotel Managers and Hotel Management Agreements
The Company seeks to grow through strategic relationships with premier, internationally recognized hotel operating companies, including Hilton Hotels Corporation, Marriott International, Outrigger Lodging Services, Noble House Hotels & Resorts, Hyatt Hotels Corporation, Benchmark Hospitality, Two Roads Hospitality, Davidson Hotel Company, Kimpton Hotel & Restaurant Group, LLC, Accor, HEI Hotels & Resorts, JRK Hotel Group, Inc., Viceroy Hotel Group, Highgate Hotels, Access Hotels & Resorts, Provenance Hotels and Evolution Hospitality. The Company believes that having multiple operators creates a network that will generate acquisition opportunities. In addition, the Company believes its acquisition capabilities are enhanced by its considerable experience, resources and relationships in the hotel industry specifically and the real estate industry generally.
As of December 31, 2017, all of our 41 hotels are leased by LHL, and are managed and operated by third parties pursuant to management agreements entered into between LHL and the respective hotel management companies.
Our management agreements for the 41 hotels leased to LHL have the terms described below.

• | Base Management Fees. Our management agreements generally provide for the payment of base management fees between 1.0% and 4.0% of the applicable hotel’s revenues or a fixed amount, as determined in the agreements. 


• | Incentive Management and Other Fees. Some of our management agreements provide for the payment of incentive management fees between 10.0% and 20.0% of gross operating profit or as a percentage of, or in excess of, certain thresholds of net operating income or cash flow of the applicable hotel, if certain criteria are met. Certain of the management agreements also provide for the payment by us of sales and marketing, accounting and other fees. 


• | Terms. The remaining terms of our management agreements range from less than one year to 14 years not including renewals, and less than one year to 44 years including renewals. Only one management agreement has a remaining non-cancelable term of 14 years, with the next longest non-cancelable term of 11 years. 


• | Ability to Terminate. We have 40 management agreements (Park Central Hotel New York and WestHouse Hotel New York operate under one agreement) of which 37 are terminable at will. The remaining three management agreements are terminable only with cause. Termination fees range from zero to up to eight times annual base management and incentive management fees, due upon early termination. One management agreement has termination fees at eight times, one at seven times, one at six times, one at five times and one at four times.

• | Operational Services. Each manager has exclusive authority to supervise, direct and control the day-to-day operation and management of the respective hotel including establishing all room rates, processing reservations, procuring inventories, supplies and services, and preparing public relations, publicity and marketing plans for the hotel. 


• | Executive Supervision and Management Services. Each manager supervises all managerial and other employees, reviews the operation and maintenance, prepares reports, budgets and projections, and provides other administrative and accounting support services to the respective hotel. 


• | Chain Services. Our management agreements with major brands require the managers to furnish chain services that are generally made available to other hotels managed by such managers. Such services may, for example, include: (1) the development and operation of computer systems and reservation services; (2) management and administrative services; (3) marketing and sales services; (4) human resources training services and (5) such additional services as may from time to time be more efficiently performed on a national, regional or group level. 


• | Working Capital. Our management agreements typically require us to maintain working capital for a hotel and to fund the cost of supplies such as linen and other similar items. We are also responsible for providing funds to meet the cash needs for the hotel operations if at any time the funds available from the hotel operations are insufficient to meet the financial requirements of the hotel. 


• | Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment Replacements. We are required to provide to the managers all the necessary furniture, fixtures and equipment for the operation of the hotels (including funding any required furniture, fixtures and equipment replacements). Our management agreements generally provide that once each year the managers will prepare a list of furniture, fixtures and equipment to be acquired and certain routine repairs to be performed in the next year and an estimate of funds that are necessary therefore, subject to our review and approval. For purposes of funding the furniture, fixtures and equipment replacements, a specified percentage of the gross revenues of each hotel (typically 4.0%) is either deposited by the manager in an escrow account or held by the owner. 


• | Building Alterations, Improvements and Renewals. Our management agreements generally require the managers to prepare an annual estimate of the expenditures necessary for major repairs, alterations, improvements, renewals and replacements to the structural, mechanical, electrical, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, plumbing and vertical transportation elements of the hotels. In addition to the foregoing, the management agreements generally provide that the managers may propose such changes, alterations and improvements to the hotels as required by reason of laws or regulations or, in each manager’s reasonable judgment, to keep each respective hotel in a safe, competitive and efficient operating condition. 


• | Sale of a Hotel. Three of our management agreements limit our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer a hotel, unless the transferee assumes the related management agreement and meets specified other conditions and/or unless the transferee is not a competitor of the manager. 


• | Service Marks. During the term of our management agreements, the service mark, symbols and logos currently used by the managers may be used in the operation of the hotels. Any right to use the service marks, logo and symbols and related trademarks at a hotel will terminate with respect to that hotel upon termination of the management agreement with respect to such hotel. 

Recent Developments
In September 2017, the Southernmost Beach Resort Key West and The Marker Waterfront Resort temporarily closed due to the effects of Hurricane Irma. Both hotels were fully open as of the end of December 2017. The Company maintains property, flood, fire and business interruption insurance at both Key West resorts. For the combined properties, insurance is subject to deductibles of approximately $5.0 million in total which encompasses both property and business interruption coverage. The Company is currently in the process of filing insurance claims for business interruption experienced at both resorts and non-structural property damage and cleanup costs sustained at Southernmost Beach Resort Key West.
The Massport Bonds (as defined below) mature on March 1, 2018. The Company intends to repay the Massport Bonds upon maturity with available cash. 
Hotel Renovations
The Company believes that its regular program of capital improvements at the hotels, including replacement and refurbishment of furniture, fixtures and equipment, helps maintain and enhance its competitiveness and maximize revenue growth.

Joint Venture
The Company holds a 99.99% controlling interest in The Liberty Hotel. Since the Company holds a controlling interest, the accounts of the joint venture have been included in the consolidated financial statements. The 0.01% interest of the outside partner is included in noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities in the consolidated balance sheets. 
Tax Status
The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. As a result, the Company generally is not subject to corporate income tax on that portion of its net income that is currently distributed to shareholders. A REIT is subject to a number of highly technical and complex organizational and operational requirements, including requirements with respect to the nature of its gross income and assets and a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its taxable income. The Company may, however, be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property.
Effective January 1, 2001, the Company elected to operate its wholly owned subsidiary, LHL, as a TRS. Accordingly, LHL is required to pay corporate income taxes at the applicable rates.
Seasonality
The Company’s hotel operations historically have been seasonal. Taken together, the hotels maintain higher occupancy rates during the second and third quarters of each year. These seasonality patterns can be expected to cause fluctuations in the quarterly hotel operations.
Competition
The hotel industry is highly competitive. Each of the hotels is located in a developed area that includes other hotel properties as well as alternative lodging companies. The number of competitive hotel properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on occupancy, average daily rate (“ADR”) and room revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) at the Company’s current hotels or at hotels acquired in the future. In addition, the Company may be competing for investment opportunities with entities that have substantially greater financial resources than the Company. These entities may generally be able to accept more risk than the Company can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the amount of leverage utilized, creditworthiness of a hotel operator or the geographic proximity of its investments. Competition may generally reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to the Company and increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell.
Environmental Matters
In connection with the ownership of hotels, the Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under these laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, the presence of contamination from hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remediate such contaminated property properly, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to borrow using such property as collateral. Furthermore, a person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of a hazardous or toxic substance at a property owned by another, or who transports such substance to or from such property, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substance released into the environment at the disposal or treatment facility. The costs of remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral. In connection with the ownership of hotels, the Company may be potentially liable for such costs.
The Company believes that its hotels are in compliance, in all material respects, with all federal, state and local environmental ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters, the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company has not received verbal or written notice from any governmental authority of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of the properties currently under its ownership.
Employees
The Company had 36 employees as of December 31, 2017. All persons employed in the day-to-day operations of the hotels are employees of the management companies engaged by the lessees to operate such hotels. None of the Company’s employees is a member of any union; however, some employees of the hotel managers at several of the Company’s hotels are currently represented by labor unions and are subject to collective bargaining agreements.
