ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
 
LifeLogger Technologies Corp. (“we,” “us,” the “Company” or “LifeLogger”) was incorporated in Nevada on June 4, 2012 under the name Snap Online Marketing Inc. We changed our name effective January 31, 2014.


The Company and its business
 
We are a lifelogging software company that developed and host a proprietary cloud-based software solution accessible on iOS and Android devices that offers an enhanced media experience for consumers by augmenting videos, livestreams and photos with additional context information and providing a platform that makes it easy to find and use that data when viewing or sharing media. Lifelogging is a way of journaling one’s life using media, often through the use of wearable electronic devices. We want to make lifelogging accessible to the mass market by taking videos and images right from users’ smart phones, wearable camera and/or sensor solutions, and adding geographic, visual and test data designed to enhance the relevance and context of the information collected.
 
Following the launch of our private beta version of the LifeLogger platform in August 2015 to users who expressed interest for exclusive testing with their iOS and Android devices, we launched an open public version during the first quarter of 2016. This release has the primary value proposition built in with geo-coordinates, face detection, playback with interactive map, social engagement features that enable easy sharing and ability to “like” other postings. Among the potential uses of our platform are the ability to share a video of a customer’s vacation in Europe with others that is integrated with an interactive map showing the viewer where the video is taking place, allowing the viewer to switch to the map view and even show additional views of those locations and other media taken by other people nearby. The end result is designed to provide an enhanced media experience much richer than just sharing the video alone.
 
We maintain the operation of this platform and are seeking potential distributors, joint venture and strategic alliance partners and additional sources of financing to enable us to pursue marketing and future development and commercialization activities to increase engagement and make improvements to the user interface and experience.
 
We completed a prototype of our integrated LifeLogger wearable video camera for testing in 2014 and seek potential distributors and joint venture and strategic alliance partners for this product. We will evaluate opportunities from these efforts to determine the extent of our future development and marketing of this device.


Operational Resources
 
We will rely on third party product development and software engineering and consulting providers for the development and support of our LifeLogger Platform on an as-needed basis.
Principal Suppliers
 
We believe we will have adequate access to a qualified development team for the LifeLogger Platform.
 
Competition
 
We will initially license our platform exclusively via the Internet. Our competition includes other Internet based sellers of LifeLogger services. Some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Our competitors may undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns, including print and television advertisements, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies that may allow them to build larger customer and distribution bases than ours. Our competitor’s services may be equal or superior to our proposed platform or that achieve greater market acceptance than ours.
Government Regulation
 
Our LifeLogger Platform business operates in a regulated environment under various federal and state consumer protection and other laws, rules and regulations, including the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the federal Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act. Some of the more significant regulations that we will become subject are described below.

Our LifeLogger Platform is subject to a number of U.S. federal and state, and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These may involve user privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation and online payment services. In particular, we will become subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of user data. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States. U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly-evolving industry in which we intend to operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies, and foreign governments concerning data protection which could affect us. For example, the European Commission is currently considering a data protection regulation that may include operational requirements for companies that receive personal data that are different than those currently in place in the European Union, and that may also include significant penalties for non-compliance.
 
We believe we are in substantial compliance with all governmental regulations applicable to our business. As we expand our operations, we will employ a number of external resources to assist us in complying with our regulatory obligations. These external resources may include outside technology providers and consultants. As we expand our business, we will be required to raise additional capital to cover the expected increase in costs to hire and train additional internal and external resources to ensure we remain in substantial compliance with our governmental obligations.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
We own the trademark for “LL Life Logger,” “LifeLogger,” and “What’s Your Story”. These trademarks are registered in the United States and a trademark for “Life Logger” has been registered in the European Union.
Employees
 
As of December 17, 2018, we have no full-time employees. However, we have a consulting contract with our Chief Executive Officer to provide services to us on a part-time basis.
Our Corporate History and Recent Developments
 
We were incorporated in Nevada on June 4, 2012 under the name Snap Online Marketing Inc. We changed our name effective January 31, 2014 when we embarked on the development and commercialization of innovative lifelogging solutions enabling the recording, secure online storage, organizing, retrieving, appreciation and selective sharing of personal information, data, photos, videos and other activities with friends and the public at large. Prior to January 31, 2014, we were engaged in providing web based marketing services.
 
On June 30, 2016, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Pixorial, Inc. (“Pixorial”) pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement entered into among us, Pixorial and Andres Espiniera dated June 20, 2016 (the “Amended Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Agreement, we acquired the trademark “What’s Your Story” and Pixorial’s customer list (the “Pixorial Asset Acquisition”). Under the terms of the Amended Agreement, we agreed to issue 86,673 shares of our unregistered common stock to the existing shareholders and certain creditors of Pixorial. In addition, we amended the exercise price of Mr. Espineira’s November 10, 2015 stock option award to acquire 200,000 shares of our common stock to $3.00 per share. The shares of our common stock to be issued to Pixorial’s shareholders and creditors are subject to a lock-up agreement whereby one-third the number received by each may be sold beginning as of each of the first three anniversaries of the closing of the Pixorial Asset Acquisition.
 
We amended our amended and restated articles of incorporation to increase our authorized capital stock from 125,000,000 shares to 500,000,000 shares, of which 495,000,000 shares will be common stock and 5,000,000 will be preferred stock and also effected a 1 for 30 reverse split of our common stock outstanding. This corporate action was approved by FINRA on March 24, 2017 and became effective as of March 27, 2017.
