Item 1. Business
General
Forest City Realty Trust, Inc. (with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) principally engages in the operation, development, management and acquisition of office, retail and apartment real estate and land throughout the United States. The Company had approximately $8.2 billion of consolidated assets in 20 states and the District of Columbia at December 31, 2016. The Company’s core markets include Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and the greater metropolitan areas of New York City, San Francisco and Washington D.C. The Company has regional offices in Boston, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and the Company’s corporate headquarters in Cleveland, Ohio.
The Company recently completed an internal reorganization and began presenting reportable segments based on this new structure for the reporting period ended September 30, 2016. The new structure is organized around the Company’s real estate operations, real estate development and corporate support service functions. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current period’s reportable segment presentation.
Real Estate Operations represents the performance of the Company’s core rental real estate portfolio and is comprised of the following reportable operating segments:

• | Office - owns, acquires and operates office and life science buildings.


• | Retail - owns, acquires and operates regional malls, specialty/urban retail centers and amenity retail within our mixed-use projects.


• | Apartments - owns, acquires and operates rental properties, including upscale and middle-market apartments, adaptive re-use developments and subsidized senior housing.

The remaining reportable operating segments consist of the following:

• | Development represents the development and construction of office and life science buildings, regional malls, specialty/urban retail centers, amenity retail, apartments, condominiums and mixed-use projects. Included in the Development segment are recently opened operating properties prior to stabilization. Development also includes the horizontal development and sale of land to residential, commercial and industrial customers primarily at its Stapleton project in Denver, Colorado.


• | Corporate is comprised of departments providing executive oversight to the entire company and various support services for Operations, Development and Corporate employees.


• | Other represents the operations of several non-core investments, including the Barclays Center, a sports and entertainment arena located in Brooklyn, New York (“Arena”) (sold in January 2016), the Company’s equity method investment in the Brooklyn Nets (the “Nets”) (sold in January 2016), and military housing operations (sold in February 2016).

Financial information about reportable operating segments required by this item is included in Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and Note AA – Segment Information.
Segment Transfers
The Development segment includes projects in development, projects under construction along with recently opened operating properties prior to stabilization. Projects will be reported in their applicable operating segment (Office, Retail or Apartments) beginning on January 1 of the year following stabilization. Therefore, the Development segment will continue to report results from recently opened properties until the year-end following initial stabilization. The Company generally defines stabilized properties as achieving 92% or greater occupancy or having been open and operating for one or two years, depending on the size of the project. Once a stabilized property is transferred to the applicable Operations segment on January 1, it will be considered “comparable” beginning with the next January 1, as that will be the first time the property is stabilized in both periods presented.
REIT Conversion
On January 13, 2015, the board of directors of Forest City Enterprises, Inc., the Company’s predecessor, approved a plan to pursue conversion to real estate investment trust (“REIT”) status. On May 29, 2015, Forest City Enterprises, Inc. formed the Company as a Maryland corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Forest City Enterprises, Inc. On October 20, 2015, the shareholders of Forest City Enterprises, Inc. approved and adopted the merger agreement that implemented the restructuring of Forest City Enterprises, Inc. into a holding company so as to facilitate its conversion to a REIT.
2

Pursuant to the merger agreement, effective as of 11:59 pm, Eastern Time, on December 31, 2015 (the “Effective Time”), (i) a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company merged with and into Forest City Enterprises, Inc., with Forest City Enterprises, Inc. as the surviving corporation, (ii) each outstanding share of Forest City Enterprises, Inc. Class A common stock, par value $.33 1/3 per share, and Class B common stock, par value $.33 1/3 per share, automatically converted into one share of Forest City Realty Trust, Inc. Class A common stock, $.01 par value per share, and Class B common stock, $.01 par value per share, respectively, (iii) Forest City Enterprises, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and (iv) the Company became the publicly-traded New York Stock Exchange-listed parent company that succeeded to and continued to operate substantially all of the existing businesses of Forest City Enterprises, Inc. and its subsidiaries. In addition, each share of Class A common stock of Forest City Enterprises, Inc. held in treasury at December 31, 2015 ceased to be outstanding at the Effective Time of the Merger, and a corresponding adjustment was recorded to Class A common stock and additional paid-in capital. Immediately following the merger, Forest City Enterprises, Inc. converted into a Delaware limited partnership named “Forest City Enterprises, L.P.” (the “Operating Partnership”).
In this annual report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise specifically stated or the context otherwise requires, all references to “the Company,” “Forest City,” “we,” “our,” “us” and similar terms refer to Forest City Enterprises, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and Forest City Realty Trust, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership, as of the Effective Time and thereafter.
Company Operations
The Company believes it is organized in a manner enabling it to qualify, and intends to operate in a manner allowing it to continue to qualify, as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As such, the Company intends to elect REIT status for its taxable year ended December 31, 2016, upon filing the 2016 Form 1120-REIT with the Internal Revenue Service on or before October 15, 2017.
The Company holds substantially all of its assets, and conducts substantially all of its business, through the Operating Partnership. The Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and, as of December 31, 2016, the Company directly or indirectly owns all of the limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership.
The Company holds and operates certain of its assets through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). A TRS is a subsidiary of a REIT subject to applicable corporate income tax. The Company’s use of TRSs enables it to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with REIT qualification requirements and allows the Company to retain income generated by these businesses for reinvestment without the requirement of distributing those earnings. The primary non-REIT qualified businesses held in TRSs include 461 Dean Street, an apartment building in Brooklyn, New York, Pacific Park Brooklyn project, land development operations, Barclays Center arena (sold in January 2016), the Nets (sold in January 2016), and military housing operations (sold in February 2016). In the future, the Company may elect to reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from its TRSs to other subsidiaries, including qualified REIT subsidiaries.

(1) | Square feet of expiring leases and average contractual rent per square foot are operating statistics representing 100% of the square footage and contractual rental income per square foot from expiring leases.


(2) | Contractual rent expiring is an operating statistic and is not comparable to rental revenue, a GAAP financial measure. The primary differences arise because contractual rent is calculated at the Company’s ownership share and excludes adjustments for the impacts of straight-line rent, amortization of intangible assets related to in-place leases, above and below market leases and overage rental payments (which are not reasonably estimable). Contractual rent per square foot includes base rent, fixed additional charges for marketing/promotional charges, common area maintenance and real estate taxes.

Retail
The Retail segment owns, acquires and operates regional malls, specialty/urban retail centers and amenity retail in both urban and suburban locations. The Company opened its first community retail center in 1948 and its first enclosed regional mall in 1962. Since then, it has operated regional malls and specialty retail centers. The specialty retail centers include urban retail, entertainment-based, neighborhood and power centers (collectively, “specialty retail centers”). Amenity retail includes retail and entertainment based tenants typically located within or adjacent to our mixed-use projects. 
In our regional malls, the anchor stores typically own their facilities as an integral part of the mall structure but do not typically generate significant rental revenue to the Company. In contrast, anchor stores at specialty retail centers generally are tenants under long-term leases that typically provide significant rental revenue to the Company.
The Company has pioneered the concept of operating specialty retail centers in urban locations previously ignored by major retailers. With high population densities and disposable income levels at or near those of the suburbs, these urban areas are advantageous for the Company, for the tenants who realize high sales per square foot and for the cities that benefit from the new jobs and incremental tax revenues.
In August 2016, the Company announced its Board of Directors authorized a process to review strategic alternatives for a portion of the retail portfolio. The Company has been exploring a range of options and expects the review process to be concluded by the end of the first quarter of 2017. Assuming the Company identifies and is able to transact on a chosen alternative, or alternatives, the Company’s intent would be to dispose of these retail assets in a tax-deferred manner and redeploy the equity from its retail portfolio into apartment and office assets that align with its focus on primarily core markets and urban, mixed-use placemaking projects, including amenity retail. There can be no assurance that any transaction could be consummated in a tax deferred manner, or at all.

Development 
In its office development activities, the Company is primarily a build-to-suit developer that works with tenants to meet their requirements. The Company’s office development has focused primarily on mixed-use projects in urban developments, often built in conjunction with hotels and/or retail centers or as part of a major office or life science campus. As a result of this focus on urban developments, the Company continues to concentrate future office and mixed-use developments largely in its core markets.
The Company’s retail development activities historically have included building regional malls and specialty/urban retail centers. Regional malls are developed in collaboration with anchor stores that typically own their facilities as an integral part of the mall structure. In contrast, anchor stores at specialty retail centers generally are tenants under long-term leases.
Following the August 2016 announcement to review strategic alternatives for a portion of its retail portfolio, the Company has begun to focus primarily on smaller amenity retail development in conjunction with the development of mixed-use projects whose primary focus is apartments or office rental properties. 
The Company has been engaged in apartment community development for over 60 years and continues to concentrate future apartment community development largely in its core markets.
A summary of development properties at 100% is as follows:

December 31, 2016 | Number of Properties | Number of Units | Gross Leasable Area (in square feet)
Properties Under Construction/Redevelopment: | | | 
Apartments | 9 | | 3,250 | 128,250 
Retail | 2 | | — | 323,150 
Office | 1 | | — | 235,000 
Operating Properties Prior to Stabilization: | | | 
Apartments | 7 | | 2,042 | 43,000 
Office | 2 | | — | 410,000 
Total | 21 | | 5,292 | 1,139,400

The Stapleton project is one of the nation’s largest urban redevelopments with additional future entitlements, including apartments, retail and office space as well as single family neighborhoods, where the Company sells residential lots to homebuilders. The Company controls the future development opportunity at Stapleton through an option agreement. As of December 31, 2016, the Company owns 364 acres of undeveloped land (including 128 saleable acres) and a purchase option for 536 acres at Stapleton over the next two years.
Through December 31, 2016, the Company has purchased 2,399 acres at Stapleton. In addition to the developable land available through purchase options, there are 1,116 acres reserved for regional parks and open space, of which 1,067 acres are currently under construction or have been completed. At December 31, 2016, Stapleton also has approximately 2.5 million square feet of retail space, approximately 400,000 square feet of office space, approximately 2.5 million square feet of other commercial space and 1,608 apartment units completed, with another 399 apartment units under construction. 
Other
The Other segment represents the operations of several non-core investments, including the Barclays Center, a sports and entertainment arena located in Brooklyn, New York (“Arena”) (sold in January 2016), the Company’s equity method investment in the Brooklyn Nets (the “Nets”) (sold in January 2016), and military housing operations (sold in February 2016).
7

Competition
The real estate industry is highly competitive in many markets in which the Company operates. There are numerous other developers, managers and owners of office, retail and apartment real estate and undeveloped land competing with the Company nationally, regionally and/or locally, some of whom may have greater financial resources and market share than the Company. They compete with the Company for management and leasing opportunities, land for development, properties for acquisition and disposition, and for anchor stores and tenants for properties. The Company may not be able to successfully compete in these areas. In addition, competition could over-saturate markets and as a result, the Company may not have sufficient cash to meet the nonrecourse debt service requirements on certain of its properties. Although the Company may attempt to negotiate a restructuring or extension of the nonrecourse mortgage, it may not be successful, which could cause a property to be transferred to the mortgagee.
The Company’s apartment portfolio not only competes against other apartment buildings in the area, but other housing options, such as condominiums and single home ownership. If trends shift more to home ownership instead of rental, the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and realizable value of assets upon disposition could be materially and adversely affected.
Tenants at the Company’s retail properties face continual competition in attracting customers from retailers at other shopping centers, catalogue companies, online merchants, warehouse stores, large discounters, outlet malls, wholesale clubs, direct mail and telemarketers. The Company’s competitors and those of its tenants could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to lease space in its properties and on the rents it can charge or the concessions it may have to grant. These factors could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows, and realizable value of its assets upon sale.
Number of Employees
The Company had 1,936 full-time and 139 part-time employees as of December 31, 2016.
