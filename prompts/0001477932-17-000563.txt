Item 1. Description of Business
Introduction
 
Our Company is a provider of Health and Nutritional supplements and Personal Care products currently sold on the Internet. In June 2014, we suspended our prior sales model which involved sales of our products through another website by means of a network of Direct Sales Associates, or “DSA’s.” In response to the legal action taken by the Chinese authorities that resulted in freezing approximately $3,643,000 of funds held in a Chinese account, since June 2014, we have mainly sold our products over the Internet directly to end-user customers, and sales have decreased in a material amount due to the elimination of the use of DSA’s. 
 
We currently do not use the DSA model in any country, and we cannot predict when, if ever, we will recommence using this model. To date, sales through our website, www.dailynu.com, and our Affiliate Marketing Program (launched in March 2016) have not generated a significant volume of sales, and no assurance can be provided that sales will improve in the near term or long term. 
 
Company History
 
E-World USA Holding, Inc., a California corporation and our predecessor, was established in January 2007. In April 2011, E-World USA Holding, Inc., a California corporation entered into a merger agreement with its wholly-owned subsidiary, E-World USA Holding, Inc., a Nevada corporation, which was the survivor of the merger. Under the Merger Agreement, we issued 90,000,000 shares of our common stock on a one share for one share basis for each share of E-World USA Holding, Inc., a California corporation, common stock issued and outstanding at the date of the merger. In addition, we issued Type A and Type B Warrants in exchange for comparable Warrants issued and outstanding in E-World USA Holding, Inc., a California corporation, at the date of the merger. All Type A and Type B Warrants have been fully exercised, and none are currently issued and outstanding.
 
On October 20, 2014, we established a wholly owned subsidiary, E-World Canada Holding, Inc., for the purpose of acquiring a Company in Canada. Also, on October 24, 2014, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement for the purchase of the outstanding shares of Prime Nutrisource Inc., Nugale Pharmaceutical Inc., and Prime Nutrisource Inc. (New Jersey), in consideration of CAD$2,000,000, the equivalent of $1,766,071, the issuance of a promissory note in the principal amount of CAD$22,780,000, the equivalent of $20,184,902, and the issuance of 25,000,000 exchangeable shares of the Company. In addition, we have agreed to issue to the previous owner of Prime additional shares of exchangeable stock of the Purchaser following the completion of the Offering so that the 25,000,000 exchangeable shares plus such additional shares of exchangeable stock could be exchanged for an aggregate of 25% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of our Company immediately following the completion of the Offering. 
 
On April 21, 2015, we terminated our purchase of the Prime Corporations, and entered into a Termination and Release Agreement with the Prime Corporations, the former owners of the Prime Corporations, Guo Yin Xie, Jian Long, Hong Shu Zhu, 2434689 Ontario Inc., 2434691 Ontario Inc., and 2434694 Ontario Inc., and our subsidiary E-World Canada Holding, Inc.. Upon termination of the agreement:
 


· | Prime subsequently returned CAD$1,500,000 of the CAD$2,000,000 cash portion of the purchase, equivalent to $1,247,920. The 25,000,000 exchangeable shares the Company subsequently were returned to the Company along with the additional contingent consideration of the exchangeable stock for an aggregate of 25% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company immediately following the completion of the Offering.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The promissory note in the principal amount of CAD$22,780,000, the equivalent of $20,201,304, was cancelled. 

Products
 
In June 2014, we suspended our direct marketing model in China in response to the legal action taken by the Chinese authorities. Since June 2014, we have sold our products primarily over the Internet directly to end-user customers. Certain miscellaneous sales are made directly to customers who walk into the Company and customers who call the Company directly for products. We are now focusing on selling Health and Nutritional supplements and Personal Care products directly on the Internet through our website, www.dailynu.com. As of the date of filing of this Report, the Company continues to market its seven individual nutritional supplement products and seven skin-care products on this website. We also sell similar products of third parties on the site. See "Notice to Investors," above.

Company Products
 
Our nutritional supplement products are made according to a micro molecular nutrition formula. To achieve the maximum effect of products, micro molecular health foods were designed to be absorbed by cells directly with minimum chemical conversion which we believe promotes faster absorption. We believe our company is one of only a few companies in the market which are using a small molecular nutrition formula.
 
In November and December 2016, our Dibeier Granules & Oral products successfully passed the inspection by the Shenzhen Academy of Metrology & Qualify Inspection and the Guangdong Quality Supervision and Inspection Institution for Food (Shenzhen). A copy of these two inspection reports are filed as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. As a result, we believe that that our Dibeier Granules & Oral products will be able to be directly exported to the China market and to be sold at nutritional supplement stores in China as food, rather than only through our website. The Company is working to determine which U.S. and Chinese regulatory requirements must be satisfied before it undertakes any exports of the Dibeier products. No assurance can be given that such exports will eventually occur. 
 
The nutritional supplements do not have intellectual property protection for the formulas. Nutritional products consisted of 98% and 81% of total sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 
Our skin-care products were developed, and formulas are owned by, another company from which we purchased the rebranding right. These products focus on restoring epidermal calcium. The products are intended to provide a positive epidermal environment for the homeostasis and regeneration of a person’s own skin barrier. The products were first introduced in 2010 and consisted of 2% and 19% of the 2015 and 2014 annual sales, respectively.
 
Both types of products were previously sold to persons we called members under our currently discontinued model and are now sold directly to end-user customers from our new website and through our Affiliate Marketing Program. See further discussion in the section "Marketing - The Affiliate Marketing Program." 
 
Other Products
 
We sell health and nutrition products manufactured by third parties that are already being sold by third party vendors. E-World has obtained permission from the third party vendors to resell the products on our www.dailynu.com website on a purchase order basis.

 | 2015 | | | 2014
---------------------+------+----+---+-----
Nutritional products | | 98 | % | | 81 | %

Currently, the Company does not have plans to expand its business beyond the nutritional supplement and skin-care sectors, although the Company is now selling products of third party vendors. Less than 1% of our sales in 2015 came from the sale of products of third parties.

Marketing: The Affiliate Marketing Program
 
The Company has alerted investors and others reading this Report about risks related to its Affiliate Marketing Program.
 
See "Notice to Investors," above. 
 
A more complete description of how the AMP operates is as follows:
 


· | The Company’s website (Dailynu.com) is an online shopping store, and everyone in China can purchase the products from this website by credit card; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The Affiliate Marketing Program is a performance-based marketing program in which the Company rewards one or more affiliates (the “Affiliate Members”) for each successful customer purchase brought by the Affiliate Members’ own marketing efforts; 
· | The Company provides the Affiliate Members with a URL (or coupon or advertising banner) which can be shared by the Affiliate Members to anywhere they like to post. If anyone purchases the products from this link, the Company will pay commissions to the relevant Affiliate Members based on the revenue generated from their links; 
· | The Affiliate Members are not employees of the Company; 
· | The Company does not track any customer from the Affiliate Members. Even the Affiliate Members themselves do not know who will purchase the products from the link; 
· | Currently, the Company has two options for the payment of commission rewards. One alternative is that an Affiliate Member may earn 70% of the monthly sales amount generated from his or her affiliate link if that Affiliate Member achieves the total sales in an amount that exceeds $10,000 per month. The other alternative pays every Affiliate Member 20% of the monthly sales amount generated from his or her affiliate link; and
· | The commission rewards are in the form of rebate credits that can be used to order the Company’s products, or the Affiliate Members can request a rebate in cash. 

 
Cost-Per-Sale (CPS) affiliate marketing
 
Based on the description of the Company, the Affiliate Marketing Program appears on its face to be the “Cost-Per-Sale” (CPS) marketing method, a popular internet-based marketing method used by e-commerce companies in China. Under the CPS affiliate marketing method, the cost of advertising is determined by the revenue generated as a result of the advertisement itself. 
 
Relevant Chinese Law
 
The Company’s understanding of Chinese law relevant to current AMP activities is as follows:
 
“Multi-level marketing” (“MLM”) or “pyramid marketing” is not a legal term used under PRC law. However, it is commonly understood as a marketing strategy or salesforce structure in which the sales force is compensated not only for sales they generate, but also for the sales of the other salespeople that they recruit. In this sense, MLM is generally prohibited by the Regulations on Prohibition of Chuanxiao (2005) (“Anti-Chuanxiao Regulations”).
 


7

 
Anti-Chuanxiao Regulations use the simplified Chinese term “Chuanxiao” (mandarin pinyin: “chuán xiāo”) to cover those prohibited fraudulent sales and marketing activities. According to the Anti-Chuanxiao Regulations:
 


· | Article 2 The term "Chuanxiao" in these Regulations means the activities conducted by an organizer or operator who recruits members to gain illegal benefits through such means as calculating and paying to the recruited members remuneration on the basis of the number of members they directly or indirectly recruit or the quantity of sales such members achieve, or requiring the recruited members to pay a certain amount of fees as the condition to obtain membership qualification, thereby disrupting the economic order and impairing social stability.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Article 7 The following activities are Chuanxiao activities: 


1) | The organizer or operator recruits members, requires the recruited to recruit other persons into the organization, calculates and pays to the recruited members remuneration (including material awards and other financial benefits, the same below) on the basis of the number of the members they directly or indirectly recruit progressively, and thus gains illegal benefits;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | The organizer or operator recruits members, requires the recruited member to pay fees or to do so in disguised form by purchasing commodities in order to obtain the membership qualification or the qualification for recruiting other members, and thus gains illegal benefits; and 
3) | The organizer or operator recruits members, requires the recruited member to recruit other persons for forming an upline-and-downline relationship, calculates and pays remuneration to the upline on the basis of the sales achieved by the downline, and thus gains illegal benefits. 

 
According to the above provisions, Anti-Chuanxiao Regulations not only prohibit MLM but also one-level marketing, if the one-level marketing resembles the pattern described in paragraph 2) above.
 
Neither “affiliate marketing” nor CPS is a legal term under PRC law. PRC law, including the Anti-Chuanxiao Regulations, does not classify CPS or this type of marketing method as an illegal marketing activity. Thus it appears that CPS is a neutral internet based marketing tool, and that the legality of the Affiliate Marketing Program largely depends on if it is used for illegal purposes or associated with illegal activities.
 
Potential legal risks in relation to the Affiliate Marketing Program and the activities of the Company and Affiliate Members
 


· | If the Affiliate Marketing Program is misused, the activities of the Company or the Affiliate Members may be regarded as Chuanxiao activities prohibited by the Anti-Chuanxiao Regulations. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Based on the Company’s description of the Affiliate Marketing Program, it appears that the Affiliate Members do not need to pay the Company to join the Affiliate Marketing Program. However, the high percentage commission, especially the 70% commission, may lead to a scenario where the Affiliate Members choose to, or are guided to buy the Company’s products by themselves, with a hope they could earn both a) the high percentage commission under the Affiliate Marketing Program; and b) the profit by selling the products they bought from the Company to third parties. If the Company fails to pay the commission or deliver the products to the Affiliate Members, or if the products delivered are deemed to be illegal or worth significantly less, or if the products are deemed to be a disguise of fraudulent activities, the Affiliate Marketing Program may attract disputes from the Affiliate Members and the Company may be regarded as engaging in Chuanxiao activities according to paragraph 2) of Article 7 of the Anti-Chuanxiao Regulations, which provides “(it is a Chuanxiao activity if) the organizer or operator recruits members, requires the recruited to pay fees or to do so in disguised form by purchasing commodities in order to obtain the membership qualification or the qualification for recruiting other members, and thus gains illegal benefits”. Note under this provision a Chuanxiao activity does not necessarily need to be a multi-level structure and it can be a one-level structure between the Company and the Affiliate Members. Given the high percentage commission of the Affiliate Marketing Program, the Affiliate Members may choose to develop a MLM structure in China by themselves and such activities will fall under the prohibited Chuanxiao activities under the Anti-Chuanxiao Regulations. In addition, the fact that the Company was regarded as a Chuanxiao organization by the local authorities of Zhushan county, Hubei, China, and that a number of the Company’s products were identified to have been used in the previous Chuanxiao activities also adds to the risk that the Company and the Affiliate Members may be regarded as engaging in Chuanxiao activities under the Affiliate Marketing Program. 
· | The activities of the Company and/or the Affiliate Members may be regarded as a breach of the Food Safety Law (2015) (“Food Safety Law”) and other applicable laws, if the health care products and other products of the Company imported into China do not meet relevant legal requirements, or if the Affiliate Members fail to comply with relevant legal requirements in relation to the advertising of these products in China. 


8


 | The Company sells, among other things, health care food to customers in China. Health care food is specially regulated under PRC law and imported health care [food] also needs to meet relevant legal requirements. For example, the Food Safety Law provides that imported health care food is subject to the government’s approval or registration before it can be imported into China; imported food, food additives or food-related products shall meet the national food safety standards of China; imported food and food additives shall pass the testing by the entry-exit inspection and quarantine authorities; the labeling of health care food shall not involve disease prevention and treatment function; and advertising of health care food shall not contain any false information or involve information on disease prevention and treatment functions. The Company also sells cosmetics products to Chinese customers. Imported cosmetics products are also subject to approval/registration requirements and the advertising of cosmetics products also must comply with relevant legal requirements. If any of the Company’s products are regarded as medicine by the PRC authorities, then such products will be subject to stricter legal requirements on its importation, distribution and advertising in China. If any of the PRC legal requirements applicable to the Company’s products are breached, the activities of the Company and/or the Affiliate Members may be regarded as illegal activities, and the products as well as the advertising of the same may be banned in China. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The Affiliate Members’ marketing activities may be regarded as a breach of the Regulations on Administration of Direct Sales (2005) (“Direct Sales Regulations”) because the Company is not licensed to engage in direct sales business in China. 
 | Under the Direct Sales Regulations, only licensed direct sales enterprises can hire direct salespersons to engage in direct sales activities in China. Activities of direct salespersons which are not hired by a licensed direct sales enterprise will be regarded as illegal activities. The term "direct sales" in the Direct Sales Regulations means the method of distribution whereby a direct salesperson recruited by a direct sales enterprise promotes its product, outside any fixed place of business, directly to an ultimate consumer. While one may argue that the Company only engages in online e-commerce activities from outside China and not direct sales activities in China, the above definition of “direct sales” is broad enough to also capture the Affiliate Marketing Program, under which the Affiliate Members promote the Company’s products directly to the Chinese end customers and such marketing would most likely happen in China, away from the United States where the Company’s place of business is located. In theory the Affiliate Members’ marketing activities may be regarded as direct sales activities. As the Company does not hold a license to operate a direct sales business in China, such marketing activities of the Affiliate Members may be regarded as unlicensed illegal direct sales activities. Affiliate Members do not know who will purchase the products from the link assigned to an Affiliate Member. Thus, one may argue that there is no direct sales relationship between the Affiliate Member and the customer and that the Affiliate Members’ marketing activities should not be regarded as direct sales activities. However, the definition of “direct sales” activities under the Direct Sales Regulations is broad enough to also cover online purchases by a customer, even if he does not know the relevant Affiliate Member. In addition, as the Affiliate Members also organize free seminars to attract potential customers, a direct sales relationship may be regarded to exist in this scenario. Further, because of the high percentage commissions, the Affiliate Members may have the motive to market the Company’s products to anyone he knows. The direct sales relationship may also be regarded to exist in this scenario. Further, as the Company is not registered in China and not eligible to apply for or hold the licenses and approvals needed to engage in e-commerce activities in China, if the Affiliate Members are accused of engaging in direct sales activities, they have no defense that they are promoting an e-commerce company recognized by the PRC. 

Sourcing and Production
 
Our Products
 
In order to maintain high product quality, we anticipated that we would manufacture our products upon successful completion of our acquisition of Prime. As we terminated such acquisition in April 20, 2015, we currently do not manufacture and do not intend in the future to manufacture any of the products we sell. Instead, we acquire our ingredients from the suppliers and contract for production of our proprietary products from the manufacturers that we believe are reliable, reputable and deliver high quality materials, products and service. In 2015, three suppliers, SUSS Technology Corp., Taiwan K.K. Corp and V-Plus Trading Inc., accounted for approximately 71.8% of our purchases. In 2014, two suppliers, SUSS Technology Corp and Maxsun Industries, Inc., accounted for approximately 74.2% of our purchases. The loss of one or more suppliers could result in a potential loss of our sales and revenues if we cannot find a substitute.

9

 
The Company does not have a written or contractual agreement with our other suppliers, or manufacturers. Our product ingredient sourcing and other manufacturing requirements are conducted on a purchase-order basis. If one or more of our current suppliers stopped selling us ingredients and/or if one or more of our current manufacturers stopped manufacturing our products, we would be forced to find other suppliers and manufacturers. The time needed to find other suppliers or manufactures could outlast the inventory on hand and result in loss of sales.
 
We maintain a good relationship with our suppliers and do not anticipate that any of our suppliers will terminate the relationship in the near term. We also have ongoing relationships with secondary and tertiary suppliers. In the event we become unable to source any products or ingredients from our major suppliers, we believe that we would be able to produce or replace those products or substitute source these ingredients from our secondary and tertiary other suppliers without great difficulty or significant increases to our cost of goods sold.
 
Our Skin-care products are developed by a company which owns the intellectual property for those products. We purchased the rebranding right from them to sell these products under our names. Currently we only have one supplier for our skin-care products, and the specific product is solely owned by this supplier. If the supplier were to discontinue this product, we would need to find a substitute supplier for a similar product. We have not identified any substitute supplier or substitute product.
 
For nutritional products, we purchase our ingredients from third parties and contract with a third party manufacturer for further processing the material into final products to be sold. We do not own a manufacturing plant for processing of our products. We only provide self-developed formulas to be manufactured. Our company is able to obtain the ingredients necessary for production of our nutritional supplements. Our skin-care products are produced by our supplier, and we are unable to obtain the intellectual property rights to produce such products.
 
We also maintain a good relationship with our manufacturers and do not anticipate that any of our manufacturers will terminate our relationship in the near term. In the event we become unable have our products manufactured by our major manufacturers, we believe that we would be able to reallocate production to our other manufacturers or locate other manufacturers without great difficulty or significant increases to our cost of goods sold.
 
Other Products
 
We currently acquire other products we sell from third party vendors on a wholesale basis and then resell them on our website. We acquire most of these products on a purchase order basis. A small amount of products is purchased and stored in our warehouse. Less than 1% of our sales in 2015 and 2014 came from these products.
Order Backlog
 
We have no current order backlog.
 
Industry Analysis
 
The nutrition industry includes many small and medium sized companies that manufacture and distribute products generally intended to enhance the body’s performance and wellness. The four major product categories within the nutrition industry are:

· | Nutritional Supplements – products such as vitamins, minerals, nutritional supplements, herbs and botanicals and compounds derived from these substances.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Natural and Organic Foods – products such as cereals, milk, non-diary beverages and frozen entrees. 
· | Functional Foods – products with added ingredients or fortification specifically for health or performance purposes. 
· | Skin-care – products combining nutrition with skin care. 

 
The nutritional supplement market is characterized by:
 


· | Large selections of essentially similar products that are difficult to differentiate.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Retail consumers’ emphasis on value pricing. 
· | Constantly changing formulations based on evolving scientific research. 


10


· | Low entry barriers resulting from low brand loyalty, rapid change, widely available manufacturing, low regulatory requirements and ready access to large distribution channels, such as the Internet and retail stores selling nutritional supplements and other direct marketing companies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | A lack of uniform standards regarding product ingredient sources, potency, purity, absorption rate and form. 

Marketing Plan
 
The Company promotes its products through its website and newspaper advertisements. During the early stages of implementation of the website, the Company offered coupon codes for certain products to generate sales and website traffic but has since discontinued this practice.
 
The majority of the Company’s sales are generated from China for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
 
Since June 2014, we have mainly sold our products over the Internet directly to end-user customers through our web site, www.dailynu.com. In March 2016, we launched an Affiliate Marketing Program. See Marketing: The Affiliate Marketing Program in the aforementioned section above.
 
In addition, we believe that consumers have become more confident in ordering products, like ours, over the Internet. However, the nutritional supplement and skin care product e-business markets have been, and continue to be, increasingly competitive and are rapidly evolving. 
 
The Company hopes to export its Dibeier products into China to be sold over-the-counter in retail locations such as nutritional product stores, rather than only through our website. The Company is currently examining the regulations that may apply to the export of Dibeier products, but no assurance can be given that the export of such products will occur in the future. 
 
Competition
 
The market for nutritional products is large and intensely competitive. The Company competes directly with companies that manufacture and market nutritional products. The Company competes with other companies in the nutritional products industry by emphasizing the uniqueness, value and premium quality of the Company's products and convenience of the Company's Internet sales system. Many of the Company's competitors have much greater name recognition and financial resources than the Company. In addition, nutritional products can be purchased in a wide variety of channels of distribution. While the Company believes that consumers appreciate the convenience of ordering products from home through the Internet, the buying habits of many consumers accustomed to purchasing products through traditional retail channels are difficult to change. The Company's product offerings are also relatively small compared to the wide variety of products offered by many other nutritional product companies.
Intellectual Property
 
We have no registered or patented intellectual property in the United States. We have common law ownership rights for the formulations for six of our seven non-cosmetic products.
 
The Company has obtained in China a Trademark Registration for the name of “Dibeier” (or mandarin pinyin: “Nuo Lin”) with trademark application number 20669799 as set forth in Exhibit 10.3. Under China law, this trademark is valid for an indefinite period, as there is no expiration date. 
 
The Company has obtained in China a Trademark Registration for the name of “DailyNu” with trademark application number 20683305 as set forth in Exhibit 10.4. Under China law, this trademark is valid for an indefinite period, as there is no expiration date. 
 
Other than the aforementioned trademarks, we do not own any other registered trademarks, trade names or other governmentally approved intellectual property rights for those products.
 
The three types of cosmetics products have formulation patents owned by our supplier of these products, Genepharm Inc. manufactures these products and packages them with Company designed packaging under an oral agreement with us. The formulation of the O2 Cell Power product is owned by Oxygen America, Inc., which manufactures this product and packages it with Company designed packaging under an oral agreement with us. We are authorized by these suppliers under oral agreements to sell these products worldwide under our brand name without infringing any rights of Genepharm or Oxygen America, Inc.

Research and Development
 
We are not currently conducting any research and development activities.
 
Government Regulation
 
Given uncertainties as to full compliance with network marketing laws in foreign jurisdictions, in 2014, the Company discontinued sales through the network marketing model and began selling directly to end-user customers from its new website. See "Notice to Investors," above.
 
We believe we are no longer subject to network marketing regulations. Nonetheless, we are still subject to federal, state, local and foreign regulations. Various governmental agencies have an impact on our business. The regulations cover product ingredients, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, sales, compensation and taxation, to name a few. If the Company were to fail to meet standards set by these regulations, then the Company could be prohibited from selling its products. See “Notice to Investors” above, and “Potential legal risks in relation to the Affiliate Marketing Program and the activities of the Company and Affiliate Members,” above.

 
The Company hopes to export its Dibeier products into China to be sold over-the-counter in retail locations such as nutritional product stores, rather than only through our website. Under China Law, in order to import these products into China, the Company must provide the Inspection Report from Provincial Quality Supervision and Inspection Institution obtained in November and December 2016 (as set forth in Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2), the Product Chinese Name registration (as set forth in Exhibit 10.3) obtained in September 2016 and the Trademark registration (as set forth in Exhibit 10.4) obtained in September 2016 from the Trademark Office of State Administration for Industry & Commerce of China to the importer in China. The Company currently has no binding contracts or agreement with any person or entity in China to purchase and import the Dibeier products. The Company is currently reviewing U.S. and Chinese import/export regulations regarding the sale of Dibeier products and will not commence the export and sale of Dibeier products until it believes that it is in compliance with these regulations. Additional information concerning this matter will be made available in the Company’s future SEC reports.
 
Employees
 
We have the following employees:
 


· | Full time: 4 
--+-------------------
· | Operations – 1 
· | Administrative – 1
· | Management – 1 
· | Sales – 1 

 
We have no collective bargaining agreement with our employees. We consider our relationship with our employees to be excellent.
