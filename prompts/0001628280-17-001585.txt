GENERAL BUSINESS INFORMATION
Lydall holds a number of patents, trademarks and licenses. While no single patent, trademark or license is critical to the success of Lydall, together these intangible assets are of considerable value to the Company.
Typically, the Company’s business can be slightly stronger in the first half of the calendar year given the timing of customer order patterns and planned customer shutdowns in North America and Europe that typically occur in the third and fourth quarters of each year. Lydall maintains levels of inventory and grants credit terms that are normal within the industries it serves. The Company uses a wide range of raw materials in the manufacturing of its products, including aluminum and other metals to manufacture most of its automotive heat shields and various glass and petroleum derived fibers in its Performance Materials, Technical Nonwovens, and Thermal/Acoustical Fibers segments. The majority of raw materials used are generally available from a variety of suppliers.
Sales to Ford Motor Company accounted for 19.6%, 18.2% and 16.5% of Lydall’s net sales in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. No other customers accounted for more than 10% of Lydall's net sales in such years. Foreign and export sales were 46.9% of net sales in 2016, 44.2% in 2015, and 46.2% in 2014. Foreign sales were $212.5 million, $179.6 million and $190.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Export sales primarily to Canada, Mexico, Asia and Europe were $53.2 million, $52.5 million, and $57.6 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in foreign sales during 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily related to the acquisition of Texel on July 7, 2016.
Foreign operations generated operating income of $4.9 million, $6.4 million, and $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Total foreign assets were $317.8 million, $144.2 million, and $155.9 million at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in foreign assets in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the acquisitions of Texel and Gutsche. For further detail regarding revenue and financial information about the Company’s geographic areas, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company invested $9.0 million in 2016, $8.5 million in 2015, and $9.0 million in 2014, or approximately 2% of net sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014, in research and development to create new products and to improve existing products. All amounts were expensed as incurred. Most of the investment in research and development is application specific. There were no customer-sponsored research and development activities during the past three years.
Backlog at January 31, 2017 was $95.9 million. Lydall’s backlog was $94.9 million at December 31, 2016, $72.2 million at December 31, 2015, and $74.8 million at December 31, 2014. The increase in backlog at year-end 2016 compared to year-end 2015 was primarily driven by the addition of the Texel and Gutsche businesses. Thermal/Acoustical Metals and Thermal/Acoustical Fibers segment backlog, which comprises the majority of total backlog, may be impacted by various assumptions, including future automotive production volume estimates, changes in program launch timing and changes in customer development plans. The Company believes that global automotive orders for a two month period represent a reasonable timeframe to be deemed as firm orders and are included as Thermal/Acoustical Metals and Thermal/Acoustical Fibers segment backlog. There are minimal seasonal aspects to Lydall’s backlog.
No material portion of Lydall’s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of any governmental body.
Lydall believes that its plants and equipment are overall, in substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment (See Item 3, Legal Proceedings).
As of December 31, 2016, Lydall employed approximately 2,700 people. Three unions with contracts expiring on September 30, 2020 represent approximately 60 employees in the United States. All employees at the facilities in France and the Netherlands are covered under a National Collective Bargaining Agreement. Certain salaried and all hourly employees in Germany, the United Kingdom, China and Canada are also covered under some form of a National Collective Bargaining Agreement. Lydall considers its employee relationships to be satisfactory.
There are no significant anticipated operating risks related to foreign investment law, expropriation, or availability of material, labor or energy. The foreign and domestic operations attempt to limit foreign currency exchange transaction risk by completing transactions in functional currencies whenever practical or through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts when deemed appropriate.
