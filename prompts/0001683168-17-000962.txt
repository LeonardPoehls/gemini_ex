ITEM 1.          BUSINESS
 
When used in this report, the terms “Global”, “Company”, “we”, “our or “us” mean, unless the context otherwise indicates, Global Future City Holding Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Risk Factors presented in Item 1A of Part I and the Cautionary Statement for Forward-Looking Information and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in Item 7 of Part II.
 
Corporate History
 
Our Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 12, 2000 under the name Cogen Systems, Inc. We changed our name to Snocone Systems, Inc. on December 6, 2001. On April 1, 2005, Snocone Systems, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, WYD Acquisition Corp., a California corporation (the “Merger Sub”), merged with Who’s Your Daddy, Inc. (“WYD”), an unrelated, privately held California corporation, whereby the Merger Sub merged with and into WYD. After the merger, WYD continued its corporate existence as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Snocone Systems, Inc. under the laws of the State of California. On April 13, 2005, we changed our name to Who’s Your Daddy, Inc. and, effective June 1, 2010, we changed our name to FITT Highway Products, Inc. Effective October 29, 2013, we merged with F.I.T.T. Energy Products, Inc. (“FITT”) whereby FITT merged into our Company, with our Company being the surviving entity. Effective October 29, 2014 the name of our Company was changed to Global Future City Holding Inc. (the “Company” or “we”) and our trading symbol changed from “FHWY” to “FTCY.”
Detention of our Former Chief Executive Officer
 
On August 30, 2016, we reported on Form 8-K that our former Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), President, and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Ning Liu, was detained in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and we had begun investigating the facts and circumstances surrounding his detainment. On September 9, 2016, we filed Form 8-K reporting that Mr. Liu was taking a 30 day leave of absence from all positions he held with our Company. Finally, on October 21, 2016, because of his ongoing legal challenges in the PRC, Mr. Liu resigned from all his positions in our Company. Also on October 21, 2016, our Board of Directors appointed Michael R. Dunn to the positions of Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), President and Chairman of the Board.
 
Mr. Liu continues to be detained in the PRC. We have been informed by Mr. Liu’s attorney in the PRC that, on March 2, 2017, he was convicted in Hunan Province for violations of the PRC’s multi-level marketing regulations and sentenced to 10 years in prison. We have likewise been informed by Mr. Liu’s attorney that he has an appeal hearing scheduled in Hunan Province in the near future and, if he is unsuccessful in that hearing, he can appeal to a national court in Beijing China. This process could take months and it is very difficult to get reliable information on the particulars of Mr. Liu’s case to make any intelligent assessment as to the final outcome. While many of the facts of his detention and conviction are unclear, we have been informed that Mr. Liu allegedly raised capital through the sale of a digital coin, named Wan Fu Bi, all while representing himself as the CEO of our Company and an unaffiliated private company, Great Coin Inc. (“Great Coin”). As further described below, Great Coin, which was co-owned by Mr. Liu and Michael Dunn, is a technology company that developed the GX Coin, a digital currency, and a trading platform for the GX Coin. Through a February 2016 agreement with Great Coin, our Company’s direct-selling program members were able to convert a portion of their membership accounts into GX Coins. It is unclear whether investors in Wan Fu Bi believed it was the same as the GX Coin. Even though Mr. Liu was allegedly representing himself as the CEO of our Company and also of Great Coin, his activities were never authorized by either company, Wan Fu Bi has no affiliation with either company or Michael Dunn, and no funds resulting from the alleged activities were ever received by our Company, Great Coin or Michael Dunn.
 
While no actions have been filed against our Company as a result of Mr. Liu’s actions, his detention and legal challenges have had, and continue to have, a material adverse impact on us. We believe that potential business partners have refused and or avoided doing business with us due to Mr. Liu’s actions. Our efforts to implement our direct selling program became significantly more difficult due to questions surrounding Mr. Liu’s detention. In addition, our investment in Global Future City Regional LLC, an EB-5 Regional Center, was significantly impaired due to Mr. Liu’s actions, and potential project partners decided to investigate their opportunities elsewhere.

While Mr. Liu is no longer involved with our Company, many potential investors and strategic partners, particularly those in the PRC, became distrustful of us, resulting in significant harm to our credibility, our brand and our ability to raise capital. As a result of Mr. Liu’s alleged actions, we were forced to suspend our direct selling program (the “GX-Life Direct Selling Program”) in the fourth quarter of 2016 and to abandon and write-off our investment in our EB-5 Regional Center line of business. We believe Mr. Liu’s alleged actions were the primary factor in our stock price falling from a high of $3.64 per share in the first quarter of 2016 to a low of $0.51 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016, causing us to experience significant lost opportunities to raise capital. In addition, after focusing a significant portion of our resources for several months attempting to redirect our marketing strategy to an online sales program with little success, we were forced to lay off a majority of our employees in January 2017 to reduce costs to a minimal level.
 
In response to Mr. Liu’s alleged actions and their significant harm to our Company, on March 20, 2017 we entered into a Stock Issuance Cancellation Agreement with Mr. Liu and certain of his affiliates (the “Stockholders”) under which the Stockholders agreed to return 8,349,906 common shares owned by them to our Company for cancellation. We retain the right in the future to bring actions against Mr. Liu for any and all further damages his alleged actions may have caused. In a separate agreement, Mr. Liu also relinquished his 50% ownership in Great Coin to Mr. Dunn and Mr. Dunn retains the right to bring future actions against Mr. Liu for any damages his alleged actions may have caused.
 
Business Summary
 
We are a holding company currently focused in the area of consumer product sales through our wholly-owned subsidiary, GX-Life Global, Inc. (“GX-Life”). During late 2015 and early 2016, we spent considerable resources developing the GX-Life Direct Selling Program, including hiring specialized staff and retaining legal counsel with direct sales program experience. Our goal was to implement the GX-Life Direct Selling Program initially in both the U.S. and China and then, if successful, to expand it internationally. As a result of Mr. Liu’s alleged actions, as described above, we were forced to suspend the GX-Life direct selling program in the fourth quarter of 2016. We are currently pursuing relationships with a number of sales organizations who can purchase our existing inventory for resale purposes in an attempt to establish a wholesale relationship with these organizations. We believed that gaining consumer acceptance in this way would allow us to overcome any difficulties encountered in our direct-selling business.
 
We were previously also focused in the area of EB-5 investments for foreign investors who are interested in acquiring lawful permanent residence in the United States through our acquisition of Global Future City Regional Center LLC. However, with the difficulties encountered because of Mr. Liu’s detention resulting from his alleged actions, we have begun the process of looking into alternative strategies to utilize or sell our EB-5 Regional Center. We may not be able to utilize or find a buyer for the EB-5 Regional Center and cannot determine at this point whether it has any value at all.
 
Prior Acquisitions and Agreements
 
We entered into the following agreements that helped pave and shape our business in its current direction:
 
Sky Rover Stock Purchase Agreement
 
On April 17, 2015, we completed the closing of a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with Sky Rover Holdings, Ltd., a corporation formed under the laws of the Republic of Seychelles (“Sky Rover”). Under the SPA, certain unaffiliated parties (collectively, the “Acquiring Shareholders”) cumulatively acquired approximately 87.3% of the outstanding shares of stock of our Company in exchange for our receipt of $400,000 in cash and the contribution of 4,000,000 E-Gold crypto-assets (“EGD”) to our then wholly-owned subsidiary, Global Modern Enterprise Limited, a Hong Kong entity (the “EGD Subsidiary”). In connection with the closing of the SPA, Mr. Lei Pei, an officer of Sky Rover, purchased 6,000,000 newly-issued shares of our common stock for $3,000,000 cash in a separate transaction that closed on March 30, 2015, which was meant to provide working capital for our business. Additionally, Mr. Pei, provided the initial down payment of $150,000 for the acquisition of Global Future City Regional Center, LLC (f/k/a Powerdyne Regional Center, LLC) which is described below. On August 17, 2015, Mr. Pei, resigned from our Company as its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chairman, and sold the 6,000,000 shares he owned in our Company in a private transaction.
 
In connection with the share purchase by Sky Rover, we intended to offer EGD in connection with a reward program (“Rewarded EGD”). We attempted to gain additional assurance that any sale or use of the EGD was in compliance with existing securities regulations, and on February 10, 2015, we filed a Request for No-Action relief (the “No-Action Request”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to obtain clarification that the SEC would not recommend enforcement action against us and our related subsidiaries regarding our use of the EGD. However, we were not able to obtain any such assurance or clarification, and we spun-off our EGD-related holdings on October 2, 2015 (as further explained below), and withdrew the No-Action Request on October 8, 2015.

GX-Life Share Exchange Agreement
 
On October 2, 2015, we completed a Share Exchange Agreement with GX-Life , whereby we spun-off 100% of our ownership interest in the EGD Subsidiary (including the 4,000,000 EGD received under the SPA) in exchange for 100% of the outstanding common stock of GX-Life, a private company owned primarily by Ning Liu, and our CEO/CFO, Michael Dunn. GX-Life has developed a platform to support direct-selling opportunities throughout the world (the “GX-Life Direct Selling Program”).
 
In a related transaction, on October 2, 2015, the former shareholders of GX-Life sold all of their interests in the EGD Subsidiary to the Acquiring Shareholders in the Sky Rover SPA in exchange for 21,280,000 shares of our Company’s common stock previously acquired in the Sky Rover SPA. Collectively, these two transactions are referred to as the “GX-Life Transactions”. As a result of the GX-Life Transactions, much of the Sky Rover SPA has been effectively unwound, as our Company (i) did not create three (3) of the four (4) subsidiaries it had intended to create under the SPA, (ii) did not receive the IP Technology that was intended to calculate Rewarded EGD, and (iii) no longer owns or controls the EGD Subsidiary or the 4,000,000 EGD crypto-assets it received under the Sky Rover SPA. Furthermore, of the four (4) entities that received shares in our Company (Future Continental Limited, Discover Future Limited, Global Future Development Limited, and Master Power Holdings Group), only Master Power Holdings Group retained the 9,120,000 shares it received under the Sky Rover SPA.
 
The GX-Life Transactions effected a change in control of our Company, as the former shareholders of GX-Life acquired 21,280,000 shares of our common stock representing an aggregate voting power of 44.7%. Individually, following the GX-Life Transactions, (i) Michael Dunn held a total of 24.1% of the voting power of our common stock, (ii) Ning Liu held a total of 2.6% of the voting power of our common stock, and (iii) Tomoe Masuya held a total of 32.9% of the voting power of our common stock. The former shareholders of GX-Life are all unaffiliated from one another and disclaim status as a "group" as defined by SEC Rules under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act.
 
As described above, we had previously intended to market EGD in connection with a reward program. GX-Life believes that incorporating a crypto-asset other than EGD into a reward program would be important to GX-Life’s success. As a result, on October 21, 2015, GX-Life entered into a subscription agreement (the “Subscription Agreement”) with Great Coin. Great Coin is a technology development company that focuses on the development of “GX Coins”, a cryptocurrency that functions as a store of value and medium of exchange, and the associated online cryptocurrency platform (the “GX Coin Platform”). Great Coin intends for GX Coins, as a cryptocurrency, to be tradable on the GX Coin Platform that is open to the public, and the ownership and transfer of GX Coins is intended to be recorded on an encrypted, distributed ledger system that is based on blockchain technology developed and made available by Ethereum Foundation, a Switzerland company (“Ethereum”). The software utilized by Ethereum to record GX Coin transactions on the GX Coin Platform is developed by third parties that are beyond the control of our Company, its subsidiaries, or Great Coin, and may contain material defects and vulnerabilities. In the event that Ethereum or its software changes, becomes obsolete, gets regulated adversely in one more jurisdictions, does not meet the expectations of its users, or suffers a breach in security, such event may have an adverse effect on the value of GX Coin and thereby our business.
 
Great Coin has created seventy-five million (75,000,000) GX Coins using 256-bit encryption. To incorporate GX Coins into GX-Life's new business model, GX-Life originally agreed to purchase 5,000,000 GX Coins, at a price of $0.50 per GX Coin, for a total price of $2,500,000. In October 2015, GX-Life paid Great Coin $350,000 for 700,000 GX Coins under the Subscription Agreement. However, while Great Coin retained the $350,000 that was paid, the GX Coins were never delivered to GX-Life. Instead, the Subscription Agreement was superseded and replaced on February 17, 2016 by a Software License and Services Agreement (the “Services Agreement”) between GX-Life and Great Coin, as amended on June 30, 2016 (the “Access and Services Agreement”). Under the Access and Services Agreement, GX-Life agreed to pay an upfront fee of $350,000 which was deemed paid by GX-Life's previous payment made to Great Coin in October 2015, and the remaining obligations under the Subscription Agreement were canceled. The material difference(s) between the License Agreement and Access and Services Agreement is that under the Access and Services Agreement, (i) GX-Life Members receive their entire commissions in the form of GX-Coins as stated in the conversion notice provided to GX-Life rather than receiving their entire commissions in the form of GX-Coins over the course of twenty weeks, and (ii) clarifies that the conversion fee paid by GX-Life to Great Coin shall be calculated without any reference to any discounts, rewards, or incentives that a GX-Life Member may receive under the GX-Life Global Compensation Plan.
 
Under the Access and Services Agreement, Great Coin has agreed to make available and manage the GX Coin Platform, in connection with which GX-Life Members will be able to receive their commissions in the form of either a debit card, Automatic Clearing House (“ACH”) deposit, or GX Coins. The GX Coin Platform will also allow GX-Life Members to sell GX Coins to other users of the GX Coin Platform, including the public and other GX-Life Members.

Acquisition of Global Future City Regional Center, LLC (formerly, Powerdyne Regional Center, LLC)
 
On March 26, 2015, we entered into a Membership Interest Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Membership PSA”) with Powerdyne, Inc. (the “Selling Entity”), an entity which owned 100% of the membership interests in Powerdyne Regional Center, LLC (“Powerdyne” or “Regional Center”). Powerdyne is an EB-5 Regional Center (USCIS ID Number 1215250671) that was approved on March 28, 2013 by the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Service (“USCIS”). The closing (“Closing”) of the Membership PSA occurred on March 27, 2015.
 
Under the terms of the Membership PSA, we purchased 100% of the membership interest of Powerdyne (the “Purchased Membership Interest”) from the Selling Entity for the total purchase price of $250,000 (the “Purchase Price”) of which $125,000 (the “Deposit”) was paid by us at the Closing with the balance to be paid in five (5) quarterly installments of $25,000 (the “Installment Payments”) due on April 1, 2015, July 1, 2015, October 1, 2015, January 1, 2016, and April 1, 2016. As collateral for the timely payment of the Installment Payments, we pledged and granted a security interest in the Purchased Membership Interest of Powerdyne to the Selling Entity, until the Purchase Price was paid in full. As of the date of this filing, all remaining payments have been made for total payments of $250,000.
 
Shortly after the Closing, we submitted an Amendment to Articles of Organization (the “Amended Articles”) of Powerdyne to change its name to “Global Future City Regional Center, LLC” to better align its identity and brand with the public company. Such Amended Articles was filed and approved by the California Secretary of State on April 9, 2015.
 
As discussed above, due to the difficulties encountered because of Mr. Liu’s detention resulting from his alleged actions, we have commenced looking at alternative strategies to utilize or sell our interest in Powerdyne. However, because of the inactivity of the Regional Center, the USCIS has considered the project frozen, and accordingly, the value it may have to a third party may minimal until conditions change.
 
Prior Operations - FITT Energy
 
Historically, we marketed and distributed three, two-ounce energy drink shots marketed under the FITT Energy brand. All three energy shots were designed in collaboration with Dr. Rand Scott, a Board Certified Anesthesiologist and Pain Management Specialist who has experience with the use of herbal products. At the recommendation of Dr. Scott, we incorporated a number of ingredients into the FITT Energy products to reduce the amount of caffeine in each product.
 
Although we have implemented new business operations as outlined above, we have retained the FITT Energy drink brand by incorporating the sale of FITT energy drinks into the GX-Life direct-selling program as well as the online program selling direct to consumers.
 
Current Business Operations
 
GX-Life Operations (Consumer Products)
 
GX-Life is our wholly-owned subsidiary selling a variety of consumer products which are described below. GX-Life began offering its products using a direct-selling platform to support sales opportunities throughout the world (the “GX-Life Direct Selling Program”). The GX-Life Direct Selling Program incorporated the use of GX Coins to allow its members to receive rewards, commissions and other forms of compensation. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we suspended the GX-Life Direct Selling Program due to difficulties resulting from Mr. Liu’s detention, as previously described. We may decide to reactivate this program in the future, but such reactivation cannot be assured.
 
In its place, we retained a consulting firm with significant experience in online sales to help us develop an online direct-to-consumer sales program (“GX-Life D2C Program”) to sell our products. After spending considerable resources in connection with this program, we were unable to generate any appreciable results and have now abandoned this potential sales avenue.
 
We are currently pursuing relationships with a number of sales organizations who can purchase our existing inventory for resale purposes in an attempt to establish a wholesale relationship with these organizations as well as liquidate large quantities of inventory to extract value before certain of the product reach an expiration date. Given the damage done to our Company’s credibility by Mr. Liu’s actions and detention, there is no assurance that we will be successful in this endeavor.
 
GX-Life Products
 
Below is a list of products offered by GX-Life. These products were formulated mainly for the market in China and packaged with our direct selling program in mind.

GX-Life offers high quality consumer products concentrated in the areas of beauty, nutrition, energy drinks, and tea under the brand, “GX-Life”. Products have historically been sold via GX-Life’s Direct Selling Program to GX-Life Members and consumers and e-commerce channels on an international basis. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we suspended the GX-Life Direct Selling Program and are pursuing wholesale avenues.
 
GX-Life obtains its beauty products of high-end moisturizers, serums, and creams designed to protect the skin and combat the signs of aging from Advanced Medical Research Laboratories, Inc. (“AMR”). AMR is a health and beauty contract manufacturer that creates beauty product formulas using the latest innovations in active ingredients. In this regard, GX-Life uses AMR’s services to create unique beauty formulas for all of GX-Life’s beauty products, including its foaming cleanser, night cream, eye cream, regenerative pump, and skin pump, and tailors each beauty product’s look, feel, bottling, labeling, and packaging according to GX-Life’s instructions. After a finished product is made, GX-Life places purchases orders to AMR to acquire beauty product inventory that GX-Life sells to its customers.
 
In a similar fashion to GX-Life’s beauty products, GX-Life obtains its nutraceutical products from VFR Import Export, Inc (“VFR”). VFR is a vitamin and supplement contract manufacturer. In this regard, GX-Life uses VFR’s services to create unique formulas for all of GX-Life’s nutraceutical products, including its slim down caplets, berry shake, multi-vitamin, joint tablets, detox softgels, enxymas capsules, and probiotic capsules, and tailors each nutraceutical product’s taste, labeling, bottling, and packaging according to GX-Life’s instructions. After a finished product is made, GX-Life places purchases orders to VFR to acquire nutraceutical product inventory that GX-Life sells to its customers.
 
Unlike GX-Life’s beauty and nutraceutical products, GX-Life created the formulas for its energy drink products which include GX-Life Sustain, GX-Life F.I.T.T. Extreme, and GX-Life F.I.T.T. Rx Gel packs in collaboration with Dr. Rand Scott. GX-Life provides Universal Nutrients, LLC, a contract manufacturer (“Universal Nutrients”), the raw materials, formulas, and instructions needed to create each energy drink. In order to obtain energy drink products, GX-Life merely places a purchase order and provides the raw materials to Universal Nutrients to create the energy drink product that GX-Life then sells to its customers.

GX-Life obtains its tea products from Guangdong Authenmole Biotech, Inc. (“Authenmole”), a tea manufacturer located in the People’s Republic of China, to provide single-serve sachets of six Authentea® organic tea extracts, and three Herbalsoul herbal tea extracts, in addition to various teawares. GX-Life has no input on these products as GX-Life merely acts as a reseller of the tea products manufactured and produced by Authenmole.
 
More information about GX-Life and the products that it offers can be found on our website at: www.gx-life.com
 
GX-Life Direct-Selling Program
 
The GX-Life Direct Selling Program was developed to support sales opportunities throughout the world. Under the program, enrolled members received various benefits depending on their enrolled status (based on each member’s deposit). Benefits were calculated under a compensation plan which was based on most recent industry developments and best practices for direct selling programs, and benefits included product discounts, bonuses, commissions, etc. Our program also incorporated the use of GX Coins as part of an award structure.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2016, we suspended the GX-Life Direct Selling Program due to difficulties resulting from Mr. Liu’s detention, as previously described, and we may or may not reactivate the program in the future. If we reactivate the program, we will again be subject to all regulations, both foreign and domestic, governing direct selling programs.
 
Prior to the suspension of the GX-Life Direct Selling Program, members had made deposits, net of repayments, of $5.2 million into the program, $4.7 million of which was converted into GX Coins in accordance with the terms of a February 17, 2016 License Agreement between GX-Life and Great Coin. The amount not converted into GX Coins, approximately $551,000, is reflected in Member Deposits as a current liability on our consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016.
 
As of December 31, 2016, GX-Life had 111 accounts established under this program, 66 of which were held by residents of China and the remainder by residents of the United States. With the exception of repayment of the Member Deposit current liability described above, we have met all of our obligations to the program’s account holders due to the suspension of the program.
 
GX Coins
 
GX-Life entered into an Access and Services Agreement (see discussion above) with Great Coin that would allow GX-Life to distribute rewards to GX-Life Members in the form of GX Coins. GX Coin is a cryptocurrency that functions as a store of value and medium of exchange that was created by Great Coin and is intended to be traded on the GX Coin Platform, where the price of GX Coin may fluctuate depending on traditional market forces. GX-Life intends to use GX Coins as part of the GX-Life Global Compensation Plan for GX-Life Members. In order to qualify for GX Coin related benefits, receive GX-Coins, or participate on the GX-Coin Platform (collectively, the “GX-Coin Benefits”), GX-Life Members must reside in a state or territory where Great Coin is approved and authorized to conduct business. Currently, only GX-Life Members who reside in California are eligible to receive the GX-Coin Benefits within the United States. GX-Life Members who reside in China may receive GX-Coin Benefits as well. All other GX-Life Members that reside outside of California or China will not be eligible to receive GX-Coin Benefits, and must receive their commissions in the form of a debit card or ACH deposit until Great Coin is approved and authorized to conduct business in the state or territory where such GX-Life Member resides.
 
GX-Life Direct-to-Consumer Program
 
After suspending our Direct Selling Program in the fourth quarter of 2016, we retained a consulting firm, Digital Market Labs (“DML”), to help us develop an online direct-to-consumer sales program (“GX-Life D2C Program”) to sell our products. DML has significant experience in online sales and had developed numerous similar programs for other clients in the past. Based on their prior experience, DML stated that we should expect an approximate 1.5% conversion ratio for each online target. During a three-month period from late 2016 to early 2017 we focused a significant portion of our resources to redesigning our products’ packaging and advertising for the online consumer and, in the end, our results were minimal. We have since abandoned this effort due to DML’s estimated sales estimates not being met. As a result, we were forced to lay off a majority of our employees in January 2017 to reduce costs to a minimal level.
 
GX-Life Wholesale Program
 
We currently are pursuing relationships with a number of sales organizations who can purchase our existing inventory for resale purposes in an attempt to establish a wholesale relationship with these organizations. This would allow us to take advantage of established sales networks and, if successful, create a sustainable stream of revenue. We believe this approach gives us the best opportunity for future success at the least cost. There is no assurance that we will be successful in this endeavor.

Regulation of GX-Life’s Products – United States and Overseas
 
Although GX-Life is not required to obtain governmental approval, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) approval, prior to selling its products to consumers, GX-Life’s products and related promotional and marketing activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation by numerous governmental agencies and authorities in the United States, including the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the United States Department of Agriculture, State Attorneys General, and other state regulatory agencies. In GX-Life’s foreign markets, the products are generally regulated by similar government agencies.
 
GX-Life’s personal care products are subject to various laws and regulations that regulate cosmetic products and set forth regulations for determining whether a product can be marketed as a “cosmetic” or requires further approval as an over-the-counter (“OTC”) drug. In the United States, regulation of cosmetics is under the jurisdiction of the FDA. The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics by their intended use, as “articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body . . . for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance.” Among the products included in this definition are skin moisturizers, eye and facial makeup preparations, perfumes, lipsticks, fingernail polishes, shampoos, permanent waves, hair colors, toothpastes and deodorants, as well as any material intended for use as a component of a cosmetic product. Conversely, a product will not be considered a cosmetic, but may be considered a drug if it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or is intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. A product’s intended use can be inferred from marketing or product claims. The other markets in which GX-Life operates have similar regulations.  In China, personal care products are placed into one of two categories, “general” and “drug.” Products in both categories require submission of formulas and other information with the health authorities, and drug products require human clinical studies. The product registration process in China for these products can take from nine to more than 18 months or longer.  Such regulations in any given market can limit GX-Life’s ability to import products and can delay product launches as GX-Life goes through the registration and approval process for those products.
 
The markets in which GX-Life operate all have varied regulations that distinguish foods and nutritional health supplements from “drugs” or “pharmaceutical products.” Because of the varied regulations, some products or ingredients that are recognized as a “food” in certain markets may be treated as a “pharmaceutical” in other markets. These regulations may require GX-Life to either modify a product or refrain from selling the product in a given market. As a result, GX-Life must regularly modify the ingredients and/or the levels of ingredients in its products for certain markets. In some circumstances, the regulations in foreign markets may require GX-Life to obtain regulatory approval prior to the introduction of a new product or limit GX-Life’s use of certain ingredients altogether. There has been an increased movement in the United States and other markets to expand the regulation of dietary supplements. This could impose additional restrictions or requirements in the future. Because of this increased regulatory focus, GX-Life’s internal review efforts have been enhanced in order to comply with its understanding of current regulations.
 
FDA regulations require current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) for dietary supplements. The regulations ensure that dietary supplements are produced in a quality manner, do not contain contaminants or impurities, and are accurately labeled. The regulations include requirements for establishing quality control procedures for GX-Life and its vendors and suppliers, designing and constructing manufacturing plants, and testing ingredients and finished products. The regulations also include requirements for record keeping and handling consumer product complaints. If dietary supplements contain contaminants or do not contain the type or quantity of dietary ingredient they are represented to contain, the FDA would consider those products to be adulterated or misbranded.
 
GX-Life’s business and products are subject to additional FDA regulations, such as those implementing an adverse event reporting system (“AER’s”), which requires GX-Life to document and track adverse events and report serious adverse events, which are events involving hospitalization or death, associated with consumers’ use of GX-Life’s products.
 
Most of GX-Life’s major markets also regulate advertising and product claims regarding the efficacy of products. This is particularly true with respect to GX-Life’s dietary supplements because GX-Life typically markets them as foods or health foods. For example, in the United States, GX-Life is unable to claim that any of its nutritional supplements will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent disease. In the United States, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, however, permits substantiated, truthful and non-misleading statements of nutritional support to be made in labeling, such as statements describing general well-being resulting from consumption of a dietary ingredient or the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in affecting or maintaining a structure or a function of the body. Most of the other markets in which GX-Life operates have not adopted similar legislation, although GX-Life may be subject to more restrictive limitations on the claims it can make about its products in these markets.

U.S. Federal Commodities Regulation
 
As a result of our strategic partnership with Great Coin and GX-Life's use of GX Coin as a component of the GX-Life Global Compensation Plan, it is possible that our Company and/or any one or more of our affiliates could be subject to regulation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”), depending on the CFTC’s views of the regulation of cryptocurrencies. In such event, the GX Coin Platform, which will be managed by Great Coin, may be required to be registered as a “swap execution facility”, as such term is defined by the Commodity Exchange Act, and we and/or one or more of our affiliates may be required to register with the CFTC.
 
Moreover, the CFTC retains enforcement authority over any contract or sale of any commodity in interstate commerce. Because the definition of "commodity" under the Commodity Exchange Act includes cryptocurrencies, the CFTC retains broad antifraud and anti-manipulation enforcement authority with respect to GX Coin transactions.
 
Except with respect to the CFTC's broad antifraud and anti-manipulation enforcement authority (discussed above), "spot" or "cash" contracts for commodities (including cryptocurrencies) are generally beyond the regulatory scope of the CFTC, so long as such contracts result in the immediate sale and delivery of the commodity. How the CFTC views what constitutes "actual delivery" in the context of cryptocurrencies is still a developing area of law and regulation. As a result, the CFTC's regulatory and enforcement authority and scope with respect to cryptocurrencies is still a moving target and subject to change as the market and the regulatory oversight landscape develops.
 
Money Transmitter Laws
 
As a result of GX-Life’s use of GX Coin in connection with the GX-Life Global Compensation Plan, our Company and/or any one or more of our affiliates may have to register with FinCEN as a money services business, as such term is defined under applicable FinCEN regulations, and obtain state money transmitter (or its equivalent) licenses, as required by the relevant state laws.
Other Regulatory Issues
 
As a United States entity selling in foreign jurisdictions, GX-Life and/or the Company is subject to foreign exchange control, transfer pricing, and custom laws that regulate the flow of funds between our subsidiaries and use for product purchases, management services and contractual obligations, such as the payment of member commissions. As is the case with most companies that operate in GX-Life’s product categories, GX-Life might receive inquiries from time to time from government regulatory authorities regarding the nature of its business and other issues, such as compliance with local direct selling, transfer pricing, customs, taxation, foreign exchange control, securities and other laws.
Effect of Governmental Regulations
 
GX-Life is subject to general business and governmental regulations and laws relating to its business and products. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede the products that GX-Life sells to its consumers. These regulations and laws may cover items such as: e-commerce, product labeling, product ingredients, pricing, distribution, reporting, consumer protections, and other similar regulations. Unfavorable outcomes of these issues may negatively impact the Company’s business and results of operations.
Product Warranties and Returns – Consumer Products
 
GX-Life's refund policies and procedures closely follow industry and country-specific standards, which vary greatly by country. For example, in the United States, the Direct Selling Association recommends that direct sellers permit returns during the twelve-month period following the sale, while in Hong Kong the standard return policy is 14 days following the sale. GX-Life's return policies typically conform to local laws or the recommendation of the local direct selling association. In most cases, GX-Life Members who timely return unopened product that is in resalable condition may receive a refund. The amount of the refund may be dependent on the country in which the sale occurred, the timeliness of the return, and any applicable re-stocking fee. However, GX-Life Members must notify GX-Life about any product returns in writing, and such returns may lead to the GX-Life Member’s termination or a reduction in the GX-Life Member’s commissions with GX-Life. Furthermore, GX-Life may alter its return policy in response to special circumstances from time to time.

Competition
 
We compete with many organizations including companies in the direct-selling and/or network marketing industry. These include very diverse companies, with giant multinational corporations as well as smaller, local operators competing amongst each other. Bigger companies include Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc., USANA Health Sciences, Inc., and Herbalife, Ltd, which have much greater name recognition and financial resources than GX-Life does and also have many more members. These companies are publicly traded. GX-Life faces significant competition from a wide variety of medium and small-sized privately held companies, many of whom compete directly with GX-Life. With the exception of GX-Life’s tea products, all cosmetic, nutrition, supplement, and energy drink products are made in the United States. GX-Life believes that the distribution of these “Made in USA” products gives it a competitive advantage over its peers that do not distribute such products because GX-Life believes that these products are in great demand in the Chinese, Taiwanese and Hong Kong markets. Furthermore, GX-Life believes that incorporating GX Coins into the GX-Life Global Compensation Plan gives GX-Life a competitive advantage because it differentiates and distinguishes GX-Life from other competing businesses that do not offer GX Coins or similar types of programs.
 
GX-Life's ability to compete with other companies depends, in significant part, on GX-Life's success in attracting customers to its products. There is no assurance that GX-Life will be able to compete effectively against retail stores, internet-based retailers, or other direct sellers, no matter which sales avenue is used.
 
EB-5 Operations
 
Acquisition of Global Future City Regional Center, LLC (f/k/a Powerdyne Regional Center, LLC)
 
On March 27, 2015, we closed on our acquisition of what became Global Future City Regional Center, LLC, an EB-5 Regional Center (USCIS ID Number 1215250671) that was approved by the USCIS on March 28, 2013. The closing (“Closing”) of the Membership PSA occurred on March 27, 2015. We intended on generating revenue in this line of business by collecting management fees for overseeing the development of a qualified investment project. We were never able to find an EB-5 investment project that met our internal criteria and, given the difficulties caused by Mr. Liu’s alleged actions, our investment in the Regional Center became significantly impaired. Consequently, we have abandoned this line of business and are pursuing a buyer for the Regional Center.
