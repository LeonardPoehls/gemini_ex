Company Mission and Strategy
 
ULURU Inc. (together with our subsidiaries, “We”, “ULURU” or the “Company”) is a Nevada corporation.
 
We are a specialty medical technology company committed to developing and commercializing a range of innovative wound care and muco-adhesive film products based on our patented Nanoflex® and OraDiscTM technologies, with the goal of improving outcomes for patients, health care professionals and payers.
 
Utilizing these two platform technologies, a number of products were developed of which one is being actively marketed in the wound care market. This product, Altrazeal® Transforming Powder Dressing (“Altrazeal®”), based on our Nanoflex® technology, has the potential to change the way health care providers approach wound treatment.   Altrazeal® is indicated for both exuding acute wounds such as partial thickness burns, donor sites, non-healing surgical wounds, and trauma and for chronic wounds such as venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, and pressure ulcers. Altrazeal® is registered for sale with the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the European Union (the “EU”) and a number of other international markets.
 
Our current strategy is to primarily focus on the commercialization of Altrazeal® and to establish a market leadership position in wound management by developing and commercializing a customer focused portfolio of innovative wound care products.  We will also evaluate the potential for commercialization of the other products as well as explore strategic collaborations to further develop our oral mucoadhesive film technology (OraDiscTM) for systemic drug delivery and for delivery of actives to the oral cavity.
 
We will also continue to execute a series of operational plans launched in 2015 to enhance and streamline our business. We are restructuring our operations to improve efficiency and reduce cost, including production, distribution, and administration costs. We are also undertaking efforts to stimulate sales, enhance marketing, and expedite regulatory approvals for new market entry of Altrazeal®.

Core Technology Platforms
 
Nanoflex® Technology
 
The Nanoflex® technology platform provides the ability to formulate a variety of unique materials through the aggregation of hydrogel-like particles. This concept takes advantage of the inherent biocompatibility of hydrogels. Unlike bulk hydrogels, these aggregates are shape retentive, can be extruded or molded, and offer properties suitable for use in a variety of in-vivo medical devices, and in novel drug delivery systems. The polymers used in our Nanoflex® technology have been extensively researched and commercialized into several major medical products including contact lenses and other FDA-approved implants.  They are generally accepted as safe, non-toxic and biocompatible.
 
Utilizing our proprietary Nanoflex® technology, we have developed a Nanoflex® Powder platform. Our Nanoflex® Powder is a novel wound treatment technology used to promote the healing of exuding wounds.  We believe that the scientifically engineered material has qualities not available in other dressings currently available in terms of properties and performance, and can be used in chronic, acute, surgical and traumatic wounds.  It is formulated as a two-polymer blend in a specific ratio.  In the presence of wound exudate, the particles hydrate and irreversibly aggregate to conform to the contours of the wound bed, transforming into a moist, flexible, moisture-permeable film. This film not only provides an optimal moist wound environment which supports cellular function and tissue repair, but it is also of appropriate pore size to prevent intrusion by exogenous bacteria.  After application to the wound bed, Nanoflex® Powder exhibits mechanical properties which are similar to soft tissue.  The stable, non-resorbable film flakes off at the edges as the wound heals, like a scab. It can remain in place for an extended period as compared to other dressings if exudate is present and can be removed without additional trauma, leaving no residue in the wound bed.  Nanoflex® Powder can also serve as a drug delivery matrix for antiseptics, and there is potential for its use as a delivery platform for anti-inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids, pro-angiogenic agents, and other actives such as growth factors to accelerate wound healing.
 
Mucoadhesive OraDiscTM Technology
 
Treatment of oral conditions generally relies upon the use of medications formulated as gels and pastes, which are applied to lesions in the mouth. The duration of effectiveness of these medications is typically short because the applied dose is worn away through the mechanical actions of speaking, eating, and tongue movement, and is washed away by saliva flow. To address these problems, we developed a novel erodible mucoadhesive film product. This technology, known as OraDisc™, comprises a multi-layered film having an adhesive layer, a pre-formed film layer, and a coated backing layer. Depending upon the intended application, a pharmaceutically active compound can be formulated within any of these layers, providing a wide range of potential applications. The disc stays in place eroding over a period of time, so that subsequent removal is unnecessary. The drug delivery rate may be adjusted by altering the rate of erosion of the disc, which is in turn controlled by the composition of the backing layer.
 
Our adhesive film technology has the potential for multiple applications, including the localized delivery of drug to a mucosal site, use as a transmucosal delivery device for delivering drugs into the systemic circulation, and incorporating the drug in the outer layer for delivery into the oral cavity. The adhesive film will adhere to any wet mucosal surface. Additionally, the adhesive film has been formulated to adhere to the surface of teeth and gums for the delivery of dental health and cosmetic dental actives. Initial drug delivery studies using our adhesive film technology indicate the potential to achieve significantly higher drug exposure and higher blood level concentrations.
 
OraDisc™ A was initially developed as a drug delivery system to treat canker sores using amlexanox as the active ingredient, which is the same active ingredient that was used in our Aphthasol® paste which was also developed for the treatment of canker sores, but has not been commercialized.
 
OraDisc™ B was developed for the treatment of oral pain using 15 mg of Benzocaine, the maximum allowable strength that falls under the classification of an OTC monograph product in the United States.
 
Although we are not currently marketing or selling OraDisc™ A or OraDisc™ B, we intend to explore the viability of commercializing these products in the future through strategic collaborations.

Marketed Products
 
We are currently focusing our resources and efforts primarily on the marketing of Altrazeal®:
 
Altrazeal®
 
Altrazeal® Transforming Powder Dressing, based on our Nanoflex® technology, has the potential to change the way health care providers approach the treatment of wounds.  The product is indicated for exuding wounds such as partial thickness burns, donor sites, abrasions, non-healing surgical wounds, trauma and chronic wounds including diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers. The powder is used to fill and seal the wound to provide an optimal moist wound healing environment. The wound exudate is controlled through the high moisture vapor transpiration rate (“MVTR”) of the material.  Intimate contact at the wound bed supports cellular function and tissue repair. Other characteristics of Altrazeal® that promote healing are oxygen permeability and bacteria impermeability.  Patient comfort is enhanced with the easy application and removal of our wound dressing, where granulating tissue is not harmed during the removal procedure.  In a randomized clinical study, Altrazeal® demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in patient pain and comfort compared to Aquacel®, a market leading product, in the treatment of skin graft donor sites.  Also, in numerous clinical settings, including venous leg ulcers, arterial ulcers and second degree burns, significant pain reduction has been reported by patients, enabling increased compliance to therapy and improved clinical outcomes.  The dressing is flexible and adherent and is designed to allow greater range of motion. In addition, the ability of Altrazeal® to manage wound exudates extends the wear time between dressing changes, which offers a significant pharmaco-economic benefit.  This feature is considered an extremely important marketing advantage in countries where there are socialized medical programs.
 
Altrazeal® is a 510(k) exempt product and has been registered with the FDA. It has also been granted registrations in a number of international markets, including a CE Mark Certification which enables us to market in all European Union member states and other countries that recognize the CE Mark.
 
Since the roll-out of Altrazeal®, numerous positive clinical experiences have been documented. The focus of our commercial activities is to introduce Altrazeal® globally both directly and through our network of distribution partners. Due to the efforts of our current and former distribution partners, Altrazeal® has contractual partners in many of the major international territories.
 
As part of the Company’s current turn-around plan, we will continue to evaluate all of our distribution relationships to ensure that they meet the criteria for advancing the Company’s current business plan. We are also starting to evaluate potential launch strategies for the U.S. market.
 
Patents
 
We believe that the value of technology both to us and to our potential corporate partners is established and enhanced by our intellectual property positions. Consequently, we have already been issued and seek to obtain additional U.S. and foreign patents for products under development and for new discoveries. Patent applications are filed for our inventions and prospective products with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and, when appropriate, with authorities in countries that are a part of the Paris Convention’s Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) (most major countries in Western Europe and the Far East) and with other authorities in major markets not covered by the PCT.  However, due to our previous liquidity situation, certain of our patents and patent applications may have lapsed.
 
With regards to our Nanoflex® technology, three patents have issued in the U.S. and multiple patents have been issued in international countries.  There are also four PCT patent applications that have been filed and nine patent applications filed in nine international countries. The granted patents and patent applications have a variety of potential applications, such as wound management, burn care, dermal fillers, artificial discs and tissue scaffold.
 
We have one U.S. patent and have filed one PCT patent application for our OraDisc™ technology. This oral delivery vehicle potentially overcomes the difficulties encountered in using conventional paste and gel formulations for conditions in the mouth. Utilizing this technology, we anticipate that higher drug concentrations will be achieved at the disease site, increasing the effectiveness of the product.  Our patent applications cover the delivery of drugs through or into any mucosal surface. The patent and patent applications cover our ability to control the erosion time of the adhesive film and the subsequent drug release by adjusting the ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic polymers in the outer layer of the composite film.
 
The United States patents for our technologies and products expire in the years indicated below:

Manufacturing and Supply
 
We currently rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers, monitored by our internal management, to manufacture, package, and finish our products and do not currently have relationships with alternate suppliers. We are currently in the process of re-evaluating all of our contract manufacturers for efficiency, regulatory compliance, and cost-effectiveness.  We believe that there are other contract manufacturers that can satisfy our production requirements, but should it be necessary to change suppliers this could result in a delay while they are qualified and validated.
Marketing and Distribution
 
We do not currently have the resources to market and distribute our products directly through an in-house sales force and distribution network.  As a result, we have entered into agreements to market and distribute our products through distributors.
 
Revenues per geographic area, along with relative percentages of total revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are described in greater detail in Note 4 of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
 
Significant Customers
 
A significant portion of our revenues are derived from a few major customers.  In the year 2016, three customers had greater than 10% of total revenues and jointly represented 88% of total revenues.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, two customers had greater than 10% of total revenues and jointly represented 76% of total revenues.
Research and Development, Quality Management, and Regulatory Affairs
 
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we expended approximately $445,000 and $764,000, respectively in research and development, regulatory affairs and quality management activities.  The costs incurred for each of the two years are primarily attributable to maintaining our quality management system and with registration of Altrazeal® in new territories.
Government Regulation
 
The Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In the U.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the FDA continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S.
 
The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused on drug and device prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally.
 
The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product approvals, withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls.
 
In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.
 
Further, the Company relies on global supply and distribution processes that are subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may affect the Company's products and are also subject to lengthy regulatory approvals.

Competition
 
The industry that we compete in is characterized by intense competition, rapid product development and technological change.  Competition in the industry is generally based upon quality, efficacy, price, accessibility and service.  Competition is intense among manufacturers of prescription pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and other product areas where we may develop and market products in the future.  Most of our potential competitors in the wound care market such as Smith & Nephew plc, Systagenix Wound Management Limited, ConvaTec Inc., 3M Company, and Molnlycke Health Care are large, well established medical device or healthcare companies with considerably greater financial, marketing, sales and technical resources than are available to us. Additionally, many of our potential competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow such competitors to develop new or improved products that may compete with our product lines.  Our potential products could be rendered obsolete or made uneconomical by the development of new products to treat the conditions to be addressed by our developments, technological advances affecting the cost of production, or marketing or pricing actions by one or more of our potential competitors.  Our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected by any one or more of such developments.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competition will not have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We are aware of certain developmental projects for products to treat or prevent certain diseases targeted by us.  The existence of these potential products or other products or treatments of which we are not aware, or products or treatments that may be developed in the future, may adversely affect the marketability of products developed by us.
 
In the area of wound management, which are the focus of our development activities, a number of companies are developing or evaluating new technology approaches.  We expect that technological developments will occur at a rapid rate and that competition is likely to intensify as various alternative technologies achieve similar, if not identical or superior, advantages.
 
Wound care products developed from our Nanoflex® technology, including Altrazeal®, will compete with numerous well established products including Aquacel® marketed by ConvaTec Inc., Promongran® marketed by Systagenix Wound Management Limited, Acticoat® and Allevyn® marketed by Smith and Nephew plc, and Mepitel® and Mepliex® marketing by Molnlycke Health Care.
 
Any products developed from OraDisc™ erodible film technology, for the controlled release of pharmaceutical actives, will compete with numerous alternative drug delivery technologies including fast release film technology, transdermal drug delivery, and other mucoadhesive film technologies.
 
Even if our products are fully developed and receive the required regulatory approval, of which there can be no assurance, we believe that our products require extensive sales efforts directed both at the medical professional and the consumer and can only compete successfully if marketed by companies with relevant expertise.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had two full-time employees, including one in general and administration and one in manufacturing and quality.  In addition, we use contract consultants for business development, quality control and quality assurance, clinical administration, regulatory affairs, and office administration.  Our employees are not represented by a labor union and are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  At times, we may compliment our internal expertise with external scientific consultants, university research laboratories and contract manufacturing organizations that specialize in various aspects of drug development including clinical development, regulatory affairs, toxicology, preclinical testing and process scale-up.
