 Item 1. Business.
 ﻿
 General
 We are a leading owner and operator of high-quality, individually branded ski resorts in the U.S.  We currently operate 14 ski resorts primarily located in the Northeast and Midwest, 13 of which we own. The majority of our resorts are located within 100 miles of major metropolitan markets, including New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland and St. Louis, enabling day and overnight drive accessibility. Our resorts are comprised of nearly 1,860 acres of skiable terrain that appeal to a wide range of ages and abilities. We offer a breadth of activities, services and amenities, including skiing, snowboarding, terrain parks, tubing, dining, lodging, equipment rentals and sales, ski and snowboard instruction and mountain biking, zip tours and other summer activities. We believe that both the day and overnight drive segments of the ski industry are appealing given their stable revenue base, high margins and attractive risk-adjusted returns. We have successfully acquired and integrated 11 ski resorts since our incorporation in 1997, and we expect to continue executing this strategy.
 ﻿
 We have built an award-winning portfolio of individually branded entertainment properties, most of which are recognized as leading ski resorts in their respective markets. Our devotion to maintaining high quality standards across our portfolio through strategic investments and upgrades has created a loyal customer base that contributes to a significant number of repeat visits at each of our resorts. In particular, our investment over the last decade in the latest high-efficiency snowmaking equipment has earned us the reputation as an industry leader in snowmaking efficiency, capacity and quality. Our strong branding reinforces customer loyalty and serves to attract new visitors through focused marketing campaigns and word of mouth.
 ﻿
 Combined, our resorts generated approximately 1.8 million ski and tubing visits in the 2017/2018 ski season.  Despite volatile weather conditions during the 2017/2018 ski season, we recorded record revenue of $131.7 million for fiscal 2018, an increase of 6.8% over fiscal 2017.  Revenue for fiscal 2018 was up from the prior year due to growth in visits and season pass sales. As the U.S. economy continues to improve, our resorts are well-positioned to benefit from increased consumer spending on leisure activities, and we expect to continue to increase our lift ticket prices and drive more skier visits to our resorts.
 The U.S. ski industry is highly fragmented, with less than 15% of the 479 ski resorts being owned by companies with four or more ski resorts. We believe our proven ability to efficiently operate multiple resorts as well as our track record of successful acquisitions has created our reputation in the marketplace as a preferred buyer. We believe extensive experience in acquiring ski resorts and investing in snowmaking, lifts and other skier services, as well as the synergies we create by operating multiple resorts, drives increased revenues and profitability. Our capabilities serve as a competitive advantage in sourcing and executing investment opportunities as sellers will often provide us a "first look" at opportunities outside of a broader marketing process, allowing us to expand both within our existing markets and into new markets.
 We operate in a single business segment—resort operations. We are not dependent on any single customer, the loss of which would have a material impact on our financial statements, and we derive no revenue from foreign sources.
 Our History
 Peak Resorts, Inc. was incorporated in Missouri on September 24, 1997, as a holding company to own or lease and operate day and overnight drive ski resorts through its wholly owned subsidiaries. Throughout the history of the Company, including the development of the Hidden Valley and Snow Creek ski resorts before the incorporation of Peak Resorts, Inc., the Company has acquired or developed a total of 14 ski resorts.
 On November 20, 2014, we completed our initial public offering of our common stock, selling 10 million shares at $9.00 per share. After deducting $6.3 million of underwriting discounts and commissions and $1.4 million of offering expenses payable by us, we received net proceeds of $82.3 million. Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “SKIS”.
 On January 6, 2016, we completed the acquisition of the Hunter Mountain ski resort located in Hunter, New York, through the purchase of all of the outstanding stock of each of Hunter Mountain Ski Bowl, Inc., Hunter Mountain Festivals, Ltd., Hunter Mountain Rentals, Inc., Hunter Resort Vacations, Inc., Hunter Mountain Base Lodge, Inc., and Frosty Land, Inc. (collectively, “Hunter Mountain”). The Company acquired Hunter Mountain for total cash consideration of $35.0 million plus the assumption of two capital leases estimated at approximately $1.7 million. 
 On November 2, 2016, we completed a private placement (the “Private Placement”) of securities to CAP 1 LLC (the “Investor”). The securities issued in the Private Placement included $20 million in Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) and warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase up to 2,719,018 shares of our

common stock at prices ranging from $6.50 per share to $9.00 per share. In connection with the Private Placement, we entered into a Stockholders’ Agreement granting the Investor the right to nominate a director to sit on the Company’s board of directors, preemptive rights with respect to certain future issuances of securities, and consent rights regarding certain acquisitions and dispositions, in each case subject to stock ownership requirements and exceptions. The terms of the Private Placement, Series A Preferred Stock and the Warrants are more fully described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
 Our Resorts 
 Our 14 ski resorts consist of six overnight drive ski resorts and eight-day ski resorts located across seven states, ranging from Missouri to New Hampshire, and appeal to a wide range of visitors. All of our ski resorts employ high-capacity snowmaking capabilities on over 90% of their terrain as well as food and beverage, equipment rental and retail outlets. All of our properties offer alternative snow activities, such as terrain parks and tubing, in addition to skiing and snowboarding. The diversity of our services and amenities allows us to capture a larger proportion of customer spending as well as ensure product and service quality at our resorts. 
 During the 2016/2017 ski season, the Company introduced the Peak Pass, a season pass which features a total of six pass options valid at seven different mountain locations across four states in the Northeast. Participating resorts include Mount Snow in Vermont; Attitash, Wildcat and Crotched Mountains in New Hampshire; Hunter Mountain in New York; and Jack Frost and Big Boulder in Pennsylvania.  The Company believes the variety of each resort's on-mountain experience, as well as the proximity of these resorts, makes the Peak Pass a unique and affordable product for the vast majority of skiers and riders in the Northeastern U.S.
 For the 2018/2019 ski season we introduced the Ohio Peak Pass add-on, which will allow season pass holders from our individual Ohio resorts to enjoy skiing at our existing Peak Pass resorts.
 The following table summarizes key statistics relating to each of our resorts as of April 30, 2018:

Capital Projects    As part of our mission to build value by investing in our current properties through expansions, new products and amenities that will elevate our customers’ skiing and off-season experiences, during fiscal 2018 we completed one major project and continued to move forward with capital improvement projects at our Hunter Mountain, Hidden Valley and Mount Snow resorts. 

· | At Hunter Mountain, we began the Hunter North expansion project to increase the resort’s skiable acreage by approximately 25%, add automated snowmaking and a six-passenger detachable high-speed chair lift and a parking area. We expect to complete the project during the 2018/2019 ski season. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | At Mount Snow, we completed construction on the West Lake Water project in November 2017, and immediately began using this new snowmaking infrastructure as we opened the resort for the 2017/2018 ski season. The West Lake Water project included i) construction of a new water storage reservoir for snowmaking with capacity of up to 120 million gallons, ii) construction of three new pump houses, iii) installation of snowmaking pipelines, and iv) other related improvements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | At Mount Snow, we continued construction on the Carinthia Ski Lodge project. The Carinthia Ski Lodge project includes the construction of a new ski lodge at the resort’s Carinthia base, comprised of a three-story, 36,000-square foot skier service building which will include i) a restaurant, cafeteria and bars with seating for over 600 people, ii) retail facilities, and iii) a sales center for lift tickets and equipment rentals. We expect to complete the Carinthia Ski Lodge project prior to the 2018/2019 ski season.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | At Hidden Valley, we obtained government approval to construct a zip line tour which we anticipate will generate additional sales and diversify that resort’s revenue base. We anticipate completing the project during calendar year 2019.

 Ski Industry           The National Ski Areas Association (“NSAA”) Kottke National End of Season Survey - Preliminary Report (the “Kottke Report”) estimated the U.S. ski industry had approximately 53.3 million skier visits in the 2017/2018 ski season, down 1.5 million or 2.8%, from the 2016/2017 ski season.  The Kottke Report also reported that there were 472 ski areas operating during the 2017/2018 ski season in the U.S., down nine areas from the 2017/2018 ski season.  Given the consistency and strength of annual skier visits over the last 30 years, as well as the state of the recovering economy, we believe that skier participation will remain strong in the coming years.    The ski industry divides ski resorts into three distinct categories: overnight fly, overnight drive and day ski resorts. Overnight fly ski resorts are defined as ski resorts which primarily serve skiers who fly or drive considerable distances and stay for multiple nights. These resorts depend, in large part, on long-distance travel by their visitors and on the development of adjacent real estate for housing, hospitality and retail uses. Overnight drive ski resorts are ski resorts which primarily serve skiers from the regional drive market who stay overnight. Day ski resorts are typically located within 50 miles of a major metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) and do not generally offer dedicated lodging. 
 Day and overnight drive ski resorts tend to be smaller in size and are usually located near metropolitan areas. As an owner and operator of primarily day and overnight drive ski resorts, we focus on selling lift tickets, renting ski equipment, selling ski lessons, offering food and beverage services and catering to the targeted local market. We target skiers of all levels from beginners who are skiing for the first time to intermediate and advanced skiers who are honing their skills. 
 An important statistic used to gauge the performance of companies operating within the ski industry is revenue per skier visit. The revenue per skier visit of our resorts for the 2007/2008 ski season (the first season subsequent to the Mount Snow and Attitash acquisitions) to the 2016/2017 ski season (the most current ski season for which data is available) increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 4.7% compared to an increase of 4.0% for the U.S. ski industry for the same period. Revenue per skier visit is calculated as total resort revenue divided by skier visits.

 ﻿

· | Lift and Tubing Tickets— Lift tickets are our most important source of operating revenues. We place heavy emphasis on sales of season passes and advance group ticket sales to schools, religious organizations and other social groups at a discount. We market our season passes and advance group ticket sales to our ski visitors and the communities we serve. The cost of lift tickets at each of our resorts varies according to geographic region, session time and day of the week.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Food and Beverage—Our facilities generally employ cafeteria-style and self-service options to provide a limited menu of simple foods, liquor, beer and wine. We try to maximize revenues and simplify operations by focusing on a limited menu that requires minimal special preparation and related personnel costs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Equipment Rental— Day ski resorts generally attain a higher percentage of rental revenue than overnight fly destination ski resorts and overnight drive ski resorts because a large majority of day ski resort skiers are novices, who typically do not own ski equipment. Equipment rental rates generally range between $30 and $45 per person per session. We have focused on improving our equipment rental facilities to provide quick access to new and high-quality equipment, self-service options with expert advice and fitting available, and immediate access to the lifts and ski instruction areas from the rental facility. By eliminating the equipment rental bottleneck, we believe we have significantly enhanced the skiers' resort experience, which corresponds to increased rental revenues.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ski Instruction— Ski instruction is considered important to operations because of the large numbers of novice or early intermediate skiers who typically visit day ski resorts. We offer low group lesson prices to encourage participation, which range from $15 and $49 per person per lesson. Individual instructions and private lessons may range from $45 to $130 or more per lesson.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Hotel/Lodging— Because we primarily operate day ski resorts, not all of our resorts offer hotel or other lodging services. We derive revenue from room rentals, and the operation of retail, restaurant, conference, spa and health club facilities. At condominium properties we operate under rental management agreements, we also derive revenue from housekeeping and other services provided to individual unit owners.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  During fiscal 2018, we operated hotels at our Attitash, Hunter Mountain and Mount Snow ski resorts, where third parties own 100% of all available quarter-share interval interests, and we retain ownership of common areas and commercial space of the hotel. At Mount Snow, we manage other condominium properties from which we derive rental and property management fees, and we own and operate the Snow Lake Lodge, a traditional hotel property. As of the end of fiscal 2018, we ceased operation of the rental management program, restaurant and certain hotel-like amenities at a condominium building adjacent to our Attitash resort.

· | Retail— Like ski instruction services, retail also represents a relatively small percentage of our total revenues. Some of our resorts offer a selection of more substantial ski-related equipment, such as boots, skis and snowsuits, while others maintain only a minimal selection of smaller items, such as gloves and goggles. Merchandise selection and pricing decisions are made in light of consumer trends and local demographic conditions. To an extent we have centralized our retail purchasing function, however individual ski resort management personnel oversee their merchandise selection as they see fit for their markets. At certain resorts we lease merchandise operations to third-party merchants.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Summer Activities— Although the majority of our resorts do not have material operations during the summer months, we do operate several resorts during the summer. Activities include zip tours, water parks, mountain coasters, horseback riding, conferences, camps, and festivals. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Seasonality
 ﻿
 Our revenues are highly seasonal in nature. The vast majority of revenue is generated during the ski season, which occurs during the winter months in our third and fourth fiscal quarters.  Some of our properties offer off season attractions, such as golf, roller coasters, swimming, summer concerts and zip rides; however, these activities do not comprise a substantial portion of our annual revenues.   As a result, our resorts typically experience operating losses and negative operating cash flows during the first and second quarters of each fiscal year.
 The seasonality of our revenues amplifies the effect of events outside our control, especially weather. While our geographically diverse operating locations help mitigate the effect of weather conditions, adverse weather could lower attendance due to suboptimal skiing conditions or limited access to our resorts, render snowmaking wholly or partially ineffective in maintaining ski conditions, and increase operating costs related to snowmaking efforts and inefficient labor utilization.
 The opening and closing dates of our ski resorts are dependent upon weather conditions, but our peak ski season generally runs from early December to mid-April.  The following table illustrates the opening and closing dates of our resorts over the last five ski seasons:

 ﻿
 Marketing
 We promote our resorts through both on-site marketing and external marketing. We encourage visitors to return to our resorts by offering complimentary skier orientations at our resorts. We also have marketing programs in place directed at attracting groups, such as religious organizations, social clubs, corporate entities, schools and civic organizations, and we offer discounts to active military personnel. We believe that group discounts encourage new participants to try snow sports. 

 
9


Student passes are also sold through schools, and season passes are promoted through targeted direct mail marketing, the internet and local sporting goods stores.
 Our resorts attempt to maximize community awareness through social media, radio advertisements, special events and promotions and “free media” advertising, when possible. We host competitions and charity events, issue media passes and encourage live radio and television broadcasts for news segments such as weather or sports. Events we have hosted include the Dew Tour, X-Games, Tough Mudder, SAM Cutters Camp, Transworld Trans-am Snowboard Event, Mountain Dew Vertical Challenge, NCAA National Downhill Championships, Special Olympics Games, Military Salutes, Taste of Country Music Festival, and U.S. National Mountain Biking Championships.
 Competition    We believe there are high barriers to entry for new ski resorts due to i) the limited private lands on which ski resorts can be developed, ii) the difficulty in getting necessary government approvals and permits to build on public land and iii) the substantial capital resources needed to construct necessary ski infrastructure. As such, we believe the risk that our market will become saturated with new industry participants is relatively low. We believe our resorts do not directly compete with overnight fly destination ski resorts, such as the larger ski resorts in Colorado, California, Nevada, Utah and other destination ski resorts worldwide. Rather, we believe we compete primarily with other existing day and overnight drive ski resorts and non-ski related day vacations.     Our competition varies by geographical area. While we believe our Midwestern market ski resorts face only limited competition within their relative metropolitan markets, there are many other day and overnight drive ski resorts which compete with our Northeastern and Southeastern market ski resorts. We compete with approximately 146 resorts in the Northeastern market and 47 resorts in the Southeastern market, which includes Pennsylvania.    Competitive Strengths 
 We believe our strengths are as follows: 
 We own a high-quality branded portfolio.  We own 13 and operate 14 high-quality ski resorts, each of which is individually branded and recognized to be a leading ski resort in its respective regional market. Our devotion to maintaining high quality standards through strategic investments and upgrades has created a loyal customer base at each of our resorts. Our strong branding reinforces customer loyalty and serves to attract new guests through focused marketing campaigns and word of mouth. 
 ﻿
 We have a history of investing in targeted capital projects to increase profitability.  We are continuously evaluating our property-level performance and are committed to increasing our profitability. Many ski resort operators are unwilling to invest in improvements due to capital constraints and the perceived risk of such investments. Over our history, we have made significant investments throughout our portfolio of resorts in an effort to improve the profitability of our ski resorts through energy-efficient snowmaking machinery, high-speed/high-capacity lifts and additional features such as terrain parks, zip tours, and various other infrastructure investments. The costs of these improvements are significantly outweighed by the benefits realized, which include higher quality and less costly snow, shorter lift lines, terrain expansion, off season revenue builders and customer appreciation. We have found that our ability to transport customers up the mountain on high-speed chairlifts and otherwise reduce lift lines attracts skiers, promotes a better skiing experience, and leads to higher restaurant and retail sales and increased customer satisfaction. Our most recent expansive capital projects that were completed in fiscal 2018 or in process as of April 30, 2018, include snow making infrastructure and a new ski lodge at our Mount Snow ski resort in Vermont and terrain expansion and a new lift at our Hunter Mountain ski resort in New York.
     We are an experienced and successful acquirer and integrator.  We have grown our Company significantly since inception by acquiring strategically located ski resorts with the potential for increased revenue growth and margin expansion. We have successfully acquired and integrated 11 ski resorts since 1997. We adhere to a disciplined acquisition strategy by pursuing opportunities at attractive acquisition prices that can create additional value through operational improvements and efficiencies. After acquiring a ski resort, we implement a strategic repositioning program designed during the underwriting process and integrate the resort into our portfolio. We believe our track record for acquiring and integrating ski resorts makes us an industry leader and gives us a competitive advantage over other buyers.

Our experienced senior management team is dedicated to providing a reliable and enjoyable ski experience.    Our senior executive team has over 60 years of combined experience owning, operating and acquiring ski resorts in the United States. Since 1982, it has been our vision to offer a reliable and enjoyable skiing experience to our customers. As a result of this vision, our management team constantly strives to enhance and improve our snowmaking capabilities to ensure our ski resorts maintain high-quality snow throughout the season. In addition, our management team strives to provide our ski resorts with a full range of amenities to augment our customers' overall skiing experience. 
 ﻿
 Overnight drive and day ski resorts experience lower sensitivity to the economy.  We believe our portfolio of resorts provides a more attractive risk-adjusted return than overnight fly resorts due to the stability in our visits. Furthermore, we believe customers are more likely to visit overnight drive and day ski resorts during an economic downturn as compared to other higher cost overnight fly ski resorts, resulting in less sensitivity to downturns in the economy. Our revenue per skier visit increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 4.7% from the 2007/2008 ski season to the 2016/2017 ski season compared to an increase of 4.0% for the U.S. ski industry for the same period.
     The ski industry possesses high barriers to entry.  A limited number of ski resorts have been developed in the past 30 years. Skiable land is scarce and demanding to develop due to the difficulty in aggregating suitable terrain, obtaining government permitting, resolving accessibility issues and addressing heightened environmental concerns. Operating a ski resort requires a high level of expertise and strict regulatory and environmental compliance. Additionally, many resorts have built significant customer loyalty and brand awareness over multiple generations, which can be difficult for a new entrant to overcome. These factors have contributed to the number of ski resorts decreasing 35.8%, from 735 in 1984 to 472 in 2018 as smaller, poorly capitalized resorts have been unable to compete effectively. With our large existing portfolio, proven capital investment strategy and strong customer loyalty, we believe our portfolio of resorts is competitively well-positioned. 
 ﻿
 Our ski resort portfolio is diverse.  Our portfolio of 14 ski resorts consists of six overnight drive ski resorts and eight day ski resorts located across seven states ranging from Missouri to New Hampshire. We believe our portfolio mix enables us to reach a large customer base seeking high-quality ski resorts within driving distance of major metropolitan areas. Each of our ski resorts is located within reasonable drive times from major metropolitan areas such as New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland and St. Louis, which we believe provides us with a consistent repeat customer base and increases our new customer outreach potential. We believe that the size and geographic diversity of our portfolio helps insulate our financial performance against adverse economic and weather conditions.
     We are a proven operator of ski resorts.  We have operated numerous ski resorts since our incorporation in 1997. Due to our extensive operating expertise, we believe we have a profitable and efficient platform that positions us to take advantage of growth initiatives and cost controls. 
 ﻿
 Management’s and stockholders’ interests are aligned.  Our management team owns approximately 16% of our outstanding shares. We believe this substantial ownership by management aligns our interests with those of our stockholders. 
 Intellectual Property
 We understand the importance to the sales and marketing of our resorts that a strong brand can maintain. Wildcat Mountain Ski AreaSM, Mount Snow®, Boston Mills Ski ResortSM, Hidden ValleySM, Crotched Mountain Ski AreaSM ,  Alpine Valley and Hunter MountainSM are trademarks, service marks and trade names owned by certain subsidiaries of Peak Resorts, Inc.   Regulation and Legislation 
 The 1986 Ski Area Permit Act and Master Development Plans 
 The 1986 Ski Area Permit Act (the "1986 Act") allows the National Forest Service to grant special use permits for the operation of ski resorts and construction of related facilities on National Forest lands. In addition, the permits granted to our ski resorts under the 1986 Act require a master development plan for each ski resort that is granted a special use permit. Of our 14 resorts, only Wildcat Mountain and portions of Attitash and Mount Snow operate under special use permits under the

1986 Act. The skiable terrain at our other resorts is located on land that we own or lease from third parties, including state governments. 
 Each area of National Forest land maintains a land and resource management plan, which establishes standards and guidelines for the Forest Service to follow and consider in reviewing and approving proposed uses. Under the 1986 Act, the Forest Service has the right to review and approve the locations, design and construction of improvements in the permit area and many other operational matters. 
 Our special use permits expire as follows: Attitash ski resort—April 4, 2047; Mount Snow ski resort—April 4, 2047; and Wildcat Mountain ski resort—November 18, 2050. We intend to request new special use permits for each of these resorts as provided by the Forest Service regulations and terms of the existing special use permits. To our knowledge, the Forest Service has never refused to issue a new special use permit to replace an expiring special use permit for an operating ski resort. 
 Special use permits contain requirements and impose obligations on our part, including that we indemnify the Forest Service from third-party claims arising out of our operations under the special use permits and that we comply with all applicable laws. We are required to pay an annual fee to the Forest Service for special use permits which could range from 1.5% to 4.0% of revenue from sales and services provided on Forest Service land. Historically we have paid fees ranging from 1.5% to 2.5% of such revenue and do not expect that this will change in the near future. The calculation of the fee is based on sales from lift tickets, season passes, ski instruction, food, beverages and merchandise, as well as equipment rental fees, and other ancillary services. 
 Special use permits may be amended by mutual agreement between us and the Forest Service to change the applicable ski resort or permitted uses. The Forest Service may also modify special use permits to accommodate changes in plans or operations. Permit amendments must be consistent with the land and resource management plan and are subject to the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"). 
 The Forest Service may terminate a special use permit if it determines that termination is required for specific compelling reasons. However, to our knowledge, no special use permit for a ski resort has ever been terminated by the Forest Service without the consent of the operator. 
 We must propose a master development plan for all improvements we intend to make on National Forest lands and submit such plans to the Forest Service for review and acceptance. Once the Forest Service accepts a master development plan, individual projects contemplated by the plan are approved by the Forest Service through separate applications.
 National Environmental Policy Act 
 Under NEPA, our major proposed actions on all National Forest land, such as the expansion of a ski resort or installation of new snowmaking equipment, must be assessed to determine the environmental impacts of such actions. Upon our application to the Forest Service to undertake major projects, the Forest Service must conduct an environmental study, which can impact the time it takes to complete a project. During these studies, the Forest Service is required to consider alternatives to proposed actions and impacts that may be unavoidable. We may not get the Forest Service's approval to undertake a project or may be required to take alternative action, depending on the results of the environmental studies.  Underground Storage Tank Regulations 
 We have underground storage tanks ("USTs") on our ski resort properties in Ohio, New Hampshire, New York Pennsylvania and Vermont for the purpose of storing gasoline, fuel oil and propane that we use in the operation of our resorts, lodges and skier service buildings. The federal Solid Waste Disposal Act gives the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") the authority to regulate USTs. State UST programs which are at least as strict as the federal regulations and which have been approved by the EPA, govern the USTs in lieu of the federal regulations. The objectives of the state UST programs are to ensure that:
" | USTs are properly constructed and designed in accordance with recognized industry standards;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


" | Installations, repairs and removals are conducted and inspected by qualified and trained individuals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


" | Active USTs are properly operated and monitored for the release of substances; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

" | Upon closure, USTs are properly decommissioned and sites are assessed for contamination.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We believe that the USTs at our facilities meet all state and federal construction and operation standards. Compliance with these UST regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, and we do not expect it to have a material impact in the future. 
 Employees    As of April 30, 2018, our Company employed 481 year-round full-time employees and 165 year-round part-time employees.  In addition, during the height of our 2017/2018 ski season, we employed approximately 5,838 seasonal employees.
