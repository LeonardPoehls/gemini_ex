Overview
Hi-Crush Partners LP (together with its subsidiaries, the "Partnership") is a premier provider of proppant and logistics solutions to the North American energy industry. Our portfolio of production facilities is capable of producing 13.4 million tons per year of high-quality monocrystalline sand, a specialized mineral used as a proppant during the well completion process, necessary to facilitate the recovery of hydrocarbons from oil and natural gas wells. Our Wisconsin production facilities' direct access to major U.S. railroads and our strategically located owned and operated in-basin terminals as well as our Texas production facility positions us within close proximity to significant activity in all major oil and gas basins. Our integrated distribution system, including our PropStreamTM logistics service, delivers proppant the "last mile" into the blender.
Over the past decade, exploration and production companies have focused on exploiting the vast hydrocarbon reserves contained in North America’s unconventional oil and natural gas reservoirs through advanced techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. In recent years, this focus has resulted in exploration and production companies drilling longer horizontal wells, completing more hydraulic fracturing stages per well and utilizing more proppant per stage in an attempt to efficiently maximize the volume of hydrocarbon recovery per well. As a result, North American proppant demand, and particularly raw frac sand, increased rapidly over the same period.
Beginning in August 2014 and continuing through the second quarter of 2016, oil and natural gas prices declined dramatically in response to global supply concerns. Oil and natural gas prices persisted at levels well below those experienced during the middle of 2014. In response, U.S. exploration and production companies sharply reduced their drilling and completion activities in an effort to control costs. As a result, the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas fell dramatically in that same period from the high levels achieved during third quarter of 2014. Well completion activity throughout 2016 was significantly below levels experienced in 2014 and 2015. The combination of these and other factors reduced proppant demand and pricing during 2016 considerably from those realized during 2014. However, proppant demand did not decline as precipitously as rig count or well completion activity, due to the continuing trend of longer laterals and increasing use of proppant per lateral foot in well completions, all of which have positive impacts on frac sand demand. 
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 and continuing throughout 2017, North American rig count and well completion activity increased meaningfully over levels experienced in the middle of 2016. Demand for frac sand increased at a higher rate than well completion activity due to continued increases in proppant intensity per well. During the same time frame, frac sand supply increased at a slower rate, even with the resumption of operations at several previously idled mines. This dynamic led to a dramatic increase in frac sand pricing during the first quarter of 2017, which has continued to increase throughout 2017 and into 2018. 
Given the energy industry's outlook for 2018 activity levels, we expect well completion activity to continue to improve over the next several quarters, which, coupled with higher usage of frac sand per well, should result in an increased positive influence on demand for raw frac sand. Supply of frac sand is expected to increase in 2018 as development of new Permian Basin production facilities are completed and ramp up operations. However, we believe this new supply will lag further increases in demand, presenting continued positive impact on supply and demand dynamics, and therefore potentially preserving a constructive environment for pricing stability or improvement.
We utilize the significant oil and natural gas industry experience of our management team to take advantage of what we believe are favorable, long-term market dynamics as we execute our growth strategy, which includes the expansion of our integrated distribution system and PropStream logistics service, as well as potential development of new terminal facilities and other logistics related assets.

Assuming production at the rated capacity and based on a reserve report prepared by John T. Boyd, the Whitehall facility has an implied reserve life of 27 years as of December 31, 2017. As a result of market conditions, the Whitehall facility was temporarily idled during the second quarter of 2016 and resumed production in March 2017. 
All of the product from the Whitehall facility is shipped by rail from approximately 34,000 feet of track that connects the facility to a Canadian National Railroad mainline. These rail spurs and the capacity of the associated product storage silos allow us to accommodate a large number of rail cars, including unit trains.
Kermit Facility 
In March 2017, we acquired a 1,226-acre frac sand reserve, located near Kermit, Texas, strategically positioned in the Permian Basin, within 75 miles of significant Delaware and Midland Basin activity. On July 31, 2017, we completed construction of our fifth on-site processing plant capable of producing 3,000,000 tons per year (the "Kermit facility") and commenced operations. The Kermit facility, as of December 31, 2017, contained 103.6 million tons of proven recoverable reserves of frac sand meeting API specifications. Assuming production at the rated capacity and based on a reserve report prepared by John T. Boyd, the Kermit facility has an implied reserve life of 35 years as of December 31, 2017.
All of the product from our Kermit facility is delivered by truck to the wellsite from five on-site silos with 15,000 tons of storage capacity.
Terminal Facilities
As of December 31, 2017, we own or operate 12 terminal locations throughout Colorado, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York and Texas, of which two are temporarily idled and seven are capable of accommodating unit trains. Our terminals include approximately 109,000 tons of rail storage capacity and approximately 140,000 tons of silo storage capacity. Each terminal location is strategically positioned in the shale plays to facilitate efficient delivery of sand to the wellsite. Our terminals include rail-to-storage and rail-to-truck capabilities and serve as the majority of our terminal resources and materials management services. Our terminal facilities include origin and distribution material staging areas, rail track capabilities, material handling equipment, private rail fleet, bulk storage and quality assurance services.
Our terminals are strategically located to provide access to Class I railroads, which enables us to cost effectively ship product from our Wisconsin production facilities. As of December 31, 2017, we leased or owned 4,253 railcars used to transport sand from origin to destination and managed a fleet of approximately 2,404 additional railcars dedicated to our facilities by our customers or the Class I railroads. 
PropStream Operations 
In September 2016, the Partnership entered into an agreement to become a member of Proppant Express Investments, LLC ("PropX"), which was established to develop critical last mile logistics equipment for the proppant industry. In October 2016, the Partnership began providing to customers its PropStream integrated logistics service, which involves loading proppant at in-basin terminals into PropX containers before being transported by truck to the wellsite. The containers utilize intermodal container chassis or standard flatbeds for transportation, resulting in significant savings in terms of up-front and ongoing operations costs versus widely-used pneumatic equipment. PropStream provides increased transportation efficiency and reduces supply chain related congestion at the wellsite, decreasing the number of trucks required per job and decreasing or eliminating trucking demurrage costs. PropStream also provides flexible and scalable storage at the wellsite compared to silo solutions and more precise delivery of proppant into the blender hopper.

At the wellsite, the proprietary conveyor system, PropBeast®, significantly reduces noise and dust emissions due to its enclosed environment. PropBeast conveyors can transfer approximately 60,000 pounds of proppant per minute into blender hoppers while reducing particulate matter emissions from sand operations at the wellsite by more than 90% versus the widely used pneumatic equipment alternative. Our PropStream integrated logistics service is designed meet or exceed the new U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") respirable crystalline silica standards set to become effective in 2018 with respect to hydraulic fracturing, as well as the engineering control obligations set to become effective in 2021 for hydraulic fracturing.
As of December 31, 2017, we owned 22 PropBeast conveyors and leased 1,249 containers from PropX. 
Competitive Strengths
We believe that we are well positioned to successfully execute our strategy and achieve our primary business objectives to provide capital appreciation and increase our return to unitholders through cash distributions per unit and unit repurchases over time because of the following competitive strengths:

• | Competitive operating cost structure. Our plant operations have been strategically designed to provide low per-unit production costs. At our Wisconsin facilities, we benefit from shallow overburden, which provides for a lower cost structure than mining operations of reserves with deeper or more complex overburden. At our Kermit facility, our production costs benefit from a reserve base that is easily accessible with limited to no overburden. Our mining operations are subcontracted to a third-party excavation company at a fixed cost per ton excavated, subject to a diesel fuel surcharge. The strategic location and logistics capabilities of our portfolio of production facilities enables us to serve all major U.S. and Canadian oil and natural gas producing basins. All of our Wisconsin facilities are capable of accommodating unit trains, and enable efficient loading of frac sand and minimize rail car turnaround times at the facilities. Unlike many competitors, our processing and rail loading facilities are located on-site, which eliminates the requirement for on-road transportation, lowers product movement costs, minimizes degradation of sand quality due to handling at the origin and lowers environmental impact. Our Kermit facility, located in the heart of the Permian Basin, is capable of loading produced frac sand directly into the truck and is logistically advantaged with proximity to significant frac sand demand and wellsite locations. In addition, many of our terminals are capable of receiving and handling unit trains, further reducing the cost of delivered sand for our customers. Owning and operating our terminal network provides for reduced operating and freight costs, while also ensuring our customers receive priority scheduling, expedited delivery and a more cost-effective delivery alternative. 


• | Strategically located terminal facilities. We deliver our frac sand through an extensive logistics network of owned and operated rail-based terminals strategically located throughout Colorado, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York and Texas to serve our customers' operations in North America's shale and other unconventional oil and natural gas plays. Additionally, we have access to facilities owned and operated by third parties to further increase the reach of our logistics footprint and number of origin and destination pairings. Our distribution network allows us to better service our customers’ short-notice needs across basins, at a lower price, and provide our customers with solutions for the logistical challenges presented by the large volume of frac sand typically required for each well completion. Our network of terminals located in the Marcellus and Utica shale plays is situated within 50 miles of approximately 80% of all wells permitted in these shale plays in 2017, providing our customers with the opportunity for reduced trucking and logistics costs to deliver frac sand to the wellsite. Our three terminals in the Permian Basin, combined with the industry’s first operational in-basin mine at Kermit, provide a platform for efficient delivery of frac sand within 50 miles of approximately 80% of all wells permitted in the Permian Basin in 2017. 


• | "Last mile" service. Our PropStream integrated logistics service expands the reach and delivery of our production facilities and our owned and operated terminal network directly to our customers’ usage points, while leveraging our logistics infrastructure advantage and utilizing our strategically located terminal facilities. The development and expansion of "last mile" capabilities in our portfolio of services is aligned with our goals of delivering frac sand from the mine to the wellsite more efficiently. These efforts also expand our customer base by selling directly to the end users, and positioning our company deeper into the sand supply chain with delivery of sand to the blender hopper. PropStream reduces costs and environmental impact by simplifying the proppant delivery process through a fully flexible service. The PropStream service’s greater operating efficiency reduces non-productive time and demurrage costs at the wellsite, improves truck cycle times and enhances frac sand inventory management. The PropBeast conveyor system provides significant environmental benefits, including a reduction in silica dust by more than 90% as compared to the use of pneumatic trailers and other techniques, while also significantly reducing wellsite noise. PropStream benefits from superior accuracy and reliability through highly precise sand delivery and greater than 99% uptime efficiency, as well as gravity-fed loading and unloading, faster speeds load times and more consistent fills. The container size, and its mobility, enhances operational flexibility. We believe our customized PropStream service offering meets the specific needs of our customers today and is designed to do so as completion designs evolve.

• | Long-term customer relationships. We generate a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of frac sand to customers with whom we have long-term relationships, supported by contracts. The contracts specify annual minimum volume requirements for customers and have an average remaining contractual term of 2.6 years. In 2015 and 2016, as a result of the existing market dynamics, we provided our contract customers with temporary market pricing arrangements at a discount to certain contracted pricing levels. In 2017, we began to revise the pricing structure in our contracts for sand sourced from our Wisconsin facilities to be based on market pricing. Our contracts for sand sourced from our Kermit facility are generally fixed price for the life of the contract. We believe our long-term relationships with our customers provide us with a stable base of frac sand demand and cash flows. 


• | Experienced and incentivized management team. Our management team has extensive experience investing and operating in the oil and natural gas industry, long-term relationships with participants in the oilfield services and exploration and production industries, a strong operational and commercial understanding of the markets in which our customers operate, and expertise in development, construction and operation of frac sand processing and terminal facilities, frac sand supply chain management, and bulk solids material handling. Our management team is focused on optimizing our current business and expanding our operations through disciplined execution of our operational strategy of Mine. Move. Manage. Our management team and members of our general partner's board of directors are well-aligned with the interests of common unitholders through their combined 10% direct ownership interest in our limited partnership units and 39% interest in our sponsor, which owns 100% of the incentive distribution rights, whose value are directly impacted by prudent growth in profitability, cash flows and the business overall. 

Business Strategies
Our primary business objectives are to provide capital appreciation and increase our return to unitholders through cash distributions per unit and unit repurchases over time. We intend to accomplish this objective by executing the following strategies:

• | Capitalizing on compelling industry fundamentals. We intend to continue positioning ourselves as a premier provider of proppant and logistics solutions to the North American energy industry, as we believe the proppant and logistics market offers attractive growth fundamentals over the long-term. The innovations in horizontal drilling in the various North American shale basins and other unconventional oil and natural gas plays have resulted in greater demand for frac sand per well and per stage. The long-term growth in frac sand demand is underpinned by continued horizontal drilling, increasing frac sand use per well and cost advantages over other proppant types, including resin-coated sand and ceramics. Over the long-term, we believe increases in frac sand supply will be constrained by challenges associated with reliably matching the reserves and natural mesh size distribution with the logistics and customer needs, in the quantities required. Additionally, we expect ongoing difficulty with successfully obtaining the necessary local, state and federal permits required for operating proppant facilities and related infrastructure. 


• | Building on our position as a low cost provider. We seek to maintain and improve upon our position as a low cost provider of frac sand. We will continue to analyze and pursue organic expansion efforts that will similarly allow us to capitalize on and cost-effectively optimize our existing production and logistics assets. In addition, we seek to identify and evaluate additional terminal site locations to expand our geographic footprint allowing us to enhance our distribution network and ensure that our frac sand production is available to meet the evolving and dynamic in-basin needs of our customers. Further, we seek to find ways to reduce our customers' cost of frac sand delivered to the blender at the wellsite regardless of the source of production. We intend to accomplish this through a combination of our low cost production, our network of owned and operated terminals or third-party operated sites, our geographic footprint, and our PropStream integrated logistics service. We intend to continue to analyze and pursue opportunities to cost-effectively expand our geographic reach, optimize our existing assets and meet our customers' demand for our high quality frac sand. 


• | Focusing on long-term relationships with key customers. A key component of our business model has been our contracting strategy, which seeks to secure a high percentage of our volumes under long-term contracts with major pressure pumping service providers and oil and gas exploration and production companies. Our mix of fixed price and market price in our contracts for sand sourced from our Wisconsin facilities and our fixed price contracts for sand sourced from our Kermit facility provide us with a stable base of frac sand demand and cash flows, while also providing the flexibility we and our customers desire in the event of market changes. We believe this business model serves as the foundation for our ability to serve our customers, while reliably providing the product that is a critical component to the well completion process. We intend to utilize a substantial majority of our processing capacity to fulfill our customer contracts and continue to serve our existing and new customers with frac sand delivered through our distribution network and to the blender at the wellsite. 


• | Providing sand as a service. As we meet our customers' varied and evolving needs, we focus on the management of frac sand for our customers through "sand as a service". Through the development and deployment of PropStream, our last mile solution for delivery of sand, we leverage our capabilities to manage our customers' frac sand and logistics needs all the way from the mine to the blender at the wellsite. Our relentless focus on execution of our operations aligns our service with their needs for quality and reliability as we handle the frac sand production, transportation and management challenges faced every day. 

7


• | Pursuing accretive acquisitions. In June 2013, we acquired D&I, the owner of the largest distribution network in the Marcellus and Utica shale plays. The foundation of this acquisition enabled us to operate through an extensive logistics network of rail-based terminals, which today, has been expanded and is strategically located throughout Colorado, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York and Texas. In separate transactions in 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017, we acquired all of the equity interests in the Augusta, Blair and Whitehall facilities from our sponsor. In March 2017, we acquired a 1,226-acre frac sand reserve, located near Kermit, Texas from Permian Basin Sand. We expect to continue pursuing accretive acquisitions of third-party frac sand assets, including production facilities and/or distribution and logistics operations. As we evaluate acquisition opportunities, we intend to remain focused on operations that complement our reserves of premium frac sand, our portfolio of efficient production facilities, and assets that provide or would accommodate the development and construction of advantaged logistics and distribution capabilities. We believe these factors are critical to our business model and are important characteristics for any potential acquisitions. 


• | Maintaining financial flexibility and ample liquidity. We continue to pursue a disciplined financial policy and maintain liquidity aligned with our future financing needs and debt maturities. As of February 15, 2018, our senior secured term loan credit facility (the "Term Loan Credit Facility") that permits aggregate borrowings of $200.0 million was fully drawn with a $200.0 million balance outstanding and we had $104.3 million of undrawn borrowing capacity ($125.0 million, net of $20.7 million letter of credit commitments) and had no indebtedness under our senior secured revolving credit agreement (the "Revolving Credit Agreement"). The Revolving Credit Agreement is available to fund working capital and general corporate purposes, including the making of certain restricted payments permitted therein. Borrowings under our Revolving Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets. In January 2017, we entered into an equity distribution program under which we may sell through or to certain financial institutions up to $50.0 million in common units. In addition, in 2017 and 2016, we completed four public offerings for a total of 43,125,000 common units for aggregate net proceeds of $601.6 million. We believe that our borrowing capacity and ability to access debt and equity capital markets provides us with the financial flexibility necessary to achieve our organic expansion and acquisition strategy. 

Our Industry 
The oil and natural gas proppant industry is comprised of businesses involved in the mining or manufacturing of the propping agents used in the drilling and completion of oil and natural gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing is the most widely used method for stimulating increased production from wells. The process consists of pumping fluids, mixed with granular proppants, into the geologic formation at pressures sufficient to create fractures in the hydrocarbon-bearing rock. Proppant-filled fractures create conductive channels through which the hydrocarbons can flow more freely from the formation into the wellbore and then to the surface.
Industry Data
The market and industry data included throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K was obtained through our own internal analysis and research, coupled with industry publications, surveys, reports and other analysis conducted by third parties. Industry publications, surveys, reports and other analysis generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, although they do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. Although we believe that the industry reports are generally reliable, we have not independently verified the industry data from third-party sources. Although we believe our internal analysis and research is reliable and appropriate, such internal analysis and research has not been verified by any independent source.
Types of Proppant
There are three primary types of proppant that are commonly utilized in the hydraulic fracturing process: raw frac sand, resin-coated sand and manufactured ceramic beads. We are engaged exclusively in the production of raw frac sand.
Raw Frac Sand
Of the three primary types of proppant, raw frac sand is the most widely used due to its broad applicability in oil and natural gas wells and its cost advantage relative to other proppants. Raw frac sand has been employed in nearly all major U.S. oil and natural gas producing basins.
Raw frac sand is generally mined from the surface or underground, and in some cases crushed, and then cleaned, dried and sorted into consistent mesh sizes. The API has a range of guidelines it uses to evaluate frac sand grades and mesh sizes. In order to meet API specifications, frac sand must meet certain thresholds related to crush strength (ability to withstand high pressures), roundness and sphericity (facilitates hydrocarbon flow, or conductivity), particle size distribution, turbidity (low levels of contaminants), acid solubility and percent quartz (mineralogy). Oil and gas producers generally require that frac sand used in their drilling and completion processes meet API specifications.

Raw frac sand can be further delineated into three main types: Northern White, Brady Brown and what is commonly referred to as "In-Basin" frac sand. The term "Northern White" is a commonly-used designation for premium white sand produced in Wisconsin and other limited parts of the upper Midwest region of the United States. Northern White, which is the type of frac sand we produce at our Wisconsin facilities, is known for its high crush strength, low turbidity, roundness and sphericity and monocrystalline grain structure. Northern White frac sand has historically commanded premium prices relative to Brady Brown. Brady Brown, or regional sand, is sometimes preferred due to its proximity to shale basins, particularly the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford shale plays, and, therefore, lower cost due to reduced logistics costs. In-Basin frac sand began to be developed and produced in 2017 and is used in the Permian Basin due to its proximity and logistics advantage. We produce Northern White and In-Basin frac sand at our production facilities. 
Resin-Coated Frac Sand
Resin-coated frac sand consists of raw frac sand that is coated with a flexible resin that increases the sand’s crush strength and prevents crushed sand from dispersing throughout the fracture. Pressured (or tempered) resin-coated sand primarily enhances crush strength, thermal stability and chemical resistance, allowing the sand to perform under harsh downhole conditions. Curable (or bonding) resin-coated frac sand uses a resin that is designed to bond together under closure stress and high temperatures, preventing proppant flowback. We do not produce resin-coated frac sand, but from time to time, we may purchase or transload resin-coated frac sand for use by our customers. 
Ceramics
Ceramic proppant is a manufactured product of comparatively consistent size and spherical shape that typically offers the highest crush strength relative to other types of proppants. Ceramic proppant derives its product strength from the molecular structure of its underlying raw material and is designed to withstand extreme heat, depth and pressure environments. We do not produce ceramic proppant, but from time to time, we may purchase or transload ceramic proppant for use by our customers. 
Proppant Mesh Sizes
Mesh size is used to describe the size of the proppant and is determined by sieving the proppant through screens with uniform openings corresponding to the desired size of the proppant. Each type of proppant comes in various sizes, categorized as mesh sizes, and the various mesh sizes are used in different applications in the oil and natural gas industry. The mesh number system is a measure of the number of equally sized openings per square inch of screen through which the proppant is sieved. For example, a 30 mesh screen has 30 equally sized openings per linear inch. Therefore, as the mesh number increases, the granule size decreases. In order to meet API specifications, 90% of the proppant described as 30/50 mesh size proppant must consist of granules that will pass through a 30 mesh screen but not through a 50 mesh screen. We excavate various mesh sizes at our facilities, and sell 20/40, 30/50, 40/70 and 100 mesh frac sand used in the hydraulic fracturing process.
Demand Trends
Demand growth for frac sand and other proppants is primarily driven by advancements in oil and natural gas drilling and well completion technology and techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, as well as overall industry activity growth. These advancements have made the extraction of oil and natural gas increasingly cost-effective in formations that historically would have been unprofitable to develop, resulting in a greater number of wells being drilled. Demand for proppant declined in 2015 and throughout most of 2016 with reduced well completion activity; however, we believe that demand for proppant will continue to grow, as it did throughout 2017, over the long-term, primarily driven by the increase in the average amount of proppant consumed per horizontal rig and as a result of the following demand drivers:

• | improvements in drilling rig productivity (from, among other things, pad drilling), resulting in more wells drilled per rig per year;


• | increases in the number of wells drilled per acre;


• | increases in the length of the typical horizontal wellbore;


• | increases in the number of fracture stages per lateral foot in the typical completed horizontal wellbore;


• | increases in the volume of proppant used per fracturing stage; and


• | recurring efforts to offset steep production declines in unconventional oil and natural gas reservoirs, including the drilling of new wells and secondary hydraulic fracturing of existing wells.

As demand for raw frac sand increased dramatically through 2014, the supply of raw frac sand failed to keep pace, resulting in a supply-demand disparity. As a result, a number of existing and new competitors announced supply expansions and greenfield projects. However, there are several key geological, operational and economic constraints to increasing raw frac sand production on an industry-wide basis, including:

• | the difficulty of finding frac sand reserves that meet API specifications and consisting of the mesh size in demand;


• | the difficulty of securing contiguous frac sand reserves large enough to justify the capital investment required to develop a processing facility with a higher base of fixed costs;


• | the challenges of identifying frac sand reserves with the above characteristics that either are located in close proximity to oil and natural gas reservoirs or have rail access needed for low-cost transportation to major shale basins;


• | the hurdles of securing mining, production, water, air, refuse and other federal, state and local operating permits from the proper authorities;


• | local opposition to development of facilities, especially those that require the use of on-road transportation, including hours of operations and noise level restrictions, in addition to moratoria on raw frac sand facilities in multiple counties in Wisconsin and other states which hold potential sand reserves; and


• | the typically long lead time required to design and construct sand processing facilities that can efficiently process large quantities of high quality frac sand.

As a result of the decline in oil and natural gas exploration and production activity that took place in 2015 and throughout most of 2016, many announced expansions or greenfield projects were significantly delayed or canceled. In addition, several existing facilities were temporarily or permanently idled, often due to high cost of production.
Recommencement of production at facilities previously idled often requires significant maintenance costs, use of working capital to build sufficient wet sand inventory for processing and hiring of employees if previously laid off. As a result, we do not believe some idled facilities will re-enter the market until frac sand pricing has reached a sustained and higher level to incentivize the investment.
In 2017, several new and existing suppliers announced planned capacity additions of frac sand supply, particularly in the Permian Basin. We expect frac sand supply to lag growth in demand over the coming months and quarters. While planned capacity may exceed the expectations for frac sand demand, the collectively available industry capacity is constrained due to 1) availability of the grades of sand that are currently in demand, 2) general operating conditions and normal downtime and 3) logistics constraints. The industry is expected to add capacity over the next 12 to 18 months, particularly in the Permian Basin; however, we do not expect such supply to be available in the volume grades or timeframe needed to efficiently meet the increasing demand. The advent of "In-Basin" sand supply available closer to the wellsite in the Permian Basin may cause a shift in supply over time from Northern White sand to In-Basin sand supply. However, we believe this shift will be specific to finer mesh sizes of sand, particularly 100 mesh which is the principal grade produced in-basin. Northern White supply of 100 mesh is likely to shift to meet the demand for sand in other basins, with other grades of Northern White continuing to find a market in the Permian Basin. While these shifts may cause periodic mismatches of supply and demand in particular basins, we do not believe there will be a long-term oversupply of sand given the projections of increasing demand. 
Pricing
Given the expectation for increased oil and natural gas exploration and production activity in North America, coupled with the increased demand per well, and the limitations to increase sand supply noted above, frac sand pricing has risen throughout 2017 and into the first quarter of 2018, and we believe is likely to be more favorable in 2018.
There are numerous grades and sizes of proppant which sell at various prices, dependent primarily upon the delivery point, and also quality, grade of proppant, deliverability and many other factors.  Pricing of proppant sold at the terminal is higher than pricing of proppant sold FOB plant as a result of the associated transportation and handling costs to bring the sand from the mine to the terminal. No reliable publicized pricing information for raw sand exists. However, it is believed that the overall pricing trends tend to be consistent across the various sizes and within regions with some variation due to transportation costs, resulting from distance from the source. We believe a significant amount of proppant is sold under long-term contracts with varying pricing mechanisms, with the remainder being sold under short-term pricing arrangements.
Customers and Contracts
Our current customer base includes major pressure pumping service providers and oil and gas exploration and production companies. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales to each of Halliburton Company ("Halliburton") and Liberty Oilfield Services ("Liberty") accounted for greater than 10% of our total revenues. 
10

We sell the majority of the frac sand we produce to customers with whom we have long-term contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated 73% of our revenues from sales of frac sand to customers with whom we had long-term contracts. We expect to continue selling a majority of our sand to our customers with long-term contracts in 2018 and future years. As of January 1, 2018, our long-term contracts have an average remaining contractual term of 2.6 years with remaining terms ranging from 12 to 84 months. 
The terms of our customer contracts, including sand quality requirements, quantity parameters, permitted sources of supply, effects of future regulatory changes, force majeure and termination and assignment provisions, vary by customer. Our contracts contain penalties for non-performance by our customers. If one of our customers fails to meet its minimum obligations to us, make-whole payments, combined with the decrease in our variable costs (such as production costs, royalty payments and transportation costs), can mitigate the adverse impact on our cash flow from such failures. In addition, we have the ability to sell these sand volumes to third parties. 
Our long-term customer contracts also contain penalties for our non-performance. If we are unable to deliver contracted volumes or otherwise arrange for delivery from a third party, we may be required to pay make-whole payments. We believe our production facilities, substantial reserves and our on-site processing and logistics capabilities reduce our risk of non-performance. We believe our levels of inventory are sufficient to prevent us from paying make-whole payments as a result of plant shutdowns due to repairs to our facilities necessitated by reasonably foreseeable mechanical interruptions.
In addition to sales under our long-term contracts, we sell raw frac sand under short-term pricing and other agreements. The terms of our short-term pricing agreements, including sand quality requirements, quantity parameters, permitted sources of supply, effects of future regulatory changes, force majeure and termination and assignment provisions, vary by customer.
Suppliers 
Although the majority of the frac sand that we sell is produced from our production facilities, we can purchase, and have purchased in the past, a certain amount of frac sand and other proppant from various third parties for sale to our customers. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2015, the Partnership purchased 142,019 and 96,151 tons, respectively, from third parties. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Partnership did not purchase any sand from third parties.  
Our Operations 
Frac Sand Excavation Operations
Raw frac sand is a naturally occurring mineral that is mined and processed. While the specific extraction method utilized depends primarily on the geologic setting, most raw frac sand is mined using conventional open-pit bench extraction methods. The composition, depth and chemical purity of the sand also dictate the processing method and equipment utilized. For example, broken rock from a sandstone deposit may require one, two or three stages of crushing to produce sand grains required to meet API specifications. In contrast, unconsolidated deposits (loosely bound sediments of sand), like those found at our Wyeville facility, may require little or no crushing during the excavation process. 
The surface excavation operations at our production facilities are conducted by a third-party contractor. The mining technique at our production facilities is open-pit excavation of approximately 20-acre panels of unconsolidated silica deposits. At our Augusta, Blair, Whitehall and Kermit facilities the excavation process involves clearing vegetation and trees, if any, overlying the proposed mining area. Additionally, limited blasting procedures are conducted at our Augusta, Blair and Whitehall facilities. The initial two to five feet of overburden is removed and utilized to construct perimeter berms around the pit and property boundary. No underground mines are operated at our production facilities.
A track excavator and articulated trucks are utilized for excavating the sand at several different elevation levels of the active pit. The pit is dry mined, and the water elevation is maintained below working level through a dewatering and pumping process. The mined material is loaded and hauled from different areas of the pit and different elevations within the pit to the primary loading facility at our mines' on-site wet processing facilities. We pay a fixed fee per ton of sand excavated, subject to a diesel fuel surcharge.
At our Wyeville facility, in addition to surface excavation, sand is also mined through dredging operations.  Silica deposits are extracted from the ground with water.  The resulting slurry is transported via pipeline to the wet processing facility. Similar to surface excavation operations, the dredging at our Wyeville facility is performed by a third party contractor.
Processing Facilities 
Our processing facilities are designed to wash, sort, dry and store our raw frac sand, with each plant employing modern and efficient wet and dry processing technology.
11

Our mined raw frac sand is initially stockpiled before processing. The material is recovered by a mounted belt feeder, which extends beneath a surge pile and is fed onto a conveyor. The sand exits the tunnel on the conveyor belt and is fed into the wet plant where impurities, such as clay and organic particles, and unusable fine grain sand are removed from the raw feed. The wet processed sand is then stockpiled in advance of being fed into the dry plant for further processing. The Wisconsin wet plants operate for seven to eight months per year due to the limitations arising from sustained freezing temperatures during winter months. When in operation, our Wisconsin wet plants process more sand per day than the dry plants can process to build up stockpiles of frac sand that will be processed by the dry plants during the winter months. The Kermit wet plant operates year round and therefore the stockpiles of frac sand are processed by the dry plants in a shorter timeframe.
The wet processed sand stockpile is fed into the dry plant hopper using a front end loader. The material is processed in a natural gas fired vibratory fluid bed dryer contained in an enclosed building. After drying, the sand is screened through gyratory screens and separated into industry standard product sizes. The finished product is then conveyed to multiple on-site storage silos for each size specification and our railcar loads are tested to ensure that the delivery meets API specifications. Oil and gas producers increasingly require current testing and proof that frac sand used in their drilling and completion processes meet API specifications.
Logistics Capabilities 
Most frac sand is shipped in bulk from the processing facility to terminal facilities, or directly to the customers by truck, rail or barge. For bulk raw frac sand, transportation costs often represent a significant portion of the customer’s overall product cost. Consequently, shipping in large quantities, particularly by unit train when shipping over long distances, provides a significant cost advantage to the customer, emphasizing the importance of rail or barge access for low cost delivery. As a result, facility location and logistics capabilities are among the most important considerations for producers, distributors and customers.
All of the product sold from our Wyeville and Augusta facilities is shipped by rail from approximately 32,000 feet and 38,000 feet, respectively, of track that connects our facilities to a Union Pacific Railroad mainline. All of the product sold from our Blair and Whitehall facilities is shipped by rail from approximately 45,000 feet and 34,000 feet, respectively, of track that connects our facility to a Canadian National Railroad mainline. These rail spurs, size of the rail yards and the capacity of the associated product storage silos allow us to accommodate a large number of rail cars, including unit trains, which significantly increases our efficiency in meeting our customers’ frac sand transportation needs. All of the product sold from our Kermit facility is delivered by truck to the wellsite from five on-site silos with 15,000 tons of storage capacity. 
Terminal Operations
We generally operate our terminal locations under long-term lease agreements with third party operators or short-line rail companies. Some of these lease agreements include performance requirements, which typically specify a minimum number of rail cars that must be processed by us each year through the terminal. Each owned or operated terminal location is strategically positioned in the shale plays so that our customers typically do not need to travel more than 75 miles from the wellsite to purchase their frac sand requirements. Our terminals include rail-to-truck and, at silo storage locations, rail-to-storage capabilities.
Once the frac sand is loaded into rail cars at the origin, we utilize an extensive network through a combination of Class I and short-line railroads to move the sand to our terminals. For our terminals with silo storage capabilities, frac sand is loaded into delivery trucks directly from our silos. Our silos deploy sand via gravity at 10 tons per minute to trucks stationed directly on scales under each silo with the loading, electronic recording of weight and dispatch of the truck capable of being completed in less than five minutes. Silos are considerably more efficient than conveyors, which require trucks to be loaded and then moved to separate scales to be weighed; however, frac sand can also be unloaded to delivery trucks directly via a conveyor. 
PropStream Operations
Our PropStream integrated logistics service involves loading proppant at in-basin terminals into PropX containers before being transported by truck to the wellsite. The 8-foot cubic purpose-built containers each transport up to 33,000 pounds of proppant and, depending on Department of Transportation and local regulations, allow for the transport of up to 55,000 pounds per truck.  The containers utilize intermodal container chassis or standard flatbeds for transportation, resulting in significant savings in terms of up-front and ongoing operations costs versus widely-used pneumatic equipment.  PropStream provides increased transportation efficiency and reduces supply chain related congestion at the wellsite, decreasing the number of trucks required per job and decreasing or eliminating trucking demurrage costs. PropStream also provides flexible and scalable storage at the wellsite compared to silo solutions and more precise delivery of proppant into the blender hopper.
At the wellsite, the PropBeast conveyor system significantly reduces noise and dust emissions due to its enclosed environment.  PropBeast conveyors can transfer approximately 60,000 pounds of proppant per minute into blender hoppers while reducing particulate matter emissions from sand operations at the wellsite by more than 90% versus the widely used pneumatic equipment alternative. Our PropStream integrated logistics service is designed to meet or exceed the new OSHA respirable crystalline silica standards set to become effective in 2018 with respect to hydraulic fracturing, as well as the engineering control obligations set to become effective in 2021 for hydraulic fracturing.

Competition
There are numerous large and small producers in all sand producing regions of the United States with which we compete. Our main public and private competitors include:

• | U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SLCA) 


• | Unimin Corporation ("Unimin")


• | Fairmount Santrol Holdings, Inc. ("Fairmount") (NASDAQ: FMSA)


• | Badger Mining Corporation


• | Emerge Energy Services LP (NYSE: EMES)


• | Smart Sand, Inc. (NASDAQ: SND)

On December 12, 2017, Unimin and Fairmount announced a planned merger. In addition, there are several Permian Basin production facilities anticipated to become operational in 2018. As these Permian Basin production facilities become operational, our main competitors could change. 
The most important factors on which we compete are price, reliability of supply, transportation capabilities, product quality, performance and sand characteristics. Demand for frac sand and the prices that we will be able to obtain for our products are closely linked to proppant consumption patterns for the completion of oil and natural gas wells in North America. These consumption patterns are influenced by numerous factors, including the price for hydrocarbons, the drilling rig count and hydraulic fracturing activity, including the number of stages completed and the mesh size and amount of proppant used per stage. Further, these consumption patterns are also influenced by the location, quality, price and availability of proppant.

In addition, we contract our excavation and trucking operations to third parties and accordingly have no employees involved in those operations.
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Regulation 
Mining and Workplace Safety
Federal Regulation
The U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA") is the primary regulatory agency with jurisdiction over the commercial silica industry. Accordingly, MSHA regulates quarries, surface mines, underground mines, and the industrial mineral processing facilities associated with quarries and mines. As part of MSHA’s oversight, its representatives must perform at least two unannounced inspections annually for each surface mining facility in its jurisdiction. To date, these inspections have not resulted in any citations for material violations of MSHA standards.
We also are subject to the requirements of the OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities, and the public. OSHA regulates the users of commercial silica and provides detailed regulations requiring employers to protect employees from overexposure to silica through the enforcement of permissible exposure limits and the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard.
Health and Safety Programs
We adhere to a strict occupational health program aimed at controlling employee exposure to silica dust, which includes a silicosis prevention program comprised of routine dust sampling, medical surveillance, training, and other components. Our safety program is designed to ensure compliance with MSHA and OSHA regulations. For both health and safety issues, extensive training is provided to employees. We have safety meetings at our plants with salaried and hourly employees that are involved in establishing, implementing and improving safety standards. We perform annual internal health and safety audits and conduct annual crisis management drills to test our abilities to respond to various situations. Health and safety programs are administered by our corporate health and safety department with the assistance of plant Environmental, Health and Safety Coordinators.
Environmental Matters
We and the commercial silica industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation pertaining to matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, hazardous materials, air and water emissions, and environmental contamination and reclamation. A variety of federal, state and local agencies have established, implement and enforce these regulations.
Federal Regulation
At the federal level, we may be required to obtain permits under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands and streams, in connection with our operations. We also may be required to obtain permits under Section 402 of the Clean Water Act from the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") or the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources ("Wisconsin DNR") or the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality ("TCEQ"), to whom the EPA has delegated local implementation of the permit program, for discharges of pollutants into waters of the United States, including discharges of wastewater or stormwater runoff associated with construction activities. Failure to obtain these required permits or to comply with their terms could subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief.
The U.S. Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. These regulatory programs may require us to install expensive emissions abatement equipment, modify operational practices, and obtain permits for existing or new operations. Before commencing construction on a new or modified source of air emissions, such laws may require us to reduce emissions at existing facilities. As a result, we may be required to incur increased capital and operating costs to comply with these regulations. We could be subject to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the U.S. Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations.
14

As part of our operations, we utilize or store petroleum products and other substances such as diesel fuel, lubricating oils and hydraulic fluid. We are subject to regulatory programs pertaining to the storage, use, transportation and disposal of these substances. Spills or releases may occur in the course of our operations, and we could incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or releases, including claims for damage or injury to property and persons. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA," also known as the Superfund law) and comparable state laws may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed of or arranged for disposal, including offsite disposal, of a hazardous substance generated or released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
In addition, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. The EPA and Wisconsin DNR and TCEQ, to which the EPA has delegated portions of the RCRA program for local implementation, administer the RCRA program.
Our operations may also be subject to broad environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"). NEPA requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of all "major federal actions", which could include a major development project, such as a mining operation, significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, our projects may require review and evaluation under NEPA. As part of this evaluation, the federal agency considers a broad array of environmental impacts, including, among other things, impacts on air quality, water quality, wildlife (including threatened and endangered species), historic and archaeological resources, geology, socioeconomics and aesthetics. NEPA also requires the consideration of alternatives to the project. The NEPA review process, especially the preparation of a full environmental impact statement, can be time consuming and expensive. Though NEPA requires only that an environmental evaluation be conducted and does not mandate a particular result, a federal agency could decide to deny a permit or impose certain conditions on its approval, based on its environmental review under NEPA, or a third party could challenge the adequacy of a NEPA review and thereby delay the issuance of a federal permit or approval.
Federal agencies granting permits for our operations also must consider impacts to endangered and threatened species and their habitat under the Endangered Species Act. We also must comply with and are potentially subject to liability under the Endangered Species Act, which prohibits and imposes stringent penalties for the harming of endangered or threatened species and their habitat. Federal agencies also must consider a project’s impacts on historic or archaeological resources under the National Historic Preservation Act, and we may be required to conduct archaeological surveys of project sites and to avoid or preserve historical areas or artifacts.
State and Local Regulation
We are also subject to a variety of state and local environmental review and permitting requirements. Some states, including Wisconsin where our Northern White production facilities are located, have state laws similar to NEPA; thus our development of a new site or the expansion of an existing site may be subject to comprehensive state environmental reviews even if it is not subject to NEPA. In some cases, the state environmental review may be more stringent than the federal review. Our operations may require state-law based permits in addition to federal permits, requiring state agencies to consider a range of issues, many the same as federal agencies, including, among other things, a project’s impact on wildlife and their habitats, historic and archaeological sites, aesthetics, agricultural operations, and scenic areas. Wisconsin, Texas and some other states also have specific permitting and review processes for commercial silica mining operations, and state agencies may impose different or additional monitoring or mitigation requirements than federal agencies. The development of new sites and our existing operations also are subject to a variety of local environmental and regulatory requirements, including land use, zoning, building, and transportation requirements.
Certain local communities in which we operate, primarily in Wisconsin, have developed or are in the process of developing regulations or zoning restrictions intended to minimize the potential for dust to become airborne, control the flow of truck traffic, significantly restrict the area available for mining activities and require compensation to local residents for potential impacts of mining, among other regulatory initiatives. In addition, our existing permits granted by local regulatory authorities contain certain restrictions on such matters as hours of operation, permitted decibel levels and lighting, among other matters.
The regulatory framework in the jurisdictions in which we do business is potentially subject to amendments or modifications. Planned expansion of our existing facilities as well as the development of new facilities could be significantly impacted by increased regulatory activity. Delays or inability to obtain required permits for expansion of existing facilities, or the development of new facilities, as well as the increased costs of compliance with future state and local regulatory requirements could have a material negative impact on our ability to grow our business. In an effort to minimize these risks, we continue to be engaged with local communities in order to grow and maintain strong relationships with residents and regulators.
15

Costs of Compliance
We may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of environmental, health, and safety requirements applicable to our activities. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; imposition of investigatory, cleanup, and site restoration costs and liens; the denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations; and the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations may also increase the cost of the development, construction, and operation of our projects and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given project. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property may result from environmental and other impacts of our activities.
The process for performing environmental impact studies and reviews for federal, state, and local permits required for our operations involves a significant investment of time and monetary resources. We cannot control the permit approval process. We cannot predict whether all permits required for a given project will be granted or whether such permits will be the subject of significant opposition. The denial of a permit essential to a project or the imposition of conditions with which it is not practicable or feasible to comply could impair or prevent our ability to develop a project. Significant opposition and delay in the environmental review and permitting process also could impair or delay our ability to develop a project. Additionally, the passage of more stringent environmental laws could impair our ability to develop new operations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Permits
We operate our facilities under a number of federal, state and local authorizations.
Texas Production Facility
Our Texas production facility currently operates under permit by rule air permits from the TCEQ.
Stormwater discharges from the production facility is currently permitted under the Texas Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("TPDES") administered by TCEQ; however, a notice of termination was recently filed and is under review with the TCEQ, and the permit will be terminated shortly as construction activities covered by the permit have ceased and are complete. A new Notice of Intent for the TPDES general construction permit must be filed for any new construction project that may require the general permit.
The site has three septic permits issued by Winkler County. Systems are maintained as appropriate.
Operations are also covered by an Aggregate Production Operations permit issued by TCEQ. The permit will be renewed every year, until operations cease.
The production facility is currently undergoing consultant design and review for submittal of two applications for the permitting of two drinking (potable) water wells and associated drinking water systems. TCEQ must review and approve the well permits and drinking water system permits prior to the production facility construction of the wells and installing and operating the drinking water systems. Once those permits are issued, the production facility would operate the associated drinking water systems in accordance with the public drinking water standards. The permits once issued become permanent until the wells and/or drinking water systems are terminated.
Wisconsin Production Facilities
Our Wisconsin production facilities currently operate under construction and operation air permits from the Wisconsin DNR. Each production facility operates under an operation air permit, with the exception of Wyeville; at our Wyeville facility, we have complied with the construction air permit and have requested an operational air permit from the Wisconsin DNR. All production facilities, have developed and are in compliance with a Fugitive Dust Control Plan and a Malfunction Prevention and Abatement Plan.
Stormwater discharges from our Wisconsin production facilities are permitted under the Wisconsin Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("WPDES") administered by Wisconsin DNR; and, at our Augusta facility, also under the Eau Claire County Storm Water Management and Erosion Control ordinance. An updated Notice of Intent for the WPDES general construction permit, which would include modifications to the existing storm water management and erosion control structures for an expansion at any production facility is submitted to and approved by the Wisconsin DNR. All Wisconsin production facilities are currently covered by WPDES general construction permits for various projects.
Our Wisconsin production facilities have federal and state certifications and/or permits for the filling and/or taking of wetlands associated with our construction and/or operational activities.
Our mining operations are subject to the conditions of nonmetallic mining permits granted and administered by either the County, City or Township in which we operate. We submit updated nonmetallic mining plans to the relevant regulatory authority as may be required in the event of a proposed expansion of any mining operation.
We utilize groundwater through the installation and operation of high capacity wells, located at our Augusta and Blair facilities. High capacity well permits are issued and administered by the WDNR and are subject to annual (or monthly) withdraw limitations. 
16

We routinely monitor our water withdrawals, and also utilize a water recycling system to return production water and/or stormwater to minimize the water we need from those high capacity groundwater wells.
Terminal Facilities
We operate our terminal facilities under various federal, state and local authorizations.  Although the list of permits we obtain in order to commence and maintain our operations at each facility vary by location, we are typically required to obtain, among other permits and authorizations, air, land development, local building and highway occupancy permits.  We are also occasionally required to obtain a wetlands permit.
