Item 1.  Business.
Overview
 Great Elm has undergone a significant transformation in the last year. We:
  
▪ | changed our leadership;
--+------------------------


▪ | closed on our first investment management business opportunity; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | explored a number of acquisition and investment opportunities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 Our goal is to build a holding company focused on return on investment and long-term value creation.  We will accomplish this principally through:
  
▪ | continuous review of acquisitions of businesses, securities and assets that have the potential for significant long-term value creation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | effective use of the skills of our team, our financial resources, including our tax assets, our willingness to create bespoke solutions and our ability to prudently assume risks; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | evaluating the retention and disposition of our operations and holdings.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our first investment for long-term value creation was in the investment management business.  In June 2016, we invested $30 million in GECC. On November 3, 2016, Full Circle Capital Corporation (Full Circle), a business development company (BDC), merged with and into GECC.  In this investment management business, we have the opportunity to:
  
▪ | earn management and administrative fees;
--+-----------------------------------------


▪ | earn incentive fees if GECC meets financial targets; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


▪ | hold our GECC shares to generate dividends or sell our GECC shares to redeploy our capital in higher yielding opportunities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We continue to explore other opportunities in the investment management business including, but not limited to, transactions with other BDCs that trade at a discount to their net asset value, as well as the creation of closed-end investment vehicles.
 As of June 30, 2017, we had $1.7 billion of net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes.
 Our corporate headquarters is located at 800 South Street, Suite 230, Waltham, Massachusetts 02453 and our phone number is (617) 375-3006. Our corporate website address is www.greatelmcap.com. The information contained in, or accessible through, our corporate website does not constitute part of this report.  We are a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1994 and completed our initial public offering in 1999.
 Our Divested Patent Business
 On April 6, 2016, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Optis providing for the sale of the entities that conducted our patent licensing business (the Divestiture).  The Divestiture was completed on June 30, 2016.
 In the Divestiture, we received $34.2 million in gross cash proceeds, inclusive of reimbursement of $4.2 million of agreed upon expenses, and may be entitled to up to an additional $10 million cash payment on June 30, 2018. Optis has claimed that it has losses indemnifiable under the purchase and sale agreement in excess of the $10 million contractual payment due on June 30, 2018.  As a result, we have not recognized any portion of the $10 million in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the periods presented. Our legacy patent business is reflected in our financial statements as discontinued operations.
 Great Elm Capital Corporation ― Our Business Development Company Investment
 We decided to invest in the asset management business because of our assessment of its ability to generate recurring free cash flows, its growth prospects and our board of directors’ industry expertise.

On June 23, 2016, GECC entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Full Circle (the Merger Agreement) and entered into a subscription agreement (the Subscription Agreement) with us and private investment funds (the MAST Funds) managed by MAST Capital Management, LLC (MAST Capital).
 We contributed $30 million in cash to GECC.  As of June 30, 2016, GECC was our wholly-owned subsidiary and it is consolidated in our June 30, 2016 financial statements.  On September 27, 2016, the MAST Funds contributed to GECC a portfolio of debt investments that had a November 3, 2016 fair value of approximately $90 million.  Following the MAST Funds contribution, GECC elected to be treated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act).
 On November 3, 2016:
  
▪ | Full Circle merged with and into GECC (the Merger) in exchange for shares of GECC common stock, and GECC’s common stock became listed on the NASDAQ Global Market;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Great Elm Capital Management, Inc., our wholly-owned registered investment adviser subsidiary (GECM), is the external investment adviser to GECC; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | GECM hired all of the employees of MAST Capital and acquired all of the infrastructure used by our GECM team.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have two opportunities to generate free cash flow from GECC.
 Under the investment management agreement (IMA) with GECC that is an exhibit to this report, GECM will be entitled to:
  
▪ | management fees measured by GECC’s gross assets (other than cash and cash equivalents, including investments in money market funds);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | an incentive fee if GECC’s net investment income exceeds a hurdle rate; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | an incentive fee based on GECC’s capital gains.
--+------------------------------------------------

 We also earn an administration fee based on the reimbursement of the portion of GECM’s expenses allocable to GECC.
 We own approximately 17% of GECC’s shares that we may hold to generate dividends or sell to redeploy our capital in higher yielding opportunities.  Our GECC shares are registered for re-sale; however, we agreed that we would not sell these shares until November 3, 2017, but we may finance these shares during that holding period to generate liquidity before our contractual holding period expires.
 In September 2017, we entered into a Separation Agreement that separated our business from MAST Capital and restructured many of these arrangements. 
 Acquisition Program
 GECM’s team also is developing an active acquisition program for us in the investment management business, in select real estate opportunities and in operating businesses.  In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, we evaluated a number of opportunities but were unwilling to pay the significant multiples that the sellers received from third parties.
Competition
 We face competition from larger, well financed organizations (both domestic and foreign), including operating companies, global asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, private equity funds, sovereign wealth funds and state owned enterprises.  Government regulation is a key competitive factor.
Employees
 We had sixteen employees as of June 30, 2017; two in our parent company, seven in investment management and seven providing shared services.
