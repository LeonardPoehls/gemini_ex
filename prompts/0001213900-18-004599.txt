Item 1. Business.
 
Minn Shares was incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 22, 2010 to effect the reincorporation (the “Reincorporation”) of Minn Shares Inc., a Minnesota corporation (“Minn Shares Minnesota”), in the State of Delaware. On December 1, 2010 the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Minn Shares Minnesota, pursuant to which Minn Shares Minnesota was merged with and into the Company. Following the merger, Minn Shares Minnesota ceased to exist and the Company assumed all of the rights, liabilities and obligations of Minn Shares Minnesota.
 
Pursuant to an agreement and plan of securities exchange dated November 22, 2016 (the “Titan Exchange Agreement”), by and among Minn Shares, Titan CNG LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Titan”), and the holders of 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Titan, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Titan in exchange for 248,481 shares (taking into account the Company’s subsequent 50-for-1 reverse stock split) of the Company’s common stock (the “Titan Share Exchange”). The number of shares of common stock issued in the Titan Share Exchange represented approximately 91.25% of the Company’s total outstanding shares of common stock on a post-transaction basis. Accordingly, the Titan Share Exchange resulted in a change in control of the Company.
 
The Titan Share Exchange was accounted for as a reverse acquisition transaction. Upon completion of the Titan Share Exchange, the business plan of Titan became the business plan of the Company and all former officers of the Company resigned and were replaced by officers designated by Titan.
 
On November 23, 2016, the Company and Shock Inc., a Delaware corporation owned by John P. Yeros, Kirk S. Honour and Randy Gilbert (“Shock”), entered into an agreement and plan of merger whereby Shock merged with and into the Company (the “Shock Merger”), the separate corporate existence of Shock ceased, and all issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Shock were converted into 44,899 shares (taking into account the Company’s subsequent 50-for-1 reverse stock split) of the Company’s common stock.
 
On January 11, 2017, the Company entered into a securities exchange agreement with Environmental Alternative Fuels, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“EAF”), EVO CNG, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of EAF (“EVO”), Danny R. Cuzick (“Danny Cuzick”), Damon R. Cuzick, Theril H. Lund and Thomas J. Kiley (together with Danny Cuzick, the “EAF Members”). In accordance with the terms of the securities exchange agreement, the Company acquired all of the membership interests of EAF from the EAF Members and, in exchange, issued a promissory note in the principal amount of $3.8 million to Danny Cuzick and convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $9.5 million to the EAF Members (the “EAF Share Exchange”).
 
Before the Titan Share Exchange, the Shock Merger and the EAF Share Exchange (collectively, the “Restructuring”), the Company had no or nominal operations or assets and could be considered a “shell company” as defined under Rule 405 of the Securities Act and Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. The business and operations of Titan, Shock, EAF and EVO prior to the Restructuring currently constitute a substantial majority of the business and operations of Minn Shares. Consequently, the discussion of historical and planned operations in this report focuses, in large part, on the operations of Titan, Shock, EAF and EVO. Following the Restructuring, Minn Shares continues to be a “smaller reporting company” as defined under the Exchange Act.
 
On April 6, 2017, the Company effected a 50-for-1 reverse stock split of its common stock pursuant to which each 50 shares of issued and outstanding common stock became one share of common stock (the “Reverse Split”). No fractional shares were issued as a result of the Reverse Split. All references to numbers of shares of common stock and per share amounts give retroactive effect to the Reverse Split for all periods presented.


Effective August 31, 2017, Minn Shares changed its name to EVO Transportation & Energy Services, Inc.

Market Overview
 
Management believes that there is an immediate opportunity to capture market share in the growing U.S. natural gas vehicle fueling market. According to the United States Department of Energy, in December 2017, natural gas was selling at retail in the United States at approximately $2.17 per gas gallon equivalent (“GGE”) while gasoline and diesel were selling for approximately $2.49 and $2.90 per gallon, respectively. Management expects this disparity to remain intact for the foreseeable future, which would create a strong economic incentive for vehicle operators to switch to CNG. In addition, CNG is a significantly cleaner fuel than is gasoline or diesel and creates less engine wear, thereby making its use even more desirable. Natural Gas Vehicles of America (“NGV America”) estimates that as of December 2017, there were approximately 1,750 natural gas fueling stations, with 153,000 natural gas vehicles, including commercial vehicles in the United States.


Management believes that the natural gas industry is ripe for growth in the United States. According to NGV America, a natural gas trade publication, as of 2016 there were more than 22.4 million natural gas vehicles in the world. Global usage of natural gas vehicles has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 21.6% for the last decade. The United States currently has approximately 250 million total vehicles in operation, of which approximately 150,000 consist of natural gas vehicles. As a result, management expects the United States to experience rapid growth in the NGV and natural gas industries for the foreseeable future.

Approximately 44 billion gasoline gallon equivalents are consumed by fleet customers in the United States annually. The United States Energy Information Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook 2014 report estimates that the heavy truck market will consume 12 billion diesel gallon equivalents (“DGEs”) annually in the United States by 2040. Natural gas currently represents less than 0.1% of the fuel consumed by the fleet industry, which management views as the largest segment of our current target market.
 
Traditional natural gas produces up to 21% less greenhouse gases than gasoline and diesel on a well-to-wheels basis according to NGV America. Renewable natural gas can achieve a reduction in greenhouse gases of greater than 100% according to Argonne National Laboratory. At the same time, CNG produces over 90% fewer particulate emissions than diesel according to the Department of Energy. Several municipalities are encouraging the use of natural gas trucks to promote cost savings and quieter, cleaner operations in urban settings.
 
With the technological advances in natural gas drilling and production, including horizontal drilling techniques and hydraulic fracturing, the natural gas reserves in the United States has made the county the highest volume producer of natural gas in the world. Management expects that corporations and state and local governments in the United States seeking a long-term, reliable, and stably priced transportation fuel source will increasingly look to natural gas as an alternative and viable solution to gasoline and diesel due to the abundance of the resource.
 
Historically, the federal government and numerous state and local governments have offered grants and tax rebates, and have passed regulations promoting the use of natural gas as an alternative vehicle fuel source. In addition, many state and local governments operate natural gas vehicles and have become anchor customers for public CNG stations to promote CNG usage. AFTC, which was designed to promote natural gas usage in the United States, was reinstated retroactively with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. In addition, management expects federal, state and local governments to offer similar tax credits and other incentives moving forward to promote the use of natural gas due to its economic, safety and environmental benefits.


Natural gas is considered safer than petroleum products because natural gas dissipates into the air when spilled, which significantly reduces the risk of fire caused by spilled fuel. Natural gas ignites at very high temperatures and a very narrow oxygen concentration band, making it less ignitable than gasoline. Also, CNG poses a lesser threat of soil or groundwater contamination as it is stored in above-ground tanks.
 
The United States has a robust natural gas distribution infrastructure that supplies gas to consumers for purposes of home heating and electrical power generation. Large-diameter, high-pressure gas lines provide natural gas throughout most parts of the country. While pipelines are in place, there are still very few retail CNG fueling stations. California is the current industry leader in developing CNG stations as part of its clean air initiative.
 
Management believes the opportunity for natural gas as a vehicle fuel source is sustainable and growing in the United States. In particular, fleets, especially those operated by large corporations, are continuing to convert vehicles to run on natural gas as opposed to gasoline or diesel for both environmental and economic reasons. We believe that these trends will continue for the foreseeable future.
 
Competition
 
The vehicle fuels market is highly competitive and in a state of rapid development. As a smaller provider of alternative vehicle fuels, we face numerous barriers to market entry. We compete directly with other operators of CNG fueling stations and indirectly with gasoline, diesel and other alternative vehicle fuels markets, including but not limited to ethanol, biodiesel, LNG, hydrogen, hybrid and electric vehicle markets. Gasoline and diesel producers and providers own a vast majority of the market share of the vehicle fuels industry. New developments and improvements to existing technologies continue to create volatility in the alternative fuels markets. Many of our competitors in the gasoline, diesel, and alternative fuels industries have access to greater financial and other resources than Minn Shares. Demand for natural gas in the vehicle fuels industry is subject to price considerations, reliability, availability, convenience and accessibility, environmental considerations, government incentive programs, and safety considerations, among other factors.

We compete directly with both private and public operators of CNG fueling stations. The private market for CNG fueling solutions is currently served by a few larger operators and a number of smaller operators with a few stations. The following are the primary competitors of EVO Inc. serving the CNG market:
 

● | Large competitors, including Clean Energy, TruStar, Love’s Travel Stops (formerly Trillium), and U.S. Gain; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Smaller competitors, including CNG 4 America, Questar Fueling, Clean N’ Green, IGS CNG Services, Freedom CNG, Sparq, and Piedmont Natural Gas; and 
● | Public operators of CNG fueling stations, including state and local governments. 

Strategy
 
Our goal is to capitalize on the current and anticipated growth in the use of natural gas vehicle fuels and to advance our leadership position in the vehicle fuels market. To achieve this end, we are pursuing the following strategies:

● | Acquire existing CNG stations. EVO Inc. intends to identify, analyze, and acquire CNG fueling stations, with a particular focus on stations in the Midwest, West and Southwest regions of the United States. We will seek to acquire CNG fueling stations that have demonstrated or anticipated above-average sales growth and profit potential. Management analyzes potential acquisition targets based on a set of assessment criteria, which includes the following factors: 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | demographic markets and geographic suitability; 
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | status of station performance; 
--+-----------------------------------


● | potential upside in performance improvement; 
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | sales efficiency processes and resources; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | service market penetration opportunity. 
--+--------------------------------------------

 
As we identify specific acquisition targets, management will analyze each targeted CNG station to determine if it is a suitable acquisition target. If we determine that a potential target meets our criteria, then we will move toward more formal discussions with the target’s ownership. Once negotiations are completed and acquisition documents, including any financing documents, are finalized, we will complete the transaction and begin to implement our operating plans with respect to the acquired station.
 

● | Open public stations on the back of anchor fleet customers. We target high-volume fleet customers such as public transit, refuse haulers, regional trucking companies, vehicle fleets that serve airports and seaports and large national companies with distribution and service vehicles. For example, the Titan Diamond Bar station serves the SCAQMD as an anchor customer. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Open private stations serving fleets under take-or-pay contracts. We intend to leverage our expertise in building and operating CNG stations by serving fleet customers that wish to have their own private station to fuel vehicles overnight using a time-fill system and during the day with a fast-fill capability. 
● | Emphasize superior customer service. We work closely with our customers to understand their specific needs and provide relevant solutions.

Our Target Customers
 
We target corporate and government fleet customers. Our initial focus is on fleet customers with vehicles that run the same or similar routes each day. We believe that these customers will benefit most immediately from the economic advantages available through CNG usage. Specific types of fleets targeted are:
Corporate Fleets:
 
Class 8 Truck Fleets: Management believes the largest market for CNG is in the Class 8 truck market. Class 8 trucks use more fuel than any other class of vehicle. With more and more trucking operators running dedicated routes for shippers, the Class 8 market will make the biggest impact on adoption of CNG.
 
Waste Haulers: Management believes that waste haulers are a natural target market for CNG. A typical garbage truck has a fuel economy of two to three miles per gallon and returns to its base each day, making the base a logical location for a CNG fueling station. Republic Services and Waste Management, the two largest refuse fleet operators in the United States, have both converted significant portions of their fleets to natural gas.
 
Oilfield Service Fleets: Oilfield service truck fleets operate in an out-and-back model that we believe is well-suited for a home depot refueling option.
 
Local Day Job Fleets: We believe that local jobbers that are high mileage users in a defined location represent an excellent target market.
 
Airport Shuttle Buses: Shuttle bus fleets can leverage common infrastructure around an airport and off-the-shelf engine conversion options.
 
Government Fleets:
 
City Buses: Many municipalities, such as Los Angeles, California operate buses that run on CNG.
 
Municipal Trash Haulers: The same opportunity exists here as for corporate fleets.
 
Other Government Fleets: Federal, state and local governments operate a wide range of fleet vehicles and could benefit from the economic and environmental advantages of NGVs.
Tax Rebate Opportunity
 
Historically, the federal government offered AFTC, formerly VETC enabling the Company to receive a tax credit of $.50 per GGE of CNG sold for vehicle fuel use. The AFTC was first offered on October 1, 2006 and expired December 31, 2016, and reinstated for 2017. Although we previously availed ourselves of the AFTC, our business is not dependent on tax credits, grants, or other incentives from federal, state or local governments. However, when available, we plan to pursue actively federal and state tax credits and other incentives to lower development and operating costs.
Principal Customers & Suppliers
 
When assessing prospective locations for new CNG fueling stations, we often target high-volume fleet operators to serve as anchor customers at the stations. Once an anchor-customer relationship has been established, we typically seek to minimize construction and sourcing costs by tapping into existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure to supply the customer’s CNG needs. Consequently, we often have a principal customer at our CNG fueling stations.
 
Titan Diamond Bar. The Titan Diamond Bar station was constructed primarily to meet the fueling needs of the SCAQMD (State of California South Coast Air Quality Management District). However, the station services existing and new retail customers as well.
 
EAF Tolleson. Our primary customer at the EAF Tolleson station is Frito Lay. EAF entered into an incremental natural gas facilities agreement dated February 24, 2014 with Southwest Gas Corporation (“Southwest Gas”). Under the terms of the agreement, Southwest Gas agreed to install a pipeline connecting the station to its existing infrastructure at no upfront cost to EAF, and EAF agreed to use Southwest Gas to transport natural gas to the station through its infrastructure. The term was originally five years but has since been modified to be ten years. Each year of the ten-year term, EAF is required to make a payment to Southwest Gas equal to $70,565 minus the amount of delivery and demand charges paid by EAF during the applicable contract year. EAF is required to provide financial security in the form of a letter of credit originally in the amount of $510,763, which amount decreases each year during the term of the agreement and was equal to $306,458 as of December 31, 2016 and 2017.

EAF Oak Creek. EAF entered into a fuel purchase agreement dated January 11, 2013 with Sheehy Mail Contractors, Inc. (“Sheehy”) to sell CNG to Sheehy at its EAF Oak Creek fueling station, which opened in December of 2013, at agreed upon prices set forth in the agreement. The initial four-year term expires in December 2018, but management expects to extend the term of the agreement. Integrys Energy Services – Natural Gas, LLC agreed to supply natural gas to the station pursuant to a master retail gas sales agreement with EVO dated November 1, 2013 and a related confirmation agreement dated January 27, 2015. The initial term of the agreement with Integrys Energy Services – Natural Gas, LLC expires February 2019.
 
EAF Jurupa Valley. Our principal customer at the EAF Jurupa Valley station was Swift. Swift owns the real estate underlying the EAF Jurupa Valley station and leases the property to EVO pursuant to an oral month-to-month lease agreement. Under the terms of the lease agreement, EVO agreed to construct a CNG fueling station and to make provisions for the installation of a natural gas supply line to the property in order to meet Swift’s CNG fueling needs. EVO entered into a line extension contract dated April 3, 2014 with Southern California Gas Company to serve as the supplier of CNG to the station. Southern California Gas Company agreed to install a pipeline connecting its existing infrastructure to the northwest border of the EAF Jurupa Valley property at no cost to EVO or Swift, provided that at least 2.4 million DGE is pumped in any 12-month period during the first three years of operation. EVO agreed to pay $290,000 for installation of a pipeline across the property to connect the fueling station to the new line laid by Southern California Gas Company. During December 2017, Swift ended their use of CNG trucks. Management believes it can replace Swift and is actively marketing the location. The station is in a highly industrialized area with significant trucking activity.


EAF San Antonio. EAF entered into an agreement with Central Freight Lines, Inc. (“Central Freight”) to sell CNG to Central Freight at the EAF San Antonio station at agreed upon prices set forth in the agreement. The agreement has an initial term of five years expiring September 2018. To meet Central Freight’s CNG needs, EAF entered into a natural gas service and pipeline agreement dated November 12, 2014 with LDC, llc (“LDC”), pursuant to which LDC agreed to construct a pipeline and deliver natural gas to EAF at the station. EAF agreed that LDC will be its exclusive supplier of natural gas at the facility.
 
EAF Fort Worth. Central Freight is also our principal customer at the EAF Fort Worth Facility. The fuel purchase agreement for the EAF Fort Worth station has an initial four-year term expiring April 2019, and EAF agreed to supply CNG to Central Freight at agreed upon prices set forth in the fuel purchase agreement.
 
EAF Lake Arlington. EAF Lake Arlington is a station that management believes is positioned to provide excellent virtual pipeline opportunities. It is in a highly industrialized area and management believes that there is great potential to be able to use the station to transport natural gas to customers that may not be able to get natural gas at their facilities due to pipeline constraints.
 
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
 
We are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws related to permitting and licensing, environmental health, accidental release prevention, above-ground storage tanks, hazardous waste and hazardous materials, and station design, among other subject areas. Management believes the Company is in material compliance with all regulatory and environmental compliance requirements. Regulatory compliance costs are difficult to estimate but historically have not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
