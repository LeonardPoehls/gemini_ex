 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
  
  Our History
  
  The Company (formerly California Cyber Design, Inc. (“CCDI”)) was incorporated in Delaware on May 27, 1998 and changed its name to American Financial Holdings, Inc. (“AFHI”) on August 11, 2004.  AFHI, a publicly-traded corporation with no operations, announced the completion of its share exchange transaction with Pelican Mobile Computers, Inc., a Maryland corporation (“Pelican Mobile”), on January 6, 2006. Pelican Mobile exchanged each issued and outstanding share of Pelican Mobile Computers (1,000 shares issued and outstanding at the time of the share exchange) for 25,000 shares of AFHI on a post-split basis (the “Share Exchange”) with an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of common stock of AFHI issued to the former stockholders of  Pelican Mobile.  At the time of the Share Exchange, the existing stockholders of AFHI retained 5,512,103 shares of AFHI’s outstanding common stock after the cancellation of approximately 2,549,000 shares of common stock. As a result, the former stockholders of Pelican Mobile became the majority stockholders of AFHI. Under the terms of the Share Exchange, the Company changed its name to Tactical Solution Partners, Inc. On April 25, 2008, the Company’s stockholders approved a proposal to change its name from Tactical Solution Partners, Inc. to Brekford International Corp. to better reflect our business strategy. Subsequently, on July 9, 2010, the Company’s stockholders approved a proposal to change our name from Brekford International Corp. to Brekford Corp. On October 27, 2010, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the merger of Pelican Mobile with Brekford Corp. pursuant to Section 253 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, with Brekford Corp. as the surviving corporation. The merger became effective upon the filing of a Certificate of Ownership and Merger with the State of Delaware (and the appropriate Articles of Merger with the State of Maryland), pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger. The merger documents were filed with the States of Delaware and Maryland on October 28, 2010. Effective upon the completion of the merger, the Company’s corporate name of the Company remained as Brekford Corp. The operations of Pelican Mobile were continued by the Company without interruption following the merger.

  Automated Traffic Safety Enforcement– Red Light and Speed Camera Systems
  
  Public safety is a major concern for most communities – especially as populations grow, and yet there is continual pressure on public safety budgets. One way to help make streets safer while reducing workload is a well-run photo red light or speed enforcement program. The objective of photo enforcement is to help curtail aggressive driving through voluntary compliance. Revenue generated from fines routinely goes directly back into supporting other public safety initiatives.
  
  Although opponents of red light cameras cite the increase in rear end collisions as cause for disapproval of cameras, a study conducted in February 2011 by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (the “IIHS”) reported that red-light cameras reduced fatal red light running crashes by 24% in 14 large U.S. cities with populations over 200,000.  IIHS concluded that if red light cameras had been operating in all 99 U.S. cities with populations over 200,000 during this study period (five years), a total of 815 deaths could have been avoided.  Because the types of crashes prevented by red light cameras tend to be far more severe than rear-end crashes, research has shown there is a net positive benefit. Photo enforcement solutions can reduce collisions, injuries and deaths by providing a useful tool for municipalities and law enforcement agencies, without unduly taxing drivers who do not break the law. Today, nearly 600 communities across the U.S. operate red light or speed camera enforcement programs.
  
  Despite the increased safety effects and prevention of fatalities, there is still a common misconception that automated traffic safety enforcement systems are not supported by the general public.  An IIHS survey conducted in November 2012 found that a large majority of people living in Washington, D.C., one of the largest combined red light and speed enforcement programs in the U.S., favor camera enforcement.  Of those surveyed, 87% support red light cameras and 76% support speed cameras.  Even the majority of violators (59%) agreed that they deserved their most recent citation. In 2012, IIHS reported that 633 people were killed and an estimated 133,000 were injured in crashes that involved red light running.  Speeding was a factor in 31% of motor vehicle crash deaths in 2012.
  
  Brekford’s ATSE products offer intersection safety (red light), speed, and cell phone enforcement options by way of a complete suite of solution-based products.  Our team of industry professionals has extensive experience in this field, we have developed equipment and a full turnkey solution that we believe will ensure the success of any program.  We have created and implemented some of the most cutting-edge features into our design while constructing end-to-end systems specifically with our clients’ needs in mind.
  
  ATSE systems are one of a wide range of measures that are effective at reducing vehicle speeds and crashes. The ATSE system is an enforcement technique with one or more motor vehicle sensors producing recorded images of motor vehicles traveling at speeds above a defined threshold. Images captured by the ATSE system are processed and reviewed in an office environment and violation notices are mailed to the registered owner of the identified vehicle. ATSE is a technology available to law enforcement as a supplement and not a replacement for traditional enforcement operations. Evaluations of ATSE, both internationally and in the United States have identified some advantages over traditional speed enforcement methods.  These include:
  
 
● | High rate of violation detection. ATSE units can detect and record multiple violations per minute. This can provide a strong deterrent effect by increasing drivers’ perceived likelihood of being cited for speeding.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Physical safety of ATSE operators and motorists. ATSE can operate at locations where roadside traffic stops are dangerous or infeasible, and where traffic conditions are unsafe for police vehicles to enter the traffic stream and stop suspected violators. With ATSE there is normally no vehicle pursuit or confrontation with motorists. ATSE might also reduce the occurrence of traffic congestion due to driver distraction caused by traffic stops on the roadside.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fairness of operation. Violations are recorded for all vehicles traveling in excess of the enforcement speed threshold. Efficient use of resources. ATSE can act as a “force multiplier,” enhancing the influence of limited traffic enforcement staff and resources. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
  Beyond traditional tax collection on income or property, state agencies and local municipalities rely heavily on fine and fee revenue generated from a multitude of violator-funded sources.  For example, jurisdictions generate sizable revenues from court fees, traffic and parking violations, ordinance infractions, and library and utility arrearages. Each of these revenue sources funds public safety and community development initiatives and without the income, the services are curtailed. Brekford offers client-specific solutions to these agencies and municipalities to assist them with collecting unpaid fines, including:
  
 
● | Notification continuance 
--+-------------------------------------------
● | Mail house and printing 
● | Data purification and verification 
● | Back office support 
● | Call center response (inbound & out bound)
● | Lock-box & treasury 
● | Payment processing

  Vehicle Services
  
  Prior to March 1, 2017, part of Brekford’s business included sales of products and services focusing on law enforcement vehicles. These products and services included rugged information technology solutions, mobile data, digital video, electronic ticketing, and vehicle upfitting. Rugged information technology solutions included both ruggedized laptops and in-car video solutions, among other technology offerings, in addition to vehicle mounting systems, docking stations, and custom-built packages. Vehicle upfitting solutions included the turnkey installation of various components including rugged technology, as well as sirens, lights, radios, gun racks, and decals. .
  
  As previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 7, 2017, on February 6, 2017, the Company entered into a Contribution and Unit Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with LB&B Associates Inc. (the “Purchaser”) and Global Public Safety, LLC (“GPS”).
  
  The closing for the transaction set forth in the Agreement occurred on February 28, 2017 (the “Closing”) and on such date the Company contributed substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities related to its vehicle services business (the “Business”) to GPS. After the Closing, Brekford will continue to own and run other business operations that are not related to the Business.
  
  On the Closing, GPS sold units representing 80.1% of the units of GPS to the Purchaser for $6,048,394, after certain purchase price adjustments of prepaid expenses and unbilled customer deposits. $4,048,394 was paid in cash, including a $250,000 deposit that was paid on February 6, 2017, and $2,000,000 was paid by Purchaser issuing the Company a promissory note (the “Promissory Note”). After the Closing, Brekford continues to own 19.9% of the units of GPS.
  
  The Promissory Note is subordinated to the Purchaser’s senior lender and accrues interest at a rate of 3% per annum. The maturity date of the Promissory Note is March 31, 2022. The Promissory Note is to be repaid as follows: (a) $75,000 plus all accrued interest on each of September 30, 2017; December 31, 2017; March 31, 2018, June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2018 (or, in the event any such date is not a business day, the first business day after such date), (b) $100,000 plus all accrued interest on each of December 31, 2018; March 31, 2019; June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2019 (or, in the event any such date is not a business day, the first business day after such date) (c) $125,000 plus all accrued interest on each of December 31, 2019; March 31, 2020; June 30, 2020; September 30, 2020, December 31, 2020; March 31, 2021, June 31, 2021; September 30, 2021; and December 31, 2021 (or, in the event any such date is not a business day, the first business day after such date), and (d) $100,000 on March 31, 2022.
  
  The Promissory Note is secured pursuant to the terms of a Pledge Agreement (the “Pledge Agreement”) between the Company and Purchaser. Pursuant to the Pledge Agreement the Purchaser granted the Company a continuing second priority lien and security interest in the Purchaser’s units of GPS subject to liens of the Purchaser’s senior lender.

  Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company and GPS executed a Transition Services Agreement (the “Transition Services Agreement”). Pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, the Company will perform certain support services to promote the efficient transition of the Business for the fees set forth in the Agreement.
  
  In connection with the Agreement the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Global Public Safety, LLC (the “LLC Agreement”). The LLC Agreement provides for the operations of GPS and provides that all limited liability company powers of the Company shall be exercised by and under the authority of the Board of Representatives except as otherwise provided by the LLC Agreement or applicable law. The initial number of representatives constituting the Board of Representatives is three, of which the Company appointed one member and if the number of Board of Representatives is increased the Company shall be able to appoint the number of members required to maintain 1/3 of the seats on the Board of Representatives.
  
  Pursuant to a month-to-month sublease agreement between GPS and the Company, the Company will continue to occupy 3,362 square feet of office space, located at 7020 Dorsey Road, Suite C, Hanover, Maryland 21076.
  
  The Company also entered into a Pre-Novation Agreement with GPS pursuant to which performance under certain contracts being assigned to GPS will be made while these contracts are being assigned to GPS. The Company will also enter into a Novation Agreement pursuant to which the government contracts being assigned to GPS will be transferred.
  
  With respect to information provided within this Annual Report, including management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results, the sale transaction was contemplated as having been completed as of December 31, 2016. Products and services related to vehicle services have been treated as discontinued operations within this Annual Report.
  
  Purchasing and Order Fulfillment
  
  We work with manufacturers and distributors to secure the lowest cost possible while taking advantage of any available incentives in order to provide competitive pricing and minimize delivery time to our customers while maintaining our product margins. Typically, once we sign an ATSE contract with our customers, we then purchase required components from manufacturers and assemble the camera systems at our facility in Hanover, Maryand. Sales generally are for services only, with Brekford maintaining ownership of provided hardware and software.
 Merger Agreement
  
  As reported on Amendment Number 1 to a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 14, 2017, on February 10, 2017, Brekford entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) to combine the businesses of Brekford and KeyStone Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“KeyStone”). The Merger Agreement provides that Brekford and KeyStone will each engage in merger transactions (the “Mergers”) with separate wholly-owned subsidiaries of a newly-formed company, Novume Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Novume”). Under one merger transaction (the “Brekford Merger”), one wholly-owned subsidiary of Novume will merge with and into Brekford, leaving Brekford as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Novume. Under a separate merger transaction (the “KeyStone Merger”), KeyStone will merge with and into another wholly-owned subsidiary of Novume (“KeyStone Merger Sub”), with KeyStone Merger Sub surviving such merger. The time at which the Mergers are completed in accordance with the Merger Agreement is referred to as the “Effective Time”. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Brekford will change its name to “Brekford Traffic Safety, Inc.” and KeyStone Merger Sub will change its name to “KeyStone Solutions, Inc.”

  Merger Consideration
  
  As consideration for the Mergers, each outstanding share of the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Brekford (“Brekford Common Stock”) immediately prior to the Effective Time will become convertible into and exchangeable for 1/15th of a share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Novume (“Novume Common Stock” and such ratio, the “Brekford Exchange Ratio”). Each outstanding share of the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of KeyStone (“KeyStone Common Stock”) immediately prior to the Effective Time, will become convertible into and exchangeable for 1.9975 shares of Novume Common Stock, and each outstanding share of the Series A Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of KeyStone (“KeyStone Preferred Stock”) will become convertible into and exchangeable for 1.9975 shares of the Series A Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock of Novume (“Novume Preferred Stock” and such ratio, the “KeyStone Exchange Ratio”). The outstanding warrants and options to purchase shares of Brekford Common Stock and KeyStone Common Stock, as applicable, shall be exchanged for warrants and options to purchase Novume Common Stock at the Brekford Exchange Ratio or the KeyStone Exchange Ratio, as applicable. Collectively, the forgoing is referred to herein as the “Merger Consideration”.
  
  The Merger Consideration, and each of the Brekford Exchange Ratio and the KeyStone Exchange Ratio, were determined so that, immediately after the Effective Time, the pre-merger stockholders of Brekford will own such portion of the capital stock of Novume as shall be equal to approximately 20% of the issued and outstanding NovumeCommon Stock, on a fully-diluted basis, and the pre-merger stockholders of KeyStone will own that portion of the capital stock of Novume as is equal to approximately 80% of the issued and outstanding Novume Common Stock, on a fully-diluted basis.
  
  Closing Conditions
  
  The closing of the Merger Agreement will take place upon the fulfillment or waiver of all of the conditions to closing set forth in Article VIII of the Merger Agreement or as soon thereafter as practicable, but not later than June 1, 2017, unless otherwise mutually agreed by Brekford and KeyStone. One closing condition is that each of Brekford and KeyStone receive all stockholder approvals and corporate approvals required by the Delaware General Corporations Code and the organizational documents of each company to complete the Mergers. This satisfaction of this condition is assured. On February 10, 2017, the board of directors of Brekford authorized and approved the Mergers and the adoption of the Merger Agreement. On the same day, Chandra Brechin, a member of Brekford’s Board of Directors, Scott Rutherford, Brekford’s Chief Strategic Officer and a member of its Board of Directors and Robert West, a member of the Board of Directors of Brekford who own an aggregate of 25,712,787 shares of Brekford Common Stock, which represent approximately 52.13% of the issued and outstanding shares of Brekford's Common Stock entered into separate agreements (“Voting Agreements”) with Brekford pursuant to which they separately agreed with Brekford to vote all of their shares in favor of the Brekford Merger and against any action or transaction that would delay or compromise the ability of Brekford to effectuate the Mergers. On February 9, 2017, the board of directors of KeyStone (the “KeyStone Board”) authorized and approved the Mergers and the adoption of the Merger Agreement. On the same date, certain holders of more than 51% of the issued and outstanding shares of KeyStone Common Stock entered into Voting Agreements with KeyStone, and such holders indeed delivered written consents to KeyStone approving the Mergers and adopt the Merger Agreement.
  
  A second closing condition requires Novume to prepare and file a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (the “Registration Statement”), which shall be declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) prior to the Effective Time, registering the Merger Consideration. This shall not include registration of the options issuable as Merger Consideration in exchange for options previously received by stockholders of Brekford under Brekford’s 2008 Director’s Compensation Plan or stockholders of KeyStone under KeyStone’s 2016 Equity Award Plan, which are intended to be registered separately on a Registration Statement on Form S-8 after the Effective Time. The Registration Statement will include an information statement of Brekford, which Brekford shall distribute to its stockholders in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, prior to the Effective Time. In furtherance of this condition, Novume filed the Registration Statement with the SEC on February 10, 2017. The Registration Statement remains subject to the SEC’s review and comment, and to amendment, as appropriate, by Novume.
  
  Finally, prior to the Effective Time, Novume shall enter into five-year employment agreements with each of Scott Rutherford, Brekford’s current Chief Strategy Officer, and Rodney Hillman, Brekford’s current President and Chief Operating Officer (the “Employment Agreements”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement Mr. Rutherford shall serve as Chief Technology Officer and Mr. Hillman shall serve as President and Chief Operating officer of Brekford Traffic Safety, Inc.
  
  Under the Merger Agreement, Novume shall use its best efforts, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, to obtain listings for Novume Common Stock, Novume Preferred Stock and certain warrants to purchase Novume Common Stock on a national stock exchange, or, alternatively, to obtain quotations for such securities on the OTCQX.
  
 
   
5


  
 
  Leadership of Novume
  
  The leadership of Novume shall be substantially comprised of the current management of KeyStone.
  
  At the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Novume (the “Novume Board”), shall have seven (7) members, four (4) of whom shall be independent within the meaning of the Exchange Act, and the national stock exchange to which Novume intends to apply for listings of the Novume securities indicated above. Six (6) members of the Novume Board shall be designated by KeyStone, and one (1) member of the Novume Board shall be designated by Brekford, subject to the approval of KeyStone.
 Termination Fee
  
  If (i) the Merger Agreement (A) is terminated by KeyStone due to the withdrawal of the recommendation of the Merger Agreement by the board of directors of Brekford (the “Brekford Board”), or by Brekford or KeyStone because of the failure to obtain the requisite Brekford stockholders’ approval, or (B) is terminated as a result of Brekford’s material breach of its obligations with regard to Closing and to filing and distributing of the Registration Statement required for the transaction, which breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after notice thereof to Brekford, and (ii) at the time of such termination there shall have been an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) involving Brekford or any of its subsidiaries (whether or not such offer shall have been rejected or shall have been withdrawn prior to the time of such termination), Brekford shall pay KeyStone a termination fee of $250,000 (the “Termination Fee”). The Termination Fee shall be payable in cash at the date of termination.
 Business Strategy
  
  Brekford’s ATSE solutions include speed and red-light camera technologies that are increasingly in demand, as well as parking enforcement solutions with a complete turnkey backend citation management software suite. The U.S. market for red-light systems is estimated at 20,000 to 30,000 systems and the market for speed cameras is estimated at 35,000 to 50,000 systems. According to the IIHS, as of December 2016, 426 communities have red light cameras currently operating and 142 communities have speed cameras operating in at least one location. We have established a foothold in this business by securing contracts with several municipalities in the Mid-Atlantic region, and we are currently implementing plans for national and international expansion. There are only a handful of competitors that are currently providing ATSE services with three companies that are considered leaders of this industry. Management believes that the Company possesses technical and operational advantages over its competitors. Due to our flexible customized solutions and superior customer service, we believe we are poised to capture increased market share in the U.S., Mexico, and other countries in the near future.
 Competition
  
  Although we operate in an industry that has experienced substantial growth in recent years, it is also characterized by customers and states with vastly different requirements for photo enforcement operations. Further, although there are only a handful of competitors in our industry, competition among those companies is intense. Larger competitors tend to invest significant capital in business development and lobbying efforts, providing them with more leverage in terms of acceptance and contract awards. We believe that our technology, size, and strategy provide more flexibility when bidding on contracts in smaller to medium sized municipalities which collectively constitutes the majority of installation opportunities within the U.S.
  
  To address these competitive pressures and industry trends, we intend to grow revenues by:
  
 
● | Increasing ATSE installation and services (speed, red light, and parking) both nationally and internationally. The global economic environment may present opportunities and challenges in the year ahead, yet municipalities will still need to address road safety issues and photo-enforcement is a crucial tool in that task;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Refining our strategy to focus on smaller and medium-sized customers, in states that enable ATSE technology, where we are able to profitably provide high quality solutions; and 


● | Continuing to invest in research and development to ensure that out technologies remain at the forefront of the industry.

  Customers
  
  The Company has several ATSE contracts with government agencies, of which net revenue from four customers during the year ended December 31, 2016 represented 63% of the total net revenue. Four customers accounted for 88% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2016, which was subsequently collected in 2017.
  
  Net revenue from five customers during the year ended December 31, 2015 represented 80% of the total net revenue. Accounts receivable due from three customers at December 31, 2015 amounted to 91% of total accounts receivable at that date.
  
  Vendors
  
  The Company purchased products and services for fulfillment of ATSE contracts from several vendors. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, accounts payable due to these vendors amounted to 47% and 38% of total accounts payable, respectively.
 Government Contracts and Regulation
  
  All companies engaged in supplying equipment and services to government agencies, either directly or by subcontract, are subject to business risks. Government contracts generally contain provisions permitting termination, in whole or in part, without prior notice at the government’s convenience, as well as termination for default based on lack of performance. Upon termination for convenience, we generally would be entitled to compensation only for work done, supplier costs and termination liability at the time of termination and to receive an allowance for profit on the work performed. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future government contracts and orders. Furthermore, on government contracts for which we are a subcontractor and not the prime contractor, the government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, which would likely result in the termination of our subcontract.
 Future Legislation
  
  Because much of our business growth involves providing traffic enforcement solutions to governmental agencies and municipalities, the future passage of laws and regulations affecting red light camera and speed camera systems could have a material adverse impact on our business. Camera-operated traffic enforcement solutions have recently been the subject of significant public criticism and legislators in various jurisdictions have introduced, or have indicated that they intend to introduce, legislation to better monitor and control traffic enforcement activities. For example, legislation passed in Maryland in 2014 imposes a civil penalty on enforcement contractors if they issue erroneous citations on behalf of a municipality. It also prohibits contractors from receiving compensation based on the number of citations issued by the municipality or citations actually paid. We cannot predict whether additional pieces of legislation will be enacted, or the impact they may have on our business.
 Employees
  
  As of February 24, 2017, we employed 41 full-time employees. Employees related to ATSE and discontinued operations were 23 and 18 respectively. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements.  We anticipate hiring additional employees to ensure timely delivery of customer projects and services, as necessary. Additionally, we intend to use the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services, when appropriate. We believe that this use of third-party service providers may enhance our ability to contain general and administrative expenses.
