ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview 
 
The principal business of LSC Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (“LSC Communications,” “LSC,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” and “us”) is to offer a broad scope of traditional and digital print, print-related services and office products.  The Company serves the needs of publishers, merchandisers and retailers worldwide with a service offering that includes e-services, warehousing and fulfillment and supply chain management. The Company utilizes a broad portfolio of technology capabilities coupled with consultative attention to clients' needs to increase speed to market, reduce costs, provide postal savings to customers and improve efficiencies. The Company prints magazines, catalogs, retail inserts, books, and directories and its office products offerings include filing products, note-taking products, binders, tax and stock forms and envelopes.        
 
On October 1, 2016 (the “separation date”), R. R. Donnelley & Sons Company (“RRD” or the “Parent”) completed the previously announced separation (the “separation”) into three separate independent publicly-traded companies: (i) its publishing and retail-centric print services and office products business (“LSC Communications”); (ii) its financial communications services business (“Donnelley Financial Solutions, Inc.” or “Donnelley Financial”) and (iii) a global, customized multichannel communications management company, which is the business of RRD after the separation.  To effect the separation, RRD undertook a series of transactions to separate net assets and legal entities.  RRD completed the distribution (the “distribution”) of 80.75%, of the outstanding common stock of LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial to RRD shareholders on October 1, 2016.  RRD retained a 19.25% ownership stake in both LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial.  On October 1, 2016, RRD shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 23, 2016 received one share of LSC Communications common stock and one share of Donnelley Financial common stock for every eight shares of RRD common stock held as of the record date. As a result of the separation, LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial are now independent publicly-traded companies and began regular way trading under the symbols “LKSD” and “DFIN,” respectively, on the New York Stock Exchange on October 3, 2016.  RRD remains an independent publicly-traded company trading under the symbol “RRD” on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 
In connection with the separation, LSC Communications, RRD and Donnelley Financial entered into commercial arrangements and transition services agreements.  Under the terms of the commercial arrangements, RRD continues to provide, among other things, logistics, premedia, production and sales services to LSC Communications. RRD will also provide LSC Communications certain global outsourcing, technical support and other services. LSC Communications also continues to provide print and bind services for Donnelley Financial. In addition, LSC Communications continues to provide sales support services to RRD’s Asia and Mexico print and graphics management businesses in order to facilitate sales of books and related products to the U.S. 
 
Under the terms of the transition services agreements, RRD provides certain services to LSC Communications, including, but not limited to, in such areas as tax, information technology, treasury, internal audit, human resources, accounting, purchasing, communications, security and compensation and benefits.  These agreements facilitated the separation by allowing LSC Communications to operate independently prior to establishing stand-alone back office systems across its organization.  Transition services may be provided for up to twenty-four months following the separation.  LSC Communications provides certain services to RRD and Donnelley Financial including, but not limited to information technology and credit services.
 
The Company and RRD also entered into:  
 
 
• | A separation and distribution agreement (to which Donnelley Financial is also a party) which accomplished the distribution of LSC Communications’ common stock and the distribution of Donnelley Financial’s common stock to RRD’s common stockholders, and which governs the Company’s relationships with RRD and Donnelley Financial with respect to pre-separation matters and provides for the allocation of employee benefit, litigation and other liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to the separation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A Tax Disaffiliation Agreement that allocates responsibility for taxes between LSC Communications and RRD and includes indemnification rights with respect to tax matters and restrictions to preserve the tax-free status of the separation; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A Patent Assignment and License Agreement, a Trademark Assignment and License Agreement, a Data Assignment and License Agreement and a Software, Copyright and Trade Secret Assignment and License Agreement, in each case, that will provide for ownership, licensing and other arrangements to facilitate RRD’s, Donnelley Financial’s and the Company’s ongoing use of intellectual property, as applicable.

Business Overview
 
The Company serves the needs of publishers, merchandisers, cataloguers and retailers with product and service offerings that include traditional and digital print, e-services, warehousing, fulfillment and supply chain management services.  In addition, we manufacture and sell office products offerings that include filing products, note-taking products, binder products and tax and stock forms and envelopes.
Print Business
 
The product and service offerings in the Print business include:
 
Magazines, catalogs, and retail inserts: We are one of the largest producers of catalogs, magazines and retail inserts in North America. These products are produced to customers’ specifications using either offset or gravure printing processes in combination with either on-press finishing, saddle-stitch binding or patent binding. Our catalog customers include retailers and other direct-to-buyer sellers who design their own catalogs and use our production capabilities to print and distribute their catalogs to customers through the mail. Our magazine customers are magazine publishers who design their own magazines and use our production capabilities to print and distribute their magazines through the mail directly to their subscribers and through wholesalers to retailers and other “newsstands” for purchase by non-subscribers. Our retail insert customers include retailers who distribute their inserts in newspapers distributed to newspaper subscribers and via in-store distribution. In the U.S., we have a network of production facilities enabling the optimal combination of regional and national distribution. Additionally, we have production facilities in Poland and Mexico that efficiently produce products for international distribution.
Books: We are the largest producer of books in the U.S. Our book customers generally are book publishers who seek to print hardcover and softcover books, with either case, soft or spiral binding serving the education, trade, religious and testing sectors. We believe we are well positioned to meet our book customers’ specific needs, whether they be colors, page counts, trim size, binding styles or quantities. Consumer trade books are typically produced using either offset or digital printing processes, and are bound in a variety of formats. Educational books include softcover and traditional casebound textbooks utilized by primary and secondary school and college students, as well as workbooks, teachers’ editions, and other formats. 
Directories: We produce directories which are mainly phone directories that support local and small business advertising. Our customers for directory printing are generally marketing solution providers that publish online as well as printed directories. 
 
Print-related services: In addition to printed products, we provide a number of print-related services. Our supply chain management offering includes procurement, warehousing, distribution, and inventory management for book publishers. We also provide e-book formatting, and distribution services. Our mail services offering includes list processing, and mail sortation services that, combined with our production scale, optimize postal costs for magazine and catalog customers. Our primary mail sortation facility is located in Bolingbrook, Illinois. Because of our scale of production, we are frequently able to provide cross-customer sortation that reduces postal costs for our customers compared to what an individual customer could obtain.
 

Office Products Business
 
The Office Product business produces a wide range of branded and private label products, primarily within the following five categories:
 
Filing products: Our filing products include a variety of presentation and storage materials for professionals and students. We sell our filing products under the Pendaflex and other brands, as well as under private label brands for third parties. 
 
Note-taking products: Our note-taking products include legal pads, journals, index cards, spiral notebooks, composition books and notebook filler paper. We sell our note-taking products under the TOPS, Ampad, Oxford, and other brands, as well as under private label brands for third parties.

Forms: We produce business forms, tax forms, message and memo pads, financial forms, and recordkeeping materials for businesses within the U.S. Our key brand used for forms is Adams, and we also produce private label forms for third parties. 
 4



Envelopes: We produce envelopes for businesses within the U.S. Our key brand used for envelopes is Ampad, and we also produce private label envelopes for third parties. 
Segment Descriptions
 
The Company’s operating and reporting segments are aligned with how the chief operating decision maker of the Company currently manages the business.  The Company’s operating and reportable segments are summarized below:
Print
 
We are the largest producer of books in the U.S. and one of the largest producers of catalogs, magazines and retail inserts in North America. The Print segment produces magazines, catalogs, retail inserts, books, and directories. The segment also provides supply-chain management and certain other print-related services, including mail-list management and sortation, e-book formatting and distribution.  The segment has operations in the U.S., Europe and Mexico.  The Print segment is divided into the magazines, catalog and retail inserts, book, Europe and directories reporting units. The Print segment accounted for approximately 86% of the Company’s consolidated and combined net sales in 2016.
Office Products
 
The Office Products segment manufactures and sells branded and private label products in five core categories. The Office Products segment accounted for approximately 14% of the Company’s consolidated and combined net sales in 2016.
Corporate
 
Corporate consists of unallocated selling, general and administrative activities and associated expenses including, in part, executive, legal, finance, communications, certain facility costs and Last-in, First-out (“LIFO”) inventory provisions.  In addition, certain costs and earnings of employee benefit plans, such as pension benefit plan income and share-based compensation, are included in Corporate and not allocated to the operating segments. Prior to the separation, many of these costs were based on allocations from RRD; however, the Company has incurred such costs directly after the separation.   
 
Financial and other information related to these segments is included in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in Note 18, Segment Information, to the consolidated and combined financial statements. 
 

Business Acquisitions
 
On December 2, 2016, the Company acquired Continuum Management Company, LLC (“Continuum”), a print procurement and management business, for $7 million in cash.
 
On June 8, 2015, RRD acquired Courier Corporation (“Courier”), a leader in digital printing and publishing primarily in the United States that specializes in educational, religious and trade books, for $137 million in cash and 8 million shares of RRD common stock, for a total transaction value of $292 million.
 
On March 25, 2014, the Company acquired substantially all of the North American operations of Esselte Corporation (“Esselte”), a developer and manufacturer of nationally branded and private label office and stationery products, for $82 million in cash and 1 million shares of RRD common stock, or a total transaction value of $101 million.
 
For further information on the above acquisitions, refer to Note 3, Business Combination, to the consolidated and combined financial statements.

Competitive Environment
 
According to the November 2016 IBIS World industry report “Printing in the U.S.,” estimated total printing industry revenue was approximately $85 billion in 2016, of which approximately $15 billion relates to our core segments of the print market and an additional approximately $32 billion relates to related segments of the print market in which we are able to offer certain products. Despite consolidation in recent years, including several acquisitions completed by LSC, the industry remains highly fragmented and LSC is one of the largest players in our segment of the print market. The print and related services industry, in general, continues to have excess capacity and LSC remains diligent in proactively identifying plant consolidation opportunities to keep our capacity in line with demand. Across the Company’s range of Print segment products and services, competition is based primarily on the ability to deliver products for the lowest total cost, a factor driven not only by price, but also by materials and distribution costs. We expect that prices for print products and services will continue to be a focal point for customers in coming years.
 
Value-added services, such as LSC’s co-mail and supply chain management offerings, enable customers to lower their total costs. Technological changes, including the electronic distribution of documents and data, online distribution and hosting of media content, and advances in digital printing, print-on-demand and internet technologies, continue to impact the market for our products and services. The impact of digital technologies has been felt in many print products. Digital technologies have impacted printed magazines, as some advertising spending has moved from print to electronic media. In addition, catalogs and retail inserts have experienced volume reductions as our customers allocate more of their spending to online resources and also face stiff competition from online retailers resulting in retailer compression and store closures. Electronic communication and transaction technology has also continued to drive electronic substitution in directory printing, in part driven by cost pressures at key customers. E-book substitution has impacted overall consumer print trade book volume, although e-book adoption rates are stabilizing and industry-wide print book volume has been growing in recent years.  Educational books within the college market continue to be impacted by electronic substitution and other trends.  The K-12 market continues to be focused on increasing digital distribution but there has been inconsistent progress across school systems. 
 
The future impact of technology on our business is difficult to predict and could result in additional expenditures to restructure impacted operations or develop new technologies. In addition, we have made targeted acquisitions and investments in our existing business to offer customers innovative services and solutions. Such acquisitions and investments include the acquisition of Continuum in 2016, which expanded our print management capabilities; Courier Corporation in 2015, which expanded our book fulfillment and digital printing capabilities; and Esselte in 2014, which expanded our office products offerings. This and other targeted acquisitions and investments further secure our position as a technology leader in the industry.
 
Technological advancement and innovation has affected the overall demand for most of the products in our Office Products segment. While these changes continue to impact demand, the overall market for our products remains large and we believe share growth is attainable. We compete against a range of both domestic and international competitors in each of our product categories within the segment. Due to the increasing percentage of private label products in the market, resellers have created a highly competitive environment where purchasing decisions are based largely on price, quality and the supplier’s ability to service the customer. As consumer preferences shift towards private label, resellers have increased the pressure on suppliers to better differentiate their product offering, oftentimes through product exclusivity, product innovation and development of private label products.
 
LSC Communications has implemented a number of strategic initiatives to reduce its overall cost structure and improve efficiency, including the restructuring, reorganization and integration of operations and streamlining of administrative and support activities. Future cost reduction initiatives could include the reorganization of operations and the consolidation of facilities. Implementing such initiatives might result in future restructuring or impairment charges, which may be substantial.  Management also reviews LSC Communications’ operations and management structure on a regular basis to appropriately balance risks and opportunities to maximize efficiencies and to support the Company’s long-term strategic goals. 
 

Seasonality
 
Advertising and consumer spending trends affect demand in several of the end-markets served by LSC Communications. Historically, demand for printing of magazines, catalogs, retail inserts, books and office products is higher in the second half of the year, driven by increased advertising pages within magazines, holiday volume in catalogs and retail inserts, and back-to-school demand in books and office products. These typical seasonal patterns can be impacted by overall trends in the U.S. and world economy.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company experienced higher demand for its educational book products in the second quarter compared to normal historical patterns. Additionally, there was lower than normal demand in the fourth quarter for education books for the college market.

Raw Materials
 
The primary raw materials we use in our Print segment are paper and ink. We negotiate with leading paper suppliers to maximize our purchasing efficiencies and use a wide variety of paper grades and formats. In addition, a substantial amount of paper used in our print business is supplied directly by customers. Variations in the cost and supply of certain paper grades used in the manufacturing process may affect our consolidated and combined financial results. Generally, customers directly absorb the impact of changing prices on customer-supplied paper. For paper that we purchase, we have historically passed most changes in price through to our customers. Contractual arrangements and industry practice should support our continued ability to pass on any future paper price increases, but there is no assurance that market conditions will continue to enable us to successfully do so. Higher paper prices and tight paper supplies may have an impact on customers’ demand for printed products. We also resell waste paper and other print-related by-products and may be impacted by changes in prices for these by-products.
 
We negotiate with leading suppliers to maximize our purchasing efficiencies and use a wide variety of ink formulations and colors. Variations in the cost and supply of certain ink formulations used in the manufacturing process may affect our consolidated and combined financial results. We have undertaken various strategic initiatives to try to mitigate any foreseeable supply disruptions with respect to our ink requirements, including entering into a long term supply arrangement with a single supplier for a substantial portion of our ink supply. Certain contractual protections exist in our relationship with such supplier, such as price and quality protections and an ability to seek alternative sources of ink if the supplier breaches or is unable to perform certain of its obligations, which are intended to mitigate the risk of ink-related supply disruptions. 
 
The primary materials used in the Office Products segment are paper, steel and polypropylene substrates. We negotiate with leading paper, plastic and steel suppliers to maximize our purchasing efficiencies. All of these materials are available from a number of domestic and international suppliers and we are not dependent upon any single supplier for any of these materials. We believe that adequate supply is available for each of these materials for the foreseeable future.
 
Except for our long-term supply arrangement regarding ink, we do not consider ourselves to be dependent upon any single vendor as a source of supply for our businesses, and we believe that sufficient alternative sources for the same, similar or alternative products are available.
 
Changes in the price of crude oil and other energy costs impact our ink suppliers and manufacturing costs. Crude oil and energy prices continue to be volatile. Should prices increase, we generally cannot pass on to customers the impact of higher energy prices on our manufacturing costs. We do enter into fixed price contracts for a portion of our natural gas purchases to mitigate the impact of changes in energy prices. We cannot predict sudden changes in energy prices and the impact that possible future changes in energy prices might have upon either future operating costs or customer demand and the related impact either will have on the Company’s consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows.  
 
Variations in the cost and supply of certain paper grades, polypropylene and steel used in the manufacturing process of our office products may affect our consolidated and combined financial results. Contractual arrangements and industry practice should support our continued ability to pass on any future paper price increases, but there is no assurance that market conditions will continue to enable us to successfully do so. We also resell waste paper and other by-products and may be impacted by changes in prices for these by-products.
 

Customers
 
Our Print segment services retailers, including catalogers and merchandisers; and publishers of magazines, books and directories and online retailers. Our customer base includes nine of the top ten direct mail catalogers, nine of the top ten magazine publishers, and all of the top ten book publishers based in North America and Europe, including the two largest book publishers worldwide in 2016.  The products that make up our Print segment are distributed through the United States Postal Service (“USPS”)  or foreign postal services or to our customers by direct shipment, typically in bulk, to customer facilities and warehouses.
 
Our Office Products segment primarily services office superstores, office supply wholesalers, independent contract stationers, mass merchandisers and retailers and e-commerce resellers. The products that make up our Office Products segment are distributed to our customers by direct shipment, typically in bulk, to customer facilities and warehouses.
 
For each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated and combined net sales.

Technology, Research and Development
 The Company has a broad portfolio of technology capabilities that are utilized in the delivery of products and services to our customers. We believe that proprietary technology is required where it will provide a competitive advantage or where the desired technology is not readily available in the marketplace, and, as such, our proprietary technology portfolio contains an array of applications and technological capabilities that were developed to perform different functions, including storefront, digital asset management and distribution, manufacturing systems, warehousing, logistics and list management services and data analytics solutions. Our technology strategy is focused on the continued investment in key technologies that support services and solutions that allow for creation, management, production, distribution and analytics of publisher content in multi-channels to maximize their distribution and return for each title. We are also focusing our technology capabilities on developments that will allow us to pursue strategic relationships, such as our recent relationship with a leading education, business and consumer publishing company, which has enabled our further expansion into end-to-end supply chain management. To implement our research and development strategy, we expect to primarily invest in the maintenance and enhancement of our technology footprint within our facilities and in development activities which allow us to create new and differentiating technology capabilities.
Cybersecurity
 Our cybersecurity program is designed to meet the needs and expectations of our customers who entrust us with certain sensitive business information. Our infrastructure and technology, expansive and highly trained workforce and comprehensive security and compliance program make us qualified to safely process, store and protect this customer information. 
 Our infrastructure and technology security capabilities are bolstered by our relationship with a leading data center services provider. Furthermore, our networks are monitored by intrusion detection services around the clock, and our systems and applications are routinely tested for vulnerabilities and are operated under a strict patch management program.
 We employ a highly skilled IT workforce to implement our cybersecurity programs and to handle specific security responsibilities. As a result of annual mandatory security awareness training, our IT workforce is qualified to address security and compliance-related issues as they arise. Additionally, all of our IT employees are carefully screened, undergo a thorough background check and are bound by a nondisclosure agreement that details such employee’s security and legal responsibilities with regards to information handling. We believe our security and compliance team also diminishes the risk of system compromise and data exposure by rapidly and effectively addressing security incidents as they arise.
 Intellectual Property
 We consider patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights to be important to our business. We own approximately 190 patents worldwide, the majority of which are concentrated in our Office Products segment, with the remainder falling into the following categories: printing, binding, co-mailing, and new media. Our printing and binding patents relate to manufacturing processes and systems used in the production of books, magazines and catalogs. Our co-mailing patents relate to combining printed publications in an efficient manner to achieve postal savings. Our new media patents relate to methods for creating and formatting digital content for electronic publications. Lastly, our office products patents include utility and design patents covering a range of office products such as binders, envelopes, file folders, index tab systems and storage boxes. In addition, we benefit from a patented ink formulation developed by RRD that we use in manufacturing digitally-printed books. RRD will continue to supply this ink to us.
 We also own approximately 400 trademarks worldwide, the majority of which are concentrated within our Office Products segment. Several of our most significant trademarks include registrations for the Adams, Ampad, Cardinal Brands, Oxford, Pendaflex and TOPS office products brands. Additionally, we own the rights to a group of trademarks relating to our e-media publishing services, such as Newsstand, LibreDigital, LibreMarket, LibrePublish, and LibreAccess.
 While we consider our patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights to be valuable assets, we do not believe that our profitability and operations are dependent upon any single patent, trademark or other proprietary right.
 Environmental Compliance
 Our operations are subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges to air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous materials, the cleanup of contaminated sites and health and safety matters. In the United States, these laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and Superfund (the environmental program established in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act to address abandoned hazardous waste sites), which imposes joint and severable liability on each potentially responsible party. We are committed to complying with these and all other applicable environmental, health, and safety laws, and in order to reduce the risk of non-compliance, we maintain an Environmental, Health and Safety management system that includes an appropriate policy and standards, staff dedicated to environmental, health, and safety issues, and other measures. 
 8


While it is our policy to conduct our global operations in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and other requirements, from time to time, our properties, products or operations may be affected by environmental issues. It is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that we may undertake in the future. However, in the opinion of management, compliance with the present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated and combined financial statements. 
 

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately 22,000 total employees in the global workforce, of which approximately 17,000 employees were in the U.S. and approximately 5,000 were in international locations.  Of the U.S. and international employees, approximately 4.0% and 30.0% were covered by collective bargaining agreements, respectively. We have collective bargaining agreements with unionized employees in Canada, Mexico and Poland. We have not experienced a work stoppage during the past five years. Management believes that we have good relationships with our employees and collective bargaining groups.
