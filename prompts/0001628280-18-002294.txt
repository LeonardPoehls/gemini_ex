Item 1. Business.
On October 9, 2015, the Company and its assets and operations were acquired by LSF9 Cypress Parent, LLC now known as FBM Alpha LLC through a newly formed company, LSF9 Cypress Holdings, LLC now known as Foundation Building Materials Holding Company LLC, which we refer to as the Lone Star Acquisition. Unless otherwise specified, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to "we," "our," "us" and "the Company" refer to (i) for the predecessor periods prior to the completion of the Lone Star Acquisition, the business of FBM Intermediate Holdings, LLC, (ii) for the successor periods after completion of the Lone Star Acquisition, but prior to the internal reorganization transaction in which the business was transferred to Foundation Building Materials, Inc., the business of Foundation Building Materials Holding Company LLC and its subsidiaries and (iii) for the successor periods after completion of the internal reorganization transaction, the business of Foundation Building Materials, Inc., in each case together with its consolidated subsidiaries. 
Our Company 
We are the second largest specialty distributor of wallboard and suspended ceiling systems in the United States and Canada, and the fastest growing by sales and branch count since our founding in 2011. We are also the second largest specialty distributor and one of the largest fabricators of commercial and industrial mechanical insulation in the United States. We have expanded from a single branch in Southern California to more than 220 branches across the United States and Canada as of December 31, 2017, carrying a broad array of more than 35,000 SKUs. Our organic growth initiatives and disciplined acquisition strategy have enabled us to grow rapidly. Our net sales in 2013 were $113.7 million and we reached net sales of $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our goal is to be the leading company within specialty building products distribution and to continue expanding into complementary markets. 
We serve as a critical link between our supplier base and a diverse and highly fragmented set of more than 28,000 customers. Our specialty building products segment, which distributes wallboard, metal framing, suspended ceiling systems and complementary and other products, accounted for approximately 86.9% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. Within the specialty building products segment, we distribute products to contractors who install them in commercial and residential buildings for both new construction and repair and remodeling projects. Our mechanical insulation segment, which distributes commercial and industrial insulation products to provide insulation solutions for pipes and mechanical systems, accounted for approximately 13.1% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. We fabricate and distribute these products for specialty contractors seeking to improve or maintain energy efficiency in a diverse range of commercial and industrial buildings. Our customers use these products in maintenance, repair and operations, or MRO, and new construction. In the year ended December 31, 2016, 92.9% and 7.1% of our net sales were derived from our specialty building products segment and our mechanical insulation segment, respectively. For the periods from October 9, 2015 to December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 to October 8, 2015, 100% of net sales were derived from our specialty building products segment because we had not yet entered into the mechanical insulation segment.
We have an expansive branch network that serves attractive markets across the United States and Canada. The ability to leverage our branches, together with our organic growth initiatives and disciplined acquisition strategy, has allowed us to drive share gains in the specialty building products distribution market.
We believe that our customers select and trust us because we have the expertise to efficiently and effectively handle and deliver a broad product offering, including wallboard, metal framing, suspended ceiling systems, commercial and industrial insulation and complementary and other products, and to manage the complex logistics required to safely deliver and stock the right products to the appropriate locations at each jobsite. It is critical for our contractor customers to have the correct product, when they need it, in order to complete their projects on time and on budget without costly delays. We also provide our customers with technical product expertise, including proper installation techniques for new products. We typically deliver wallboard and other products directly to the floor where it will be installed, from the first floor to the penthouse of a major high rise. For ceiling contractors, we carry a wide range of products and have the technical sales expertise to assist our customers in selecting the appropriate acoustical product for their project. For our commercial and industrial insulation customers, we fabricate the insulation into specific shapes and sizes prior to delivery rather than on site depending on its ultimate application, thereby decreasing our customers’ labor costs. Our North American scale gives us the ability to serve contractors and homebuilders that operate across multiple geographic markets. Most of our customer accounts are managed by salespeople and managers who communicate with customers on a regular basis and, as a result, have developed longstanding and trusted relationships.

We have close relationships with our suppliers at both the executive and local branch level. We believe we are a preferred distributor for our suppliers due to our scale, nationwide footprint, leading market positions, knowledgeable professionals, high service levels and strong relationships with a broad set of contractor customers. We also believe our suppliers seek our business because we are one of the highest growth distributors in our industry and have a demonstrated ability to achieve above market growth. In suspended ceiling systems, we have exclusive distribution relationships in select geographies for certain products. These relationships include contractual exclusivity with Armstrong World Industries, Inc., or Armstrong, and relationship-based exclusivity with USG Corporation, or USG. Armstrong has supported our expansion by renewing our contractual exclusivity or extending our contractual exclusivity into additional territories after we acquired certain companies. This contractual exclusivity makes us the sole distributor carrying Armstrong products in certain markets. We also possess semi-exclusive distribution rights in other markets. 
We serve a balanced mix of end markets across the new non-residential construction, new residential construction and non-residential repair and remodel sectors. Our products are used in the construction and repair and remodel of new commercial buildings, single-family, multi-family homes and industrial facilities. We believe activity in the new construction end markets will continue to grow, since new non-residential activity and residential housing starts in the United States remain below historical averages. Our products are used for the maintenance, repair and remodel of existing structures, including industrial MRO, which we believe provides a stable source of sales across economic cycles. 
The table below summarizes our major product categories, applications and end markets.

We were founded in 2011 by our President and Chief Executive Officer Ruben Mendoza, our Chief Financial Officer John Gorey and one of our Regional Vice Presidents, Tom Fischbeck. Mr. Mendoza previously served as CEO of Acoustical Material Services where he oversaw the successful growth of the company before it was acquired by Allied Building Products in 2007. In founding our company, Mr. Mendoza applied a proven customer-centric operating model to an organization that would combine strong organic growth with an effective acquisition and integration program across a fragmented industry. In November 2013, we strengthened our management team with the addition of our Chief Operating Officer, Pete Welly, who has over 35 years of experience in our industry. Other members of our management team have spent the majority of their careers in the wallboard and suspended ceiling systems distribution industry. As a result of long and close personal relationships with many of the private owners of wallboard and suspended ceiling systems distributors, our acquisitions generally have been completed on a privately negotiated, non-auction basis. Since 2013, the majority of senior level leaders who have sold us their businesses have elected to stay on as active employees and are often our best references to owners considering a sale to us.
On October 9, 2015, 100% of the outstanding equity of FBM Intermediate Holdings LLC was acquired by investment funds, or affiliates of investment funds, advised, managed or controlled by Lone Star Fund IX (U.S.) L. P., which we refer to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K together with certain of its affiliates and associates (excluding us and other companies it owns as a result of its investment activities), as Lone Star, along with certain members of management for approximately $560.0 million. 
Our acquisition activity is described in greater detail in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
Our Competitive Strengths 
Market leader with significant size and scale advantages
Our coast-to-coast footprint enables us to distribute our comprehensive product offering to a large, diverse set of customers and provides us with significant economies of scale that we believe give us cost advantages versus our smaller competitors. As a leading specialty building products distributor, we are able to negotiate volume discounts and preferential pricing terms with our key suppliers. As we continue to grow, we believe we will realize additional cost savings and other benefits from scale. Smaller competitors generally lack the resources to properly handle the logistical complexities of large scale specialty building products distribution. We have also been able to realize procurement discounts on our large fleet of over 3,000 vehicles, and we leverage this fleet to realize operational cost advantages from economies of scale. Additionally, our local market scale adds route density, which increases our profit margins. We believe our consolidated information technology systems and centralized administrative functions, which are shared nationally across our platform, generate additional operating cost efficiencies. 
Proven operating model 
We believe that our national operating model supported by local market expertise, entrepreneurial and customer centric-culture, acquisition and integration expertise and strong national brand has established us as the distributor of choice for leading suppliers and over 28,000 customers across a balanced mix of construction-related end markets. Our management team originally utilized elements of this operating model while overseeing prior companies and has applied those elements to us. Since our inception, we have invested heavily in identifying, recruiting, training and retaining highly dedicated employees. We invest in ongoing talent development and focus on rewarding performance based on profitability goals instead of pursuing sales growth at the expense of profit margins. 
Our technology infrastructure and "One Company" platform allows us to manage our information technology efficiently. We have established a broad, integrated business platform that allows our branch network to leverage a centralized ERP system and other back office support functions to minimize costs, while retaining important and timely decision making authority at the local level where we conduct business with our customers and can tailor our service and product offerings to their needs. This autonomy at the local level has fostered our entrepreneurial culture, while our national infrastructure support allows employees to focus on customer-first solutions.

Local market excellence 
We are a North American company focused on supplying the local building material needs of each geographical area we cover according to climate, building codes, customer preference and other considerations. We believe that we are able to maintain our local market excellence due to our longstanding customer and supplier relationships in local regions, dependable customer service, brand recognition and market-specific product offerings that cater to local trends and preferences. We actively track local and regional construction opportunities for our customers to help drive business for both them and ourselves, and our senior executives complement the local sales efforts by maintaining key relationships with major national and regional accounts. We seek to cultivate an entrepreneurial culture and empower branch managers with the independence and authority to make important business decisions locally under the Foundation Building Materials, or FBM, brand. We believe that this attracts highly dedicated employees who endeavor to provide our customers with dependable customer service that differentiates us from our competition. Our goal is to be the distributor of choice for our customers in all of the local markets we serve.
Strong customer relationships 
We sell to a diverse and highly fragmented base of over 28,000 customers, including commercial, residential and other specialty contractors. In addition to local contractors, we maintain strong regional relationships with regional non-residential construction companies and leading national homebuilders. Most customer accounts are serviced by managers and salespeople who communicate regularly with these accounts and have developed meaningful relationships built over many years. We believe customer loyalty has been built through our high-quality customer service and technical support, strong logistics capabilities, trade credit offerings, exclusive relationships to key suppliers in critical markets and product expertise across our comprehensive selection of premier products and brands. We are able to safely and efficiently deliver products to our customers at the right time and in the specified place. Based on our customer surveys, contractors often prioritize on-time delivery over price as they consider the negative repercussions that project delays create, particularly increased labor costs. We have an integrated delivery, dispatch and order tracking system that allows us to optimize routes and dispatch efficiencies. Optimization of delivery and dispatch results in lower costs for both delivery and fleet management. Additionally, for many of our products, we facilitate purchasing relationships between suppliers and our highly fragmented customer base by providing technical product knowledge, educating contractors on proper installation techniques for new products, enabling local product availability and extending trade credit. 
Longstanding relationships with leading suppliers 
We maintain longstanding relationships with a base of over 4,000 suppliers for whom we provide a direct channel to a large, diverse customer base across our national footprint. We are one of the largest customers for several of our top suppliers across the wallboard, suspended ceiling systems and metal framing product categories. We believe that suppliers find our scale, rapid growth, nationwide footprint, leading market positions, knowledgeable professionals, quality customer service and strong relationships with a broad set of contractors attractive. All key supplier relationships are led by our executive management team to foster long-term growth and maximize national pricing programs. We have access to leading brands and maintain exclusive distribution relationships to sell key products, such as suspended ceiling systems, in selected markets. Interior contractors often purchase wallboard and suspended ceiling systems from the same distributor, and carrying a ceilings product line helps to drive sales of wallboard and complementary products. We believe that our suppliers view us as a key facilitator to market and grow their businesses. We regularly discuss both acquisitions and greenfield expansion with our key suppliers, who may proactively recommend expansion opportunities to us.

Demonstrated ability to identify, execute and integrate acquisitions 
Our management team has built the Company from a single branch in 2011 into one of the leading specialty building products distributors in the United States and Canada. Since 2013, we have completed 28 acquisitions and believe that the large, highly fragmented nature of our market and our reputation throughout the industry provides us access to a robust acquisition pipeline at attractive valuations that will continue to supplement our strong, organic growth. Our acquisitions generally have been initiated through our senior management team’s business relationships developed over their many years in the industry, and we believe we have become a buyer of choice for owners of specialty distribution companies because we offer them the opportunity to gain liquidity while remaining involved in the active management of their business going forward. We generally avoid auction processes, and we believe we are often the only buyer involved in advanced discussions with these companies. This has led to a substantial pipeline of potential acquisition candidates that management is continuously cultivating. We have dedicated integration leaders who work closely with acquired branch personnel to unify acquisitions under a single brand with a common ERP system. We consolidate our acquired companies’ purchasing into our supplier purchasing programs, which generally have had more advantageous terms due to our greater scale. Our objective is to integrate each acquired company into our back office accounting, human resources and IT systems as quickly as possible after closing, with many transitioning to some of our systems on day one and most fully transitioning within 90 days of closing. Post-acquisition, we transition acquired companies exclusively to the FBM brand, and we have typically achieved additional remaining cost savings from the elimination of redundant overhead costs and branch consolidations. Our acquisitions have historically realized purchasing synergies almost immediately by taking advantage of our volume discounts.
Since 2013, many of the owners and senior management of companies that we have acquired have elected to remain employed with us post-acquisition and many invested in our majority shareholder prior to our initial public offering, which has proven to be successful in aligning incentives and ensuring smooth transitions. Currently, over 100 former owners, managers and employees of acquired businesses have an equity interest in our majority shareholder and remain engaged in the successful operation of our business. 
Experienced management team with strong track record of growth 
Our management team, including our senior management and vice presidents, collectively have an average of over 25 years of industry experience. Our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer Ruben Mendoza, is an accomplished leader with over 25 years of industry experience. Our Chief Financial Officer John Gorey brings over 30 years of industry experience, our Chief Operating Officer Pete Welly brings over 35 years of industry experience to the oversight of our operations and our Senior Vice President of Sales & Marketing Kirby Thompson has been working in the industry for over 35 years. By fostering an entrepreneurial and customer-centric culture and a proven ability to quickly and effectively integrate acquisitions under a common brand, this team has built the Company from a single branch into one of the leading specialty building products distributors in the United States and Canada. 
Our Business Strategy 
Our objective is to strengthen our competitive position, achieve profitable growth that exceeds market rates and increase shareholder value through the following key strategies: 
Continue to drive organic growth through strategic initiatives
We believe there are significant opportunities to continue to expand our existing geographic footprint by opening greenfield branches, expand our product offerings to existing customers, target new customers and expand our mechanical insulation platform. 

• | Expand product offerings across all branches. Our management team has identified opportunities in several of our regions for product line growth and expansion. We offer a number of products that are complementary to our wallboard sales including tools, fasteners and wallboard accessories, building insulation, exterior insulation finishing systems, stucco, plaster and fiberglass reinforced panels. These products typically generate higher profit margins than our core product offerings, and we believe there is opportunity for additional expansion of our complementary product sales. We monitor sales of our complementary products and look for opportunities to introduce new products across our entire network that have been successful in a subset of our branches.

• | Target new customers and increasing share with existing customers. We believe our scale and supplier relationships allow us to more efficiently offer a full suite of products than many of our competitors. We believe these advantages help us win new customers, and we have a proven track record of growing customer relationships and expanding wallboard market share. We plan to continue this growth by leveraging our experienced and driven sales force of more than 320 field sales personnel who develop new customer relationships at the local level. We also believe our product breadth, extensive operating experience, technical knowledge and specialized delivery fleet will allow us to continue to capture new customers and expand our sales to those customers over time. We have released a mobile application that allows our customers to easily access critical information, such as order and delivery status. 


• | Grow by selectively opening new branches. We believe that significant opportunities exist to continue to expand our geographic footprint by opening new branches that are adjacent to our existing operations. A greenfield branch has historically required approximately $0.6 million in capital expenditures and working capital to open and typically generates positive cash flow within one year. Key steps in the greenfield process include identifying growth markets where current customers or suppliers have identified a market need that we can support, conducting a market assessment, determining branch staffing and sales force and developing a comprehensive forecast to determine if the location can meet profitability targets. In 2017, we opened 3 greenfield branches and, in 2018, we plan to open four to seven greenfield branches. 


• | Expand the mechanical insulation platform. Through the acquisition of the Construction Products Distribution business division of Superior Plus Corp, or Winroc-SPI, we gained exposure to the mechanical insulation distribution market in North America. The mechanical insulation distribution market has experienced several macroeconomic trends in recent years that are favorable to our business, including stable distribution channels, distributor consolidation and stringent codes and regulations demanding more efficient processes and energy performance. Additionally, because mechanical insulation also targets the industrial end market, we believe this business can offer greater diversification and cyclical stability to our existing platform. 

In the mechanical insulation segment, we are actively pursuing growth opportunities to further expand our operational footprint and drive financial results. Opportunities such as product line expansion, acquisitions and new branches will allow us to expand our volumes and market share, enhancing the growth expected from the broader market expansion. 
Continue to expand and strengthen existing relationships with key suppliers

We believe our established relationships with market-leading suppliers serve as a key competitive advantage and support continued volume growth and purchasing power. Our suppliers benefit from our position as a single point of contact to over 28,000 customers and our ability as a partner to market and introduce new products efficiently and on a national scale. We maintain exclusive and semi-exclusive distribution rights in certain key markets. By expanding these relationships with suppliers, whether by adding more exclusive products or expanding exclusivity into new regions, we believe we will be able to further accelerate our growth. Additionally, our suppliers are critical partners in our growth, and we regularly discuss greenfield candidates with them, with suppliers sometimes proactively identifying expansion opportunities.
Enhance financial performance through improved operational efficiencies
We believe we have the potential for continued operating margin improvement through operational initiatives including optimizing pricing, improving fleet utilization, maximizing working capital efficiency from inventory and accounts receivable management, and strategic procurement processes. In addition, as our end markets continue to grow, we expect to generate higher operating margins on incremental volume as we leverage our fixed costs across our existing branch footprint. 
We strive to continuously improve our operational efficiency, and are currently pursuing a number of initiatives to drive operating margin expansion, including efforts to: 

• | Monitor critical daily metrics to improve branch efficiencies, including overtime, revenue per truck and revenue per employee;


• | Leverage the "Track My Truck" feature on the new FBM mobile application to provide real time delivery status for customer deliveries;


• | Use our GPS truck tracking system throughout our company to reduce fleet costs, improve route planning and provide required electronic driver logs; and


• | Leverage our increased investment in electronic data interchange to improve efficiency for both the purchasing and accounts payable teams.

To further drive operational efficiencies, we unify all of our completed acquisitions under a single brand and a common ERP system. Our information technology systems are scalable and coordinated, which gives us operational efficiencies through the sharing of best practices and information across this common platform. We believe our information technology infrastructure allows for effective, data-driven management and is built to empower local decision-making and enhance visibility across our branch network. 
We incentivize our branch managers and customer-facing branch-level employees based on branch-level operating income, which we believe leads to improved branch-level performance. 
Continue to be a leading industry consolidator
From 2013 through the end of 2017, our management team has identified and closed 28 acquisitions. We have successfully integrated all 28 of these acquisitions. We believe our national footprint, market leadership, entrepreneurial culture and ability to retain key leadership makes us an attractive buyer. We are generally selective and pursue acquisitions that both expand our footprint and generate synergies. We have a dedicated team of professionals to manage the acquisition and integration process. Due to the large and highly fragmented nature of our market and our reputation throughout the industry, we believe that we have access to a robust acquisition pipeline at attractive valuations that will continue to supplement our organic growth. We will also consider expansion into complementary specialty distribution markets through acquisitions. 
Focus on culture and continuous improvement
We believe that our employees are one of the key drivers of our success, and we intend to continue to recruit, train, promote and retain entrepreneurial and successful people. We believe that we have created a culture where our people feel valued and supported and see that their efforts are instrumental to our continued success. We are focused on providing our employees with regular training and development to improve customer service, workplace safety and job satisfaction. We implemented "FBM University" to provide our employees with extensive training and development programs, utilizing new learning management systems and in-person training programs, which we view as essential for new hires and the development of existing employees. We also selected and implemented a new Learning Management System or LMS that is user friendly, easily modified, fully compatible with our other existing programs and systems, and extremely cost effective. We also invested substantially in leadership training and team building through our annual "Key Leaders Summit" meeting. By improving our employees’ knowledge base and sharing best practices, we are able to empower our people at the branch-level to better serve local customers. 
Commitment to safety
Our commitment to safety is one of our core foundational values. This effort begins immediately with new employees through a comprehensive onboarding orientation that focuses on safety awareness, risk identification and other essential safety protocols. Training is delivered through a variety of media, including online modules and classroom settings, so that managers can employ the method that fits the employee’s needs.

Our Products 
We are a leading specialty distributor of a diversified mix of building products, including wallboard, suspended ceiling systems, metal framing, commercial and industrial insulation and complementary and other products. We are one of the two largest wallboard and suspended ceiling systems distributors in the United States and Canada based on our 2017 net sales. We provide customers with a comprehensive product offering, with over 35,000 SKUs. Our product breadth, combined with our commitment to quality customer service, has solidified our position as a supplier of choice. Our diversified product offering provides balanced exposure to several construction end markets that are growing. 
Wallboard 
We specialize in the distribution of high-quality wallboard used to finish the interior walls and ceilings in residential and commercial construction projects. Wallboard is used in the vast majority of new construction and renovation projects due to its ease of installation and superior performance in providing comfort, fire resistance, thermal and sound insulation, mold and moisture resistance, impact resistance and aesthetic and design elements. It is available in a number of standard lengths, widths and thicknesses with a range of characteristics. Panels with greater thickness provide increased durability and sound insulation. In non-residential construction projects, architectural specifications and building codes provide requirements related to the thickness of the panels and, in some cases, other characteristics, such as fire, mold and moisture resistance. Wallboard is an essential building product, with approximately 8,000 square feet of wallboard used on average in each new home. Given the importance of wallboard to the overall building process, contractors have very precise delivery expectations which are best met by experienced specialty building products distributors with a local presence and specialized equipment. 
Suspended ceiling systems
Suspended ceiling systems and grid help ensure and enhance the integrity, protection and decorative finishing of interior spaces. Ceilings consist of a higher number of specialized SKUs and less product standardization than the wallboard market. We believe ceiling product availability often pulls in additional business to our branches, as contractors often look to source additional interior products from a single distributor. The ceilings industry has enjoyed price stability through various cycles. Commoditization risk is limited as customers often seek specific design and aesthetic characteristics unique to their space. The market is characterized by high manufacturer concentration. Ceilings are sold into both non-residential repair and remodel and new non-residential construction markets.
We maintain exclusive distribution rights in certain markets with Armstrong, the leading manufacturer of suspended ceiling systems in the United States and Canada. Armstrong’s products are highly sought after by designers, contractors, builders and distributors. We have exclusive distribution rights for Armstrong ceilings in multiple markets across seven states and six Canadian provinces and non-exclusive distribution rights with Armstrong in multiple markets across twenty-five states and two other Canadian provinces. Armstrong closely oversees the marketing of its products, leading to its preference for granting distribution rights to only one or two companies in a given market. In addition, we have relationship-based exclusivity with USG in select markets in three states and non-exclusive relationships with USG in select markets across two states. 
Metal framing 
We provide metal framing and other framing products for multiple uses, including interior partitions and load bearing walls. We source our products from local, regional and national manufacturers in accordance with building standards and codes. Commercial contractors typically purchase these materials with wallboard, suspended ceiling systems, building insulation and other related building products from us as part of a commercial package. 
Commercial and industrial insulation and non-industrial insulation
We distribute and fabricate commercial and industrial insulation products through 65 branches in the United States and Canada as of December 31, 2017. Commercial and industrial insulation products are marketed on a wholesale basis to insulation contractors, HVAC contractors, general contractors and to operators of large industrial facilities. Commercial and industrial insulation products are used to protect and insulate HVAC systems and piping and equipment systems for commercial buildings, metal buildings and industrial facilities. Other commercial and industrial insulation products include fire protection and wall and ceiling specialty products. Across our commercial and industrial insulation distribution network, we provide insulation fabrication services that customize products to fit specific systems. We believe our customers value our fabrication capabilities and quality as well as the labor savings they create. Fabrication provides significant value to our customers and ensures significant pull-through sales.
10


Complementary and other products 
We offer complementary and other products, tools and accessories such as wallboard accessories, stucco and exterior insulation and finishing systems, building insulation, safety accessories, fasteners, doors and roofing products. Certain products are provided on a regional basis to address local preferences. These complementary products allow us to provide a full suite of products across our entire business, enhancing our margins and creating value for our customers. 
 Wallboard accessories are generally sold as a package in conjunction with wallboard and include most products used for the installation and finishing of wallboard. Key wallboard accessories include joint compounds, trims, tapes and various other accessories.
Customers and Suppliers 
Customers 
We sell to a diverse and highly fragmented base of over 28,000 customers, including commercial, residential and other specialty contractors. In addition to local contractors, we maintain strong relationships with regional construction companies and leading national homebuilders. Most customer accounts are serviced by managers and salespeople who communicate regularly with these accounts and have developed meaningful relationships built over many years. During the year ended December 31, 2017, there were no customers that exceeded 10% of net sales.
Suppliers 
We maintain longstanding relationships with a base of over 4,000 suppliers, with no single supplier accounting for more than approximately 14% of our purchases for the year ended December 31, 2017. We are one of the largest customers for several of our top suppliers across wallboard, suspended ceiling systems and metal framing. We believe that suppliers find our scale, rapid growth, nationwide footprint, leading market positions, knowledgeable professionals, quality customer service and strong relationships with a broad set of contractors attractive. We have strong relationships with leading wallboard, suspended ceiling systems and metal framing manufacturers and we are able to provide them with a direct channel to a large, diverse customer base and a national footprint. In addition, the Winroc-SPI acquisition in August 2016 brought us long-term relationships with commercial and industrial insulation product manufacturers and access to all product lines within their distribution and custom fabrication network. 
Sales and Marketing 
We utilize a sales strategy that enables our sales force to develop strong customer relationships at the local level. The sales effort is managed by sales or branch managers and executed by both inside and outside sales teams. Due to the service-oriented and relationship-driven nature of the sales process, it is important to have experienced teams in each local market. To ensure customer expectations are met, our sales teams include both product sales specialists and sales managers who focus on specific products, categories and regions. We also tailor our sales approach to best suit customer needs within each end market. Both the commercial and residential sales processes are largely relationship-driven, although the commercial sales process is also highly technical and requires product knowledge with a sophisticated material delivery plan.
We employ both inside sales and field sales personnel. Inside sales personnel primarily service customers at the branches, by phone or email, while field sales personnel primarily sell to customers face-to-face. These representatives are responsible for driving new customer sales and maintaining as well as growing existing customer relationships. Our executives complement the local sales efforts by continuing to maintain key relationships with major national and regional accounts while sharing their significant experience with various sales organizations and reinforcing a customer-centric philosophy. We also coordinate closely with our major suppliers to optimize specific sales strategies. In addition to providing customer relationship support, our executive team also coordinates the go-to-market strategy and provides ongoing job and product training.  Given the importance of strong local relationships, we thoroughly vet the strength of an acquisition target’s long-term customer relationships. Our management views these local relationships and the sales team of any acquired company to be critical to a successful integration. 
11


We employ various marketing strategies to reach our customers in the most efficient and effective manner. We market our products and services through our website, mobile app, sample kits, advertisement materials and trade shows. Employees are encouraged to participate in industry associations as another point of customer connectivity.  Certain employees are members and have served as officers and directors of numerous industry associations, including the Association of the Wall and Ceiling Industry, Ceilings & Interior Systems Construction Association, EIFS Industry Members Association and selected other regional associations. Furthermore, we sponsor a number of annual conventions and trade shows. Management believes that some of our most effective marketing is "word-of-mouth" given our reputation for high-quality products, superior customer service and product expertise and stellar delivery performance. We also benefit from the marketing and brand strength of several key suppliers, especially those with whom we hold exclusive arrangements.

Employees 
As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 3,782 employees, 175 of whom were unionized. We enjoy a strong relationship with our employees, including our unionized employees. We have not experienced a work stoppage, and we currently have no ongoing labor disputes.
Health and Safety 
We approach health and safety through an operationally driven safety program utilizing a common approach encouraging the sharing of best practices across the specialty building products distribution, mechanical insulation and fabrication businesses. Our safety resources have an operational background and work closely with all levels of management on developing and managing our company-wide safety program. We have a strong management commitment in place from the CEO and COO through the branch operating level. We have a clearly defined safety structure that includes dedicated Regional Safety Coordinators to drive harmonization of safety protocols across the entire branch network. The Regional Safety Coordinators support branch Safety Champions whose duties are integrated as a shared responsibility within their operations role. Through branch ownership of the safety program, the Safety Champion works with their local management and Regional Safety Coordinator on day-to-day safety issues including incident reporting and investigation, inspections and training needs. Through our internal protocols and safety training programs, we strive to be an industry leader in developing and promoting a strong safety culture. The effort begins immediately with new employees through a comprehensive orientation that focuses on safety awareness, risk identification, hazard communication and other essential safety protocols. We deliver training through a variety of media, including online modules, hands on training and classroom settings. Our employees share the responsibility to work in a manner that safeguards themselves, their coworkers and the communities they serve. We work diligently with our employees and continually advocate adherence to the highest safety standards. Management’s expectations and policy toward safety is clearly communicated and is supported by our "Safety Absolutes," which are key rules that all of our employees are required to follow.
Competition
 We compete primarily against other specialty building product distributors as well as big box retailers and lumberyards. Among specialty building products distributors, we compete against a small number of large national distributors and many small, local, privately-owned distributors. Of the four large national wallboard distributors in our industry, we are one of two active consolidators. Our remaining competitors are generally smaller regional and local firms, many of which we view as attractive acquisition opportunities. The principal competitive factors in our business include, but are not limited to, availability of materials and supplies; technical product knowledge and expertise; advisory or other service capabilities; timely and comprehensive delivery capabilities; pricing of products; and availability of credit.
Seasonality 
Use and consumption of our products fluctuate due to seasonality. Nearly all of the products we sell and our customers use are exposed to outdoor elements during delivery or installation. Therefore, seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions, in particular extended rainy and cold weather in the spring and fall and major weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms and heavy snows, can adversely affect our business and operations. Our shipment levels also follow activity in the construction industry, which typically increases in the more moderate seasons of spring, summer and fall.
