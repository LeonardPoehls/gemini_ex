 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 Except as otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, “KLX,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to KLX Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries after giving effect to the internal reorganization and its spin‑off from B/E Aerospace, and “B/E Aerospace” refers to B/E Aerospace, Inc., its predecessors and its consolidated subsidiaries, other than, for all periods following the spin‑off, KLX Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—The Spin‑off.” Our Company
 We believe, based on our experience in the industry, that we are one of the world’s leading independent distributors and value‑added service providers of aerospace fasteners and consumables, and that we offer one of the broadest ranges of aerospace hardware and consumables and inventory and supply chain management services worldwide. Our aerospace distribution business is the product of both organic growth and a number of strategic acquisitions beginning in 2001. Through our global facilities network and advanced information technology systems, we believe we offer unparalleled service to commercial airline, business jet and defense original equipment manufacturers and their subcontractors (“OEMs”), airlines, maintenance, repair and overhaul (“MRO”) operators, fixed base operators (“FBOs”) and domestic military depots. With a large and diverse global customer base, including virtually all of the world’s commercial airline, business jet and defense OEMs, OEM subcontractors, airlines and major MRO operators across five continents, as well as the U.S. military, we provide access to over one million stock keeping units (“SKUs”). We serve as a distributor for every major aerospace fastener manufacturer. In order to support our vast range of custom products and services, we have invested well in excess of $100 million in proprietary information technology (“IT”) systems to create a superior technology platform. Our systems support both internal distribution processes and part attributes, along with customer services, including JIT deliveries and kitting solutions. This business is operated within our Aerospace Solutions Group (“ASG”) segment. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 (“Fiscal 2017”), ASG generated approximately 82% of our consolidated revenues.
 Our ASG segment has maintained strong, collaborative, long‑standing relationships with its customers. As a result of our operational and information technology systems, we have historically been able to ship approximately 60% of our orders within 24 hours of receipt of the order. Our seasoned purchasing and sales teams, coupled with state‑of‑the‑art IT and automated parts retrieval systems, help us to sustain our reputation for highly dependable, rapid, on‑time delivery.
 ASG sells fasteners and other consumable products to over 7,500 customer locations throughout the world. Its top five customers in Fiscal 2017 collectively accounted for approximately 30% of its Fiscal 2017 revenues.
 In the latter part of 2013, we initiated an expansion into the energy services sector. In 2013 and 2014, we acquired seven companies dedicated to providing technical services and related rental equipment to oil and gas exploration and production (“E&P”) companies. As a result, we now provide a broad range of solutions and equipment which bring value‑added resources to a new customer base, often in remote locations on an episodic or urgent 24/7 basis. Our customers include independent and major oil and gas companies that are engaged in the exploration and production of oil and gas properties in onshore North America, including in the Northeast (Marcellus and Utica Shale), Rocky Mountains (Williston and Piceance Basins), Southwest (Permian Basin and Eagle Ford) and Mid‑Continent. This business is operated within our Energy Services Group (“ESG”) segment.
 ESG has increased the number of its agreements with customers by over 140% from over 400 as of January 31, 2016 to over 1,000 as of January 31, 2018. These agreements enable us to work for substantially all of the major, regional and independent E&P companies in North America. ESG’s top five customers collectively represented approximately 20% of its Fiscal 2017 revenues.
 Our management team has extensive industry experience and company tenure. Our executive officers have an average of more than 20 years of employment in the aerospace or energy services industries.

 Review of Strategic Alternatives
 On December 22, 2017, we announced that our Board initiated a review of strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value, including a possible sale of KLX or a sale of a division or divisions thereof. We have engaged a financial and legal advisor to assist in the process. There can be no assurance of the terms, timing or structure of any transactions, or whether any such transactions will take place at all, and any such transactions are subject to risks and uncertainties. As our Board conducts its review, we remain committed to executing on our business strategies. We do not intend to make any further announcements related to our review unless and until our Board has approved a specific transaction or otherwise determined that further disclosure is appropriate. Industry Overview
 Aerospace Solutions Group
 ASG is generally segmented by end customer or sales channel. Based on our experience in this industry, we estimate that during Fiscal 2017 the market for the products and services provided by ASG was approximately $15.1 billion; of this amount, we estimate that approximately 52%, or $7.8 billion, is served by the manufacturers of these products and OEMs directly to the end customers and approximately 48%, or $7.3 billion, is served by distributors such as ASG.
 We believe that there is a direct relationship between demand for fasteners and other consumable products and airliner fleet size, aircraft utilization and aircraft age, as well as new aircraft production rates. All aircraft must be serviced at regular intervals, which drives aftermarket demand for aerospace fasteners and consumable products. ASG generated approximately 61% of its Fiscal 2017 revenues supporting original equipment manufacturers of commercial and military aircraft or aircraft system components and derived approximately 39% of its Fiscal 2017 revenues from aftermarket sales to support the in‑service fleet of commercial and military aircraft, and aircraft systems. Historically, aerospace fastener and consumable products revenues have been derived from the following sources:

· | Support for commercial, business jet and military aircraft OEMs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | Mandated aircraft maintenance;
--+-------------------------------


· | Support for commercial aircraft, business jet and defense subcontractors;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Demand for structural aircraft modifications, cabin interior modifications and passenger‑to‑freighter conversions; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Supply chain management and consumables hardware distribution for land-based military depot aftermarket customers and the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition, suppliers in the aerospace, defense and related industries often rely on companies such as ASG to provide a customized single point of contact for inventory management, customized invoicing, automated forecasting and usage monitoring, centralized communications and tracking across their broad and varied supply base.
 Since 2010, as the global economy began to recover from recession, increased passenger traffic volumes and the return to profitability of the global airline industry have created significant demand for commercial aircraft. Global air traffic demand increased 7.6% in 2017, well above the 10-year average annual growth rate of 5.5% and above the increase of 6.3% in 2016 and 7.4% in 2015. Air traffic growth in 2017 was supported by a broad-based pick-up in global economic conditions, lower cost airfares and strong consumer confidence. IATA forecasts a 2018 airline traffic increase of approximately 6%, above the historical trend for growth. 
 IATA expects the global airline industry to generate a profit of approximately $34.5 billion in 2017. Overall performance in 2017 has been positively impacted by strong passenger traffic growth, disciplined capacity management, 

 
  5

 
positive macroeconomic factors, and improved airline offerings that stimulate demand. These record industry profits were delivered despite a modest reduction in yields as compared with 2016. IATA expects global airline profits of $38.4 billion in 2018, or 11.3% higher than 2017, driven primarily by strong demand, efficiency and lower interest payments. The increase in global airline profits in 2018 is expected to be the eighth straight year of profitability, and the airlines have substantially strengthened their balance sheets over the past several years through operating profits and by accessing capital markets. As a result, we believe airline balance sheets are much stronger than in any time in the past ten years.
 Many airlines deferred the replacement of a large number of aging aircraft over the 2000‑2009 period. This, combined with recent more efficient new aircraft introductions, the growing requirements for more aircraft to support projected long‑term traffic growth, record capacity utilization rates, high fuel costs and the low cost of financing new aircraft drove the global airline industry to place record orders for new aircraft. Backlogs at Airbus S.A.S. (“Airbus”) and The Boeing Company (“Boeing”) stood at record levels of 7,253 and 5,864 aircraft, respectively, at January 31, 2018. Airbus reported that they have an approximate nine-year backlog. As a result, most industry analysts believe the outlook for new aircraft production and deliveries will be strong for the foreseeable future.
 The strong new aircraft delivery cycle and new contract wins and market share gains have resulted in an increase in ASG’s revenues to support the global aerospace manufacturing base. However, unlike any prior new aircraft delivery cycle, a record number of new aircraft deliveries were to replace and retire older, less fuel efficient aircraft. The increase in our revenues derived from manufacturing customers combined with the decline in aftermarket revenues and higher margins associated with older aircraft, which have been retired, has resulted in a shift in our revenue mix and has impacted our gross margins. Our aftermarket revenues include both commercial aerospace customers and our business serving U.S. military depots. We expect aftermarket revenues to trend upwards in 2018 and beyond, as a larger percentage of the approximately 12,500 new aircraft which have been delivered since 2009 begin to require their first heavy maintenance.

Defense spending has historically been driven by the timing of military aircraft orders and evolving government strategies and policies. We also support military depots for all five branches of our armed services, which maintain in-service aircraft and equipment. Defense spending began to decline in 2012 as the U.S. government implemented its sequestration program and began to sunset production of numerous military aircraft. As a result, we have seen demand from our military and defense manufacturing customers decline from peak levels experienced prior to 2012. However, as a result of recently enacted legislation, industry analysts expect defense spending to increase at a mid-single digit percentage annual rate over the next five years. Similarly, business jet manufacturing has declined since 2007 as a result of lower demand driven by austerity measures implemented by corporate customers, and the reduction in demand from businesses and countries affected by depressed conditions in the global oil and gas industry. However, this period of extended decline is expected to end in 2018 as business jet deliveries are expected to increase 4% in response to mid-single digit growth in business jet traffic and the introduction of new products expected to stimulate demand for new aircraft.
 Other factors expected to affect the industries served by ASG include long‑term growth in worldwide fleet of passenger aircraft, an increase in the size of the existing installed base, aging of existing fleet and an expected improvement in the business jet market.
 Energy Services Group
 The oil and gas industry has historically been both cyclical and seasonal. Activity levels are driven primarily by drilling rig counts, technological advances, well completions and workover activity, the geological characteristics of the producing wells and their effect on the services required to commence and maintain production levels, and our customers’ capital and operating budgets. All of these indicators are driven by commodity prices, which are affected by both domestic and global supply and demand factors. In particular, while U.S. natural gas prices are correlated with global oil price movements, they are also affected by local weather and consumption patterns.

 
  6

 

 While global supply and demand factors will continue to result in commodity price volatility, we believe the secular outlook for the on-shore North American oil and gas industry remains positive due to:

· | The projected long-term growth in global energy demand, combined with the United States’ long‑term goal of energy independence.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook 2017 Assumptions report, currently identified recoverable reserves of 276 billion barrels of shale oil and 2,355 trillion cubic feet of shale gas are contained within the United States.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Almost all E&P companies outsource the services required by them to drill wells and maintain production. Drilling and completion activities require numerous services and products from time to time on an “as needed” basis.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The decline of conventional North American oil and natural gas reservoirs, together with the development of new recovery technologies, is leading to a shift toward the drilling and development of onshore unconventional oil and natural gas resources that require more wells to be drilled and active maintenance to sustain production and maximize total recoveries. While drilling activity has recently improved and we expect improving operating conditions for oil field service companies, a return to profitability will require that energy supply and demand reach equilibrium and commodity prices stabilize at a level where our customers can achieve an appropriate return on their investments. We believe the increased requirements of these unconventional resources will continue to support increasing service activity as the industry rebalances its allocation of assets to meet future growth.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Technologically driven breakthroughs, including (i) continued drilling activity supported by unconventional resources, (ii) the expanding use of horizontal drilling techniques and (iii) longer lateral lengths and increasing number of stages per well, have all created growing demand for services and products to support these advanced drilling activities, many of which are in remote areas with harsh environments.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The increasing complexity of technology used in the oil and natural gas exploration and development process requires additional technicians on location during drilling. In particular, the increasing trend of pursuing horizontal and directional wells as opposed to vertical wells requires additional expertise on location and, typically, longer drilling times.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Other factors expected to affect the industry served by our ESG segment include:
 Growing Demand for Natural Gas in the United States. We believe that natural gas will be in increasingly high demand in the United States over time because of its growing popularity as a cleaner burning fuel. The ongoing shift to the use of natural gas from coal-fired power plants and the increased access to residential customers from new pipeline projects is expected to support increased demand for natural gas. In addition, the recent commencement of liquefied natural gas shipments from the United States to foreign markets is also expected to increase demand for natural gas production.
 Continued Outsourcing of Ancillary Services. Some of the services we provide have been historically handled by drilling contractors themselves. In many instances, these services are only ancillary to the primary activity of drilling and completing wells and represent only a minor portion of the total well drilling cost. Drilling contractors often elect to outsource these services to suppliers who have the expertise to be able to provide increasingly more complex, high‑quality and reliable services on a 24/7 basis.
 Impact of Recent Industry Downturn.  During the 2014 to mid-2016 industry downturn, prices of oil and natural gas declined rapidly, resulting in a dramatic reduction in drilling and completion activity by oil and gas producers in all regions of North America. Throughout all of 2015 and most of 2016, the oil field services industry experienced a deep retrenchment where both capacity of services across the industry was cut and the pricing of services became deeply 

 
  7

 
depressed. During this period, poorly capitalized businesses and many smaller competitors were unable to survive and went out of business. The industry began to see a stabilization in demand in late 2016, and with oil prices rising through the $40’s per barrel and into the $60’s in 2017, oil and gas producers renewed their commitment to their capital budgets, which resulted in a higher level of demand, improved pricing and a more stable operating environment for oil field services businesses. 
 Products and Services
 We conduct our business through two operating segments: ASG and ESG. Information about each of our operating segments is included below.
 Aerospace Solutions Group
 We believe, based on our experience in the industry, that we are one of the world’s leading independent distributors and value‑added service providers of aerospace fasteners and consumables, and that we offer one of the broadest ranges of aerospace hardware, consumables and inventory and supply chain management services worldwide. ASG, which was formerly the consumables management segment of B/E Aerospace, Inc. (our Former Parent), has evolved into an industry leader through multiple acquisitions, strong organic growth and strategic deployment of capital to address customer demand. As of January 31, 2018, ASG’s global presence consisted of approximately 1.7 million square feet in 25 principal facilities with over 2,000 employees worldwide. We believe ASG’s new global distribution and operations center together with the new warehouse management system will enhance future customer service while supporting productivity gains as well as allow for more effective inventory management as ASG consolidates inventory from three legacy facilities into the new facility.
 We have substantially expanded the size, scope and nature of our business as a result of a number of acquisitions. B/E Aerospace acquired M&M Aerospace Hardware in 2001 and it became the platform upon which the rest of ASG was built. Between 2002 and 2017, we completed nine acquisitions, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.2 billion. In 2016, we acquired Herndon Aerospace and Defense LLC, which principally serves U.S. domestic military depots that support in-service aircraft and other equipment for the five branches of the armed forces. We believe our organic growth together with these acquisitions has enabled us to position ourselves as a preferred global supplier to our customers. We have historically shipped approximately 60% of our orders within 24 hours of receipt of the order. With a large and diverse global customer base, including virtually all of the world’s commercial airline, business jet and defense OEMs, OEM subcontractors, major airlines and major MRO operators across five continents, we provide access to over one million SKUs that include aerospace fasteners and consumables, including chemicals, and related logistics services. Our service offerings include inventory management and replenishment, creative and differential supply chain solutions such as third‑party logistics programs, special packaging and bar‑coding, sophisticated parts kitting, quality assurance testing and a wide variety of purchasing assistance programs, plus the latest in electronic data interchange capability. Our seasoned purchasing and sales teams, coupled with state‑of‑the‑art IT and automated parts retrieval systems, help us to sustain our reputation for high‑quality products and rapid, on‑time delivery.
 We service our global customer base of approximately 7,500 customer locations with over 600 sales, marketing, product support and customer service specialists worldwide. Approximately 39% of our Fiscal 2017 ASG segment revenues were derived from the aerospace and airline aftermarket and approximately 61% from sales to OEMs and their suppliers to support manufacturing customers under long-term agreements. We are an authorized distributor for more than 200 manufacturers and distribute products for over 2,500 manufacturers. 
 We offer an extensive range of products, which we believe serves as a key competitive advantage for our business. Our portfolio consists of:

· | Fasteners. We stock inventory to support numerous commercial and military aircraft, business jets and helicopters. Our inventory position is highly diversified, supplying bolts, clips, hinges, rings, screws, carbon‑faced seals, gaskets, O‑rings and more. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Chemicals. We stock approximately 40,000 chemicals and specialty materials SKUs from over 1,000 manufacturers, which we distribute to over 6,000 customers globally. Among these products are chemicals, sealants and adhesives, lubricants, paints, cleaners and degreasers. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Honeywell Proprietary Parts. We hold an exclusive 20‑year license (with 10 years remaining on the original license), which will renew for two successive five‑year periods if certain operating metrics are maintained, on over 30,000 Honeywell proprietary parts. Among the product lines supported by these parts are auxiliary power units, propulsion engines, electrical/electro‑mechanical and airframe and engine accessories. We are also the primary supplier of these parts to Honeywell for their use during the manufacturing of the aforementioned products. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Bearings, Electrical, Clamps and Lighting. We sell lighting products to both OEMs and aftermarket customers. Other product families, such as bearings, tooling, electrical components and clamps, are more recent additions to our product line. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Motion and Control.Immediately before the end our fiscal year, we added a product line enabling us to offer our customers technical products, systems and expertise in motion and control applications including hydraulics, pneumatics, fluid connectors, filtration, electrical control systems seals, compressors and engineered systems for both OEM and aftermarket applications.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In addition, we substantially expanded our jet engine product support product line.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our product lines, which are deep and diverse, have an inventory valuation of approximately $1.4 billion.
 We believe we offer best‑in‑class customer service, with approximately 60% of all orders shipped within 24 hours of order receipt. Among the core services we offer are:

· | Sales and Technical Support. We routinely source alternate replacement parts, support part standardization, support our customers by avoiding stock outs, mitigating obsolete parts, actively defining and planning new products, locating suppliers who produce these engineered parts and increasing cost savings and operational and logistics readiness. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Delegated Inspection Authority. This service eliminates receiving inspection and reduces costs through lower record retention expenses, lower inspection expenses and less peer‑to‑peer engineering support and supplier oversight. Additionally, it allows for a better alignment of configuration and increases throughput. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Electronic Data Interchange (“EDI”). Reduces costs as it automatically places orders, processes documents, reduces lead times and stockholding and eliminates data entry errors. We offer two different systems, which are designed for specific customer types and/or their specific needs. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Symphony Direct Ship. Customers can place orders with us and then Symphony™, our proprietary inventory management system, routes these orders automatically to the appropriate supplier of these parts. The supplier will ship the parts directly to the customer by the date requested, eliminating a process queue and thus allowing for a database to be built over time. Products are stocked based on historical usage and forecasts. Through this process, we become the single point of contact for multiple approved suppliers to reduce our customers’ inventory and supplier base. Furthermore, we are able to offer a seamless order and billing process, while allowing full traceability of parts. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | E‑Commerce. A new, state-of-the-art e-commerce site was launched in January 2015. This service provides our customers with real‑time connection to our systems and inventory, where they can cross‑reference part numbers and also see product availability. E‑Commerce also provides customers with a customized solution and allows them to view usage reports for part planning and forecasting. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Energy Services Group
 We serve energy industry customers who focus on developing and producing oil and gas onshore in North America. We initiated our expansion in the U.S. onshore oil field services sector in August 2013 when we acquired 

 
  9

 
seven oilfield service companies operating in all key oil and gas shale basins for an aggregate purchase price of $0.7 billion (including deferred acquisition payments). We have integrated the operations of the seven acquisitions that comprise our current business and manage them both by service and product line offerings and by geographic markets. We offer a variety of services both individually and on a bundled basis as requested by our customers. Our E&P customers require numerous technical services and products on an “as needed” basis, including fishing (retrieval) services and equipment, wireline services, down-hole production services, pressure control, logging, pipe recovery and rental equipment to support these services. Much like the need for just‑in‑time delivery of consumables by ASG, ESG often is faced with just‑in‑time support requirements for our E&P customers that may be experiencing critical operating issues such as servicing an operating well under high pressures, or removing blockages during well drilling or production. As a result, our industry specialists (many with over 40 years of experience) are and may be on‑call (on a rotational basis) up to 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to meet our customers’ needs. 
 The market for services to support the drilling, completion and production of onshore oil and gas wells has expanded dramatically due to the technological advancements that allow for enhanced recovery from shale formations underlying much of the major onshore oil and gas reservoirs in the United States. This had led to growth in the market for the services we provide. We have established a solid presence in all the major onshore oil and gas producing regions in the contiguous 48 states (other than California), including the Northeast (Marcellus and Utica Shales), Rocky Mountains (Williston, DJ and Piceance Basins), Southwest (Permian Basin and Eagle Ford) and Mid‑Continent regions in North America. We serve energy industry customers who focus on developing and producing oil and gas onshore in North America. We have integrated the operations of the seven acquisitions that comprise our current business and manage them by both service and product line offerings and by geographic markets. We provide high‑quality services and products (new and remanufactured after use and American Petroleum Institute (“API”) certified) to remote drilling sites using our manufacturing, certification, logistics and IT capabilities to properly prepare for deployment, store, locate and deliver our equipment and service teams, as needed, to support our customers’ drilling operations. We also have a growing in-house proprietary tool development team which is focused on designing innovative tools that will further differentiate our services and enhance the outcomes for our customers.
 We offer a variety of complementary services, both individually and on a bundled basis, as requested by our customers. Our key service and product offerings include:

· | Fishing Services and Tools: Our fishing tool business provides a range of specialized services and equipment that is utilized on a non-routine basis for both drilling and well services operations. When intervention is required at the well site, we provide solutions for our customers. When downhole problems develop and drilling or services operations or conditions require non-routine intervention, technicians intervene with specialized tools that are specifically suited to retrieve, or “fish,” and remove trapped equipment. This equipment may include overshots, spears, jarring equipment, internal and external cutters, Venturi tools, magnets and wash over equipment. In addition to our fishing services, we also provide drill‑out services to our clients consisting of downhole motors used to drill out frac plugs and sliding sleeves. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Wireline Services: Our wireline services are provided through mobile units that contain large spools of wire. This large spool of wire will spool and unspool, which in turn allows tools and equipment to be quickly conveyed in and out of a wellbore. These wireline units and personnel provide a variety of different downhole services. These services include composite frac plug pump downs, pipe recovery and perforation, in addition to well evaluation and logging services. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pressure Control: We offer a full line of pressure control services and rental equipment to assist our clients at the wellsite. When a client moves on a well to perform completion or production activities, they are required to have some means of containing the pressure of the wellbore. Through the use of frac stacks, pressure valves and blow out preventers properly sized for the operation, operators are able to contain any release of pressure from the wellbore. We provide a full line of hydraulic and manual equipment, as well as services to keep them in proper working condition. We service this equipment at our operations facilities to ensure our equipment performs at the wellsite. As part of this service, we also provide rental pipe, power swivels, reverse units and other equipment used to perform well service operations.

 Energy Services Group
 ESG provides services and products and competes in a variety of distinct sub‑segments with a number of competitors. Substantially all of our ESG customers are engaged in the energy industry. Most of our sales are to regional or independent oil companies and these sales have resulted in a diversified and geographically balanced portfolio of more than 700 customers within North America. Revenues from ESG’s five largest customers collectively represented approximately 20% of ESG’s revenues in Fiscal 2017.
 Our primary competitors are regional, which provide a more limited range of services and rental equipment and often have more limited financial resources to support their operations. With respect to certain of our services, we also compete with major, multinational companies, including Superior Energy Services, Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Weatherford. Competition is based on a number of factors, including performance, safety, quality, reliability, service, price, response time and, increasingly, breadth of services and products.
 ESG maintains both regional and product/services specialist sales teams. Although sales employees tend to be based locally in regions and field locations, we have established a corporate sales team to coordinate sales and marketing efforts with our key accounts. As of January 31, 2018, we had 22 corporate sales representatives and 53 regional sales representatives with an average of 15 years of experience.
 Suppliers and Procurement
 Aerospace Solutions Group
 We do not believe we are dependent on any single supplier for our raw materials or specified and designed component parts and, based upon the existing arrangements with vendors, our current and anticipated requirements, we believe that we have made adequate provisions for acquiring raw materials.
 We have assembled a number of focused procurement teams which effectively source our broad range of products.

· | Planning/Forecasting. We plan and forecast to individual part number level for global demand, as well as forecast for each customer contract part number, utilizing customized software planning tools. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Commodity Procurement. We have specific commodity strategies with industry experts leading each team and key supplier partnership. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Program Procurement. We have a single supply chain point of contact for each major program coordinating supply, supplier health, forecasting gap buys and cost targets. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Advanced Sourcing. We have quick turnaround for customer demand on non‑stock items. If a customer has emergency requests such as an aircraft hold of service pending receipt of hardware, we will procure for immediate need. We also source new items and qualify alternative parts.

 Energy Services Group
 We purchase a wide variety of materials, components and partially completed and finished products from manufacturers and suppliers for our use. We are not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies, materials or equipment. Customer Service
 Aerospace Solutions Group
 We believe that our customers place a very high value on customer service, on‑time delivery and product support and that the level of customer service we provide is a critical differentiating factor in our industry. Our ASG segment brings the resources of an integrated global network, real‑time inventory systems and one‑on‑one personal attention to our customer relationships everywhere in the world. The key elements of such service include:
· | on‑time delivery;

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Customer service is particularly important to the airlines due to the high costs associated with incorrect or late deliveries.
 Energy Services Group
 We are highly differentiated in each of the geographic markets that we serve with our services and associated product offerings. This is achieved by providing targeted, complementary services and related products and being responsive to our customers with both quality, as measured by the industry-standard NPT, and timely response to any request. The key elements include:
· | 24/7 operations;
--+-----------------


· | recognized industry leading technicians in our principal service and product lines;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | responsiveness to our customers’ requirements for ready‑to‑deploy API certified equipment and a “can do” philosophy;

  Warranty Product Liability, Insurance
 Aerospace Solutions Group
 We warrant our ASG products, or specific components thereof, for periods ranging from one to three years, depending on product and component type. We receive appropriate product warranties and certifications from the manufacturer, and in the event of a defective part, we look to the manufacturer for reimbursement. Historically, warranty costs have not been material at ASG.

 The use of certain of our ESG rental equipment or the provision of technical services in connection therewith could involve operational risk and thereby expose us to liabilities. An accident involving our services or equipment, or the failure of a product, could result in personal injury, loss of life and damage to property, equipment or the environment. Damages from a catastrophic occurrence, such as a fire or explosion, could result in substantial claims for damages. We generally attempt to negotiate the terms of our MSAs consistent with industry practice. In general, we attempt to take responsibility for our own personnel and property, while our customers, such as the E&P companies and well operators, take responsibility for their own personnel, property and all liabilities arising from well and subsurface operations. 
 We maintain a risk management program that covers operating hazards, including product liability, property damage and personal injury claims as well as certain limited environmental claims. Our risk management program includes primary, umbrella and excess umbrella liability policies of $77 million per occurrence, including sudden and accidental pollution claims. We believe that our insurance is sufficient to cover product liability claims.
 Information Technology
 Aerospace Solutions Group
 We have invested over $100 million in proprietary IT systems within our ASG business. Our IT systems provide a powerful, highly distributed computing environment that enables us to quickly scale on demand as business dictates. Some of the benefits of our IT platform to our customers include services such as:
· | Planning and Forecasting

  Our information technology infrastructure is based on a proprietary application that has been highly customized for our aerospace consumables management business over the last 15 years. Our IT systems support our order‑to‑cash, procure‑to‑pay, warehouse management and accounting processes on a global basis. Our key proprietary IT application interfaces with our customized proprietary applications together with leading specialty software packages such as JDA (Demand Planning), Sterling (EDI) and Oracle (Business Intelligence, Financial Consolidations and Financial Reporting). We utilize a Microsoft-based enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system to support our ASG, ESG and Corporate activities.
 We also employ virtualization technology to increase system availability, reduce hardware and maintenance costs and respond efficiently to market dynamics. Our systems are largely hosted on Microsoft “Cloud” platforms as well as a stand-alone data services infrastructure which runs 24/7 and is protected by network security technologies, an uninterrupted power supply and a backup generator. Remote access to our systems is provided via separate, high speed connections.

 We have successfully integrated our acquisitions onto a single financial accounting platform using the aforementioned ERP system together with an industry leading rental asset management software “TrakQuip”. These IT systems provide us with a scalable integrated platform that facilitates highly efficient operations, consolidated invoicing and optimal equipment utilization on both a site and segment basis. Our operating strategy is based upon balancing high asset and personnel utilization levels with consistently superior customer service. As such, our IT systems are integral to effectively managing our business. Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
 Aerospace Solutions Group
 Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”), prescribe standards for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products, as well as regulations regarding the repair and overhaul of airframes, equipment and engines. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. In addition, the products we distribute must also be certified by aircraft and engine OEMs. If any of the material authorizations or approvals that allow us to supply products are revoked or suspended, then the sale of the related products would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 From time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations. If these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, we could incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 We are also subject to other government rules and regulations that include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (“FCPA”), as amended, the UK Bribery Act of 2010 (“UK Bribery Act”), the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC regulations”) the False Claims Act and the European Union’s Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (“REACH”).
 Energy Services Group
 Our ESG operations are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local laws and regulations establishing health, safety and environmental quality standards, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water and the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. We may be subject to liabilities or penalties for violations of those regulations. We are also subject to laws and regulations, such as the Federal Superfund Law and similar state statutes, governing remediation of contamination which could occur or might have occurred at facilities that we own or operate, or which we formerly owned or operated, or to which we send or have sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment, recycling or disposal. We believe that we are currently compliant, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, we could become subject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations. In addition, we may have liabilities or obligations in the future if we discover any environmental contamination or liability relating to our facilities or operations. Employees
 As of January 31, 2018, we had approximately 3,000 employees. As of January 31, 2018, our ASG segment had approximately 2,000 employees. Approximately 59% of ASG’s employees are engaged in distribution, operations, quality and purchasing, 30% in sales, marketing and product support and 11% in finance, human resources, IT and general administration. As of January 31, 2018, our ESG segment had approximately 1,000 employees. This represents a reduction of approximately 600 employees, or approximately 38% of our ESG workforce, from peak levels in 2014 in
