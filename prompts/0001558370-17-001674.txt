     Overview
     We are a biopharmaceutical company developing targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases. We use our proprietary technology to create novel small molecule drug conjugates, or SMDCs, and companion imaging agents. Our SMDCs actively target receptors that are over-expressed on diseased cells, relative to healthy cells. This targeted approach is designed to enable the treatment of patients with highly active drugs at greater doses, delivered more frequently, and over longer periods of time than would be possible with the untargeted drug alone. We are also developing companion imaging agents for each of our SMDCs that are designed to identify the patients whose disease over-expresses the target of the therapy and who are therefore likely to benefit from treatment. This combination of an SMDC with a companion imaging agent is designed to personalize the treatment of patients by delivering effective therapy, selectively to diseased cells, in the patients most likely to benefit. This approach is designed to yield multiple drug candidates that could treat disease through the following multiple mechanisms: by direct and targeted killing of diseased cells, by killing tumor-associated macrophages, or TAMs, which otherwise inhibit the immune system, or by activating the immune system directly by combining SMDCs with checkpoint inhibitors or our chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T-cell) immunotherapy approach.
     Vintafolide in Lung Cancer.  Our first generation SMDC, vintafolide, targets the folate receptor with the anti-cancer drug payload DAVLBH. The folate receptor is frequently over-expressed in some of the most prevalent and difficult to treat solid tumor indications. We identify the presence of the folate receptor in cancer patients by using etarfolatide, our proprietary companion imaging agent for vintafolide. We conducted a randomized phase 2b clinical trial called TARGET in folate receptor positive, or FR-positive, recurrent non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, patients comparing single agent vintafolide, the combination of vintafolide and docetaxel, and single agent docetaxel. Docetaxel is a commonly used second-line chemotherapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. We presented the final overall survival, or OS, data at the World Lung Cancer Conference in September 2015. At that meeting, we reported that vintafolide plus docetaxel improved median OS by 2.7 months in NSCLC regardless of histology (Median OS 11.5 vs. 8.8 months, OS HR=0.86, 95% CI [0.58, 1.26]). In the predefined subset analysis of patients with adenocarcinoma, which expresses higher levels of folate receptor, vintafolide plus docetaxel improved median OS by 5.9 months (12.5 vs. 6.6 months, HR=0.72, 95% CI [0.44, 1.16]). OS for vintafolide as a single agent was similar to docetaxel (OS 8.4 vs. 8.8 months, HR=1.02, 95% CI [0.70, 1.50]). The safety profiles of vintafolide alone and docetaxel alone were consistent with previous observations, but the combination of vintafolide and docetaxel resulted in higher rates of hematologic and peripheral neuropathy adverse events. Our current focus is on the development of our second generation folate targeted agent, EC1456, in second-line NSCLC and our first non-folate SMDC, EC1169, in advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC, as discussed below.
     EC1456 Phase I Trial.  EC1456, our second generation SMDC, like vintafolide, also targets the folate receptor. However, the drug payload and linker system in EC1456 have been modified to increase the potency and stability of the conjugate. In pre-clinical models, EC1456’s drug payload, tubulysin, has demonstrated a higher level of potency and less vulnerability to multi-drug resistance mechanisms compared to the drug payload in vintafolide. In some pre-clinical models in which vintafolide demonstrated no activity or there was a resistance to vintafolide, the folate tubulysin SMDC demonstrated activity. We are currently enrolling select FR-positive patients as determined by an etarfolatide scan in a phase 1b trial to evaluate EC1456 in up to 40 patients with NSCLC at the maximum clinical dose of 6.0 mg/m2 for a twice per week dosing schedule. Patients included in this expansion phase of the trial will have received first-line chemotherapy and may have also been treated with anti-programmed cell death-1 receptor, or anti-PD-1, therapy. We are also exploring a more frequent dosing schedule, four times per week, in indications that are typically FR-positive, such as ovarian and endometrial cancers. We presented data regarding the phase 1 dose escalation trial for the treatment of advanced solid tumors with EC1456 at the European Society for Medical Oncology, or ESMO, 2016 Congress in October. In spite of the inclusion of patients in the dose escalation phase who were not selected as positive for the targeted folate receptor, most patients demonstrated stable disease as best response and several patients demonstrated a reduction in target tumor volume. EC1456 has progressed in the phase 1 trial to a dose that exceeds the dose of vintafolide delivered in trials to date. In the phase 1b trial, we will evaluate single agent tumor response in NSCLC,

which will inform and may trigger additional work in combination therapies and indications such as triple-negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and endometrial cancer. We expect to provide safety and efficacy data updates for EC1456 in the first half of 2017. We are also currently conducting an ovarian cancer surgical study to assess various attributes of the drug release within targeted tumors.
     EC1169 Phase I Trial.  EC1169, our first non-folate SMDC, is a tubulysin therapeutic targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen, or PSMA. We are currently enrolling patients in a phase 1b trial to evaluate EC1169 in up to 100 second-line chemotherapy and taxane-naïve mCRPC patients at a maximum clinical once per week dose of 6.5 mg/m2. We have developed a companion imaging agent, EC0652, to scan patients prior to therapy to identify the presence of PSMA. Patients are scanned with EC0652, and while we are not limiting enrollment based on the results of the scan, the primary endpoints of the trial are to be assessed in PSMA-positive patients. To date, EC0652 has shown the presence of PSMA in at least one lesion in all prostate cancer patients scanned, but variability in the intensity of PSMA presence allows for selection criteria designed to enrich the patient population. The primary endpoint of this expansion phase is progression-free survival, or PFS, measured at five months for taxane-naïve mCRPC patients and at three months for second-line chemotherapy patients, and the secondary endpoints, which will provide earlier insight into drug activity, include overall response rates as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST, 1.1 and prostate-specific antigen, or PSA. We presented data regarding the phase 1 dose escalation trial for the treatment of mCRPC with EC1169 at ESMO 2016 Congress in October. The data showed that total target tumor burden reduction was observed in 4 of the 6 patients with measurable soft tissue disease treated at doses of 3.8 mg/m2 and higher. One of these patients demonstrated the first confirmed radiologic partial tumor response, or PR, as measured by RECIST 1.1 criteria. Two patients also demonstrated confirmed prostate specific antigen reductions of greater than 50%, one of whom went on to demonstrate the PR. We expect to provide safety and efficacy data updates regarding the phase 1b trial in the first half of 2017. Enrollment in an EC1169 receptor occupancy study is expected to begin in 2017 which is designed to provide insight into the drug’s interaction with the target receptor. Data regarding the EC1169 receptor occupancy study is expected in the second half of 2017.
     We currently have no commercial products and we have not received regulatory approval for, nor have we generated commercial revenue from, any of our product candidates.

 Our Technology Platform
     Our technology platform has enabled us to develop multiple new SMDCs for a range of disease indications. Each SMDC is comprised of three modules: a targeting ligand, a linker and a drug payload. Our companion imaging agents employ the same modular structure as our SMDCs, replacing the drug payload with an imaging agent.
    
     Targeting Ligand. Our technology is founded on our high-affinity small molecule ligands that bind to over-expressed receptors on target cells, while largely avoiding healthy cells. We are developing a number of targeting ligands to address a broad range of cancers and inflammatory diseases.
     Linker System. Our linker system attaches the targeting ligand to the drug payload or imaging agent. It is designed to be stable in the bloodstream, and to release the active drug from the targeting ligand when the SMDC is taken up by the diseased cell. The linker system can be customized for each SMDC and each companion imaging agent to improve its pharmacologic properties.
     Drug Payload. This module is the biologically active component of our SMDCs. The majority of our drug payloads are highly active molecules that are too toxic to be administered in their untargeted forms at therapeutic dose levels. We are using drug payloads in our SMDCs that were shown in our in vitro pre-clinical studies to be between 10,000 and 100,000 times more potent than traditional cancer cell-killing drugs such as cisplatin.
     With our modular approach, we use a variety of different targeting ligands, linker systems and drug payloads to create a pipeline of novel SMDC candidates for clinical development. For example, our PSMA targeting technology uses a targeting ligand that specifically binds to a receptor over-expressed on the surface of prostate cancer cells. We have developed alternative linker systems that modulate the pharmacologic and biodistribution properties of our SMDCs. We can also attach a wide variety of different drug payloads to our targeting ligands to address different disease indications. For example, we have SMDCs in pre-clinical development that incorporate proven anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory drug classes, such as microtubule destabilizers, DNA alkylators, proteasome inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors.

 In addition, our SMDC platform can be applied in a CAR T-cell immunotherapy setting to create a unique therapeutic approach that involves the re-targeting of potent immune cells. This approach makes possible the engineering of a single universal CAR T-cell, which binds with very high affinity to a molecule designated as Fluorescein isothiocyanate, or FITC. These cells are then used to treat various cancer types when co-administered with bi-specific SMDC adaptor molecules. These unique bi-specific adaptors are constructed with a FITC molecule and a tumor-homing molecule to precisely bridge the universal CAR T-cell with the cancer cells, which causes localized T-cell activation. In March 2017, we announced our plan to collaborate with Seattle Children’s Research Institute and Dr. Michael Jensen for the development of our SMDC platform in the CAR T-cell immunotherapy setting. The aim of the research collaboration is to join our SMDC bi-specific adaptor technology with the CAR T-cell immunotherapy research efforts at the Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research at Seattle Children’s Research Institute, to move these potentially enabling technologies more quickly to patients in the clinic.
     We own or have rights to over 400 issued patents and patent applications worldwide covering our core technology, SMDCs and companion imaging agents. Our U.S. patent covering our core technology, vintafolide, expires in 2026, and our U.S. patents covering etarfolatide expire in 2024. In 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office awarded us a patent with claims specifically directed to vintafolide entitled “Vitamin Receptor Binding Drug Delivery Conjugates.” EC1456 and EC1169 patent applications were filed in 2013, and if granted, should expire no earlier than 2033.
     Our Strategy
     Our strategy is to develop and commercialize SMDCs to treat patients who suffer from a variety of cancers and inflammatory diseases that are not well addressed by currently available therapies. The critical components of our business strategy are to:
· | Develop folate-targeted SMDCs in multiple indications. With the prevalence of folate receptor presence in the disease, NSCLC is a promising indication for folate targeted therapy. Our focus is on the development of our second generation folate targeted agent, EC1456. We are currently enrolling select FR-positive patients as determined by an etarfolatide scan in a phase 1b trial to evaluate EC1456 in up to 40 patients with NSCLC at the maximum clinical dose of 6.0 mg/m2 for a twice per week dosing schedule. We are also exploring a more frequent dosing schedule, four times per week, in indications that are typically FR-positive, such as ovarian and endometrial cancers. In the phase 1b trial, we will evaluate single agent tumor response in NSCLC, which will inform and may trigger additional work in combination therapies and indications such as triple-negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and endometrial cancer. We expect to provide safety and efficacy data updates for EC1456 in the first half of 2017. We are also currently conducting an ovarian cancer surgical study to assess various attributes of the drug release within targeted tumors.

· | Develop EC1169 for Prostate Cancer. We are currently enrolling patients in a phase 1b trial to evaluate EC1169 in up to 100 second-line chemotherapy and taxane-naïve mCRPC patients at a maximum clinical once per week dose of 6.5 mg/m2. We have developed a companion imaging agent, EC0652, to scan patients prior to therapy to identify the presence of PSMA. To date, EC0652 has shown the presence of PSMA in at least one lesion in all prostate cancer patients scanned, but variability in the intensity of PSMA presence allows for selection criteria designed to enrich the patient population. We expect to provide safety and efficacy data updates regarding the phase 1b trial in the first half of 2017. Enrollment in an EC1169 receptor occupancy study is expected to begin in 2017, which is designed to provide insight into the drug’s interaction with the target receptor. Data regarding the EC1169 receptor occupancy study is expected in the second half of 2017.

· | Build a pipeline of additional therapeutic SMDCs by leveraging our technology platform. We believe that the modular approach of our technology platform will allow us to efficiently expand our pipeline of SMDC candidates featuring various combinations of our targeting ligands, linker systems and drug payloads. We are currently evaluating EC1456 and EC1169 in ongoing clinical trials. We have multiple additional therapeutic SMDCs in pre-clinical development. EC2629 is a folate-pro pyrrolobenzodiazepine, or proPBD, DNA crosslinker drug that targets cancer cells and TAMs. EC2319 is a folate-targeted SMDC that targets a potent anti-inflammatory drug payload to activated macrophage for the treatment of various inflammatory indications. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are also developing a CAR-T application of SMDCs that involves the re-targeting of potent immune cells, which enables the utilization of a single CAR-T cell to target multiple cell targets using small molecule adaptors to bridge the CAR-T cells to diseased cells.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop companion imaging agents for each of our therapies. We believe that there is a significant opportunity to create targeted therapies where individual patients are selected based upon the use of non-invasive diagnostic tools. Our companion imaging agents may lower the risk of development of our SMDCs by allowing us to select for our clinical trials only those patients whose disease over-expresses the receptor targeted by our SMDCs. This benefit may, following any regulatory approval, extend to clinical practice by giving physicians the information they need to prescribe our SMDCs to patients who are most likely to respond to our therapy. We are currently evaluating etarfolatide and EC0652 for the selection of patients for folate-targeted and PSMA-targeted therapies, respectively. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Build commercial capabilities and partner to maximize the value of our SMDCs. We have retained all worldwide commercial rights to our SMDCs. If we obtain the required regulatory approvals to commercialize our oncology SMDCs in the United States, we intend to do so through our own focused sales force that we would build in connection with such commercialization efforts, or by co-promoting these SMDCs in collaboration with one or more larger pharmaceutical companies that have established capabilities in commercializing cancer therapies. Outside of the United States, we will consider partnering with established international pharmaceutical companies to maximize the value of our pipeline. In the large inflammatory disease markets, we expect to out-license our SMDCs, if approved, in order to mitigate their higher costs of development and commercialization.

      Our Small Molecule Drug Conjugate (SMDC) Technology
     Traditional cytotoxic cancer chemotherapies kill rapidly dividing cancer and normal cells in an indiscriminate manner, leading to significant toxicity in patients. The need for patients to recover from this toxicity can limit the ability to deliver effectively-dosed cancer therapy. In addition, cancer therapies for a given tumor type are generally selected based on observations of efficacy and toxicity in that patient population and not, in most cases, based on an understanding of the differences between tumors on a molecular level. In response to these limitations, a number of targeted therapies were developed to be more selective, including monoclonal antibody-based therapies. Due to their selectivity against certain cancers, antibody therapies have achieved tremendous therapeutic and financial success in recent years. According to Roche Holdings’ publicly available information, the three largest cancer drugs in the world, Avastin, Herceptin and Rituxan, are monoclonal antibodies, with collective U.S. sales of $9.2 billion in 2016.
     For certain cancers, antibodies alone are not sufficiently effective to achieve meaningful clinical benefit. This limitation has led to the development of a new class of agents called antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs. ADCs are comprised of a monoclonal antibody, which is used to target the specific cancer, attached via a linker system to a cell-killing drug. In clinical trials, ADCs have enabled the targeted delivery of highly active anti-cancer drugs, improving response rates in several cancer indications, with generally less toxicity than standard chemotherapy. However, ADCs also have limitations. First, larger molecules, like ADCs, do not penetrate dense solid tumors as efficiently as small molecules, and as a result, ADC efficacy may be compromised due to limited accessibility to the target cells. Second, the slow clearance of antibodies from a patient’s bloodstream following ADC treatment may lead to increased toxicity. Third, the longer half-life of ADCs has also limited the development of antibody-based imaging diagnostics due to the poor image quality associated with the high background noise caused by ADCs remaining in a patient’s bloodstream. Fourth, ADCs are biologic molecules that are costly and often complex to manufacture.
     We believe our SMDC platform represents a novel approach, comparable to ADCs, in its ability to deliver highly active drug payloads in a targeted manner, but also with a number of potential advantages:
    
· | Small size to better penetrate solid tumors. We believe a key characteristic of our SMDCs is their ability to penetrate deeply into dense solid tumors. The targeting ligands for our SMDCs are approximately 300 times smaller in molecular weight than a typical antibody incorporated in ADCs. This may result in greater uptake and higher concentrations of these molecules within solid tumors. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Rapid clearance for reduced toxicity. The circulating half-life of ADCs currently in development generally range from several hours to several days. In contrast, our SMDCs are engineered to provide rapid uptake in targeted cells and rapid clearance from the bloodstream with a half-life of approximately 20 minutes. As a result of this shorter half-life, we believe there is reduced risk that our SMDCs will release the unconjugated drug payload into the blood stream. The long circulating half-life of ADCs may provide a longer period for which they are available for cellular uptake, however our SMDCs can be delivered more frequently. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Companion imaging agents for targeted therapy. A companion imaging agent can be created for each of our SMDCs. Because of the modular nature of our SMDC technology, the drug payload can be replaced with a radioisotope imaging agent, such as technetium-99m, or Tc-99m, that we employ in etarfolatide and EC0652, to create a companion imaging agent designed to target the same diseased cells as the SMDC. The companion imaging agent is intended to allow for real-time, full-body assessment of the receptor target without requiring an invasive tissue biopsy. Using full-body imaging, the receptor expression can be measured in every tumor and monitored throughout treatment. In our clinical trials that combined vintafolide with etarfolatide, we have seen correlations between favorable therapeutic outcomes and increased uptake of etarfolatide. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cost-effective and simple to manufacture. Given the increasing pressure on drug pricing posed by payors, costs of development and manufacturing are increasingly important. Our SMDCs are relatively simple to manufacture and do not have the complexity and expense of biological molecules, like antibodies and ADCs. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      In pre-clinical studies, our SMDC therapies of vintafolide, EC1456 and EC1169, have been observed to eliminate human tumors in mice across multiple receptor positive tumor models, using regimens that caused little to no observable toxicity. In the same models, treatment at the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, with the free drug, DAVLBH or tubulysin, generated only modest or temporary tumor responses at best, and always in association with substantial toxicity. In addition, SMDC therapies caused no anti-tumor responses in pre-clinical tumor models that did not express the target receptor, thus confirming the SMDC’s specificity to the target receptor.
     Our SMDCs have also been evaluated in pre-clinical models for activity in combination with several approved chemotherapeutic agents. For example, vintafolide has shown significant anti-tumor responses in animals when dosed in combination with approved drugs, such as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or PLD, cisplatin, topotecan, bevacizumab, docetaxel, carboplatin, erlotinib and paclitaxel protein-bound. The toxicity profile of both SMDCs, particularly their lack of hematologic toxicity, make these SMDCs good potential candidates for combination therapies.
     Receptor Targets
     We are developing SMDCs to identify a variety of cancer and other disease receptor targets in addition to folate receptor and PSMA receptor targets. These receptors are over-expressed on diseased cells. An SMDC binds to the receptor and is internalized through a process known as endocytosis.

 Cellular Uptake of Folate
     The following image depicts the process by which a human cell internalizes folate.
    
     We select types of receptor targets on which to focus our development efforts through our biology screening system and the use of our companion imaging agents. The folate receptor is not significantly expressed on most normal tissues. Lung, brain, small intestine, kidney and activated macrophages are the normal tissues known to express the folate receptor. In the lung, brain and small intestine, the folate receptor does not face the bloodstream, thus these folate receptors are not accessible to our folate-targeted SMDCs. In the kidney, the folate receptor functions as a salvage receptor that captures folates and transports them back into the blood stream to prevent folate deficiency. Our drug payload does not appear to be released during this transport process and, as a result, we have not observed kidney toxicity with our folate-targeted SMDC therapies. Imaging is used to identify cellular targeting for specificity, thereby validating the receptor target as viable for potential therapy.

Market Opportunity for Folate Receptor Cancers
     The graph below shows the percentage of patients with different cancer types that are known to over-express the folate receptor. We estimate, based on worldwide cancer incidences combined with our own imaging studies, that there are over one million newly diagnosed cancer patients per year in the United States, Europe and Japan whose tumors over-express the folate receptor.
    
     Source: American Cancer Society and Endocyte estimates based upon imaging studies and tissue biopsies.
     Companion Imaging Agents for Patient Selection
     We believe the future of medicine includes not only safer and more effective drugs, but also the ability to identify the appropriate therapy for a particular patient. We are committed to this approach, which is commonly referred to as personalized medicine or precision medicine.
     Our technology allows us to create companion imaging agents intended for use with each of our SMDCs. Because of the modular nature of our SMDC technology, the drug payload can be replaced with a radioisotope imaging agent, such as Tc-99m, which we employ in etarfolatide, to create a companion imaging agent designed to target the same diseased cells as the SMDC and is easily seen with widely available nuclear imaging equipment. The companion imaging agent allows for real-time, full-body assessment of the receptor target without requiring an invasive tissue biopsy. Using full-body imaging, the receptor expression can be measured in every tumor and monitored throughout treatment. Potential key advantages of companion imaging agents over tissue-based samples include:
    
· | minimally invasive (not requiring biopsy);
--+-------------------------------------------


· | real-time assessment of tumor receptor expression (as opposed to analysis based on archived tissue);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | greater sensitivity because etarfolatide binds to all forms of the folate receptor (tissue sample analysis may understate folate receptor expression by not recognizing all forms of the folate receptor);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | greater specificity because etarfolatide distinguishes between those receptors accessible to folate in the blood and those not accessible (tissue sample analysis may overstate folate receptor expression); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | full-body evaluation (as opposed to samples of tumor which may or may not be indicative of all areas of disease).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The information provided by our companion imaging agents is used throughout the development of every new SMDC. In both pre-clinical and clinical trials, a companion imaging agent is used to validate targeting of our SMDC to specific tissues and cells. These companion imaging agents also allow for the screening of large patient populations to select diseases where a high percentage of the patient population have tumors or diseased cells that over-express the molecular target. These companion imaging agents may also enable us to expand the use of our SMDCs to cancer indications where the percentage of patients who over-express a given receptor target of interest may be relatively low. If we obtain regulatory approval, we believe companion imaging agents, such as etarfolatide, will help to identify patients who will most likely benefit from treatment with our SMDCs. As a result, use of our companion imaging agents may broaden the commercial use of our SMDCs, if approved.
     SMDC Pipeline
     We have a pipeline of multiple SMDCs and companion imaging agents that are in varying stages of clinical and pre-clinical development, all of which use our platform SMDC targeting technology. A summary of our most advanced development pipeline SMDCs and companion imaging agents are as follows:

     EC1456
     EC1456 is a second generation folate receptor-targeted SMDC. It is a conjugate of folate and an anti-cancer drug payload of tubulysin, a microtubule destabilizer that, in our in vitro models, showed more potency than DAVLBH. EC1456 is an investigational, proprietary, injectable SMDC consisting of folate (vitamin B9) linked to a potent cytotoxic agent, tubulysin B hydrazide, or TubBH. TubBH is a member of the tubulysin class of anti-neoplastic agents that inhibits the polymerization of tubulin into microtubules, a critical component during cell division. The targeting ligand folate, essential for cell division, has been established in vintafolide. EC1456 is the first SMDC with TubBH to enter clinical trials. Tubulysin alone is too toxic to be used in patients, rendering it impractical for therapeutic use. In contrast, our folate receptor-targeted tubulysin SMDC, EC1456, is curative in multiple xenograft models under conditions that produce no observable toxicities. EC1456 also employs a new spacer chemistry designed to reduce uptake in the liver which was believed to be the cause of dose limiting toxicities for vintafolide. EC1456 has progressed in a phase 1 trial to a dose that exceeds the dose of vintafolide delivered in trials to date.
     Based on the assessment of the presence and intensity of the folate receptor, the estimate of the FR-positive patient population and responses of human tumor xenografts in animals, we have selected NSCLC, triple-negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer as possible indications for evaluation of EC1456. We are currently enrolling select FR-positive patients as determined by an etarfolatide scan in a phase 1b trial to evaluate EC1456 in up to 40 patients with NSCLC at the maximum clinical dose of 6.0 mg/m2 for a twice per week dosing schedule. Patients included in this expansion phase of the trial will have received first-line chemotherapy and may have also been treated with anti-PD-1 therapy. We are also exploring a more frequent dosing schedule, four times per week, in indications that are typically FR-positive, such as ovarian and endometrial cancers. In the phase 1b trial, we will evaluate single agent tumor response in NSCLC, which will inform and may trigger additional work in combination therapies and indications such as triple-negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and endometrial cancer. We expect to provide safety and efficacy data updates for EC1456 in the first half of 2017. We are also currently conducting an ovarian cancer surgical study to assess various attributes of the drug release within targeted tumors.
     EC1169 in Prostate Cancer
     EC1169 is our first non-folate targeted SMDC and is designed to specifically target PSMA. PSMA is a cell surface protein found on nearly all prostate cancer cells. Similar to the folate receptor, PSMA has been shown to have an internalization signal that allows internalization of the protein on the cell surface into an endosomal compartment. EC1169 is designed to deliver a highly cytotoxic drug payload directly to PSMA receptors that are over-expressed on prostate cancer cells, with low toxicity to healthy cells. EC1169 consists of a targeting ligand, 2-[3-(1, 3-dicarboxy propyl)-ureido] pentanedioic acid, or DUPA, conjugated via a linker system to an anti-cancer drug payload, tubulysin. Tubulysin is a potent microtubule destabilizer. Because microtubules are critical for the separation of chromosomes during cell division, disruption of this microtubule system promotes cell death. Once EC1169 is internalized into the cell, the linker system is cleaved, releasing the tubulysin within the prostate cancer cell. In the development of EC1169, we are employing a companion imaging agent, EC0652, to help us better understand if we might be able to select patients that may respond better to treatment with EC1169.
     In March 2014, the FDA accepted the investigational new drug application, or IND, that we filed for EC1169. EC1169 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1b trial in up to 100 second-line chemotherapy and taxane-naïve mCRPC patients at a maximum clinical once per week dose of 6.5 mg/m2. We expect to provide safety and efficacy data updates regarding the phase 1b trial in the first half of 2017. Enrollment in an EC1169 receptor occupancy study is expected to begin in 2017 which is designed to provide insight into the drug’s interaction with the target receptor. Data regarding the EC1169 receptor occupancy study is expected in the second half of 2017.
     Vintafolide (EC145)
     Vintafolide is designed to deliver a highly cytotoxic drug payload directly to folate receptors that are over-expressed on cancer cells, with low toxicity to healthy cells. Vintafolide consists of a targeting ligand, folate, conjugated via a linker system to an anti-cancer drug payload, DAVLBH. DAVLBH is derived from a proven class of anti-cancer drugs 

 
  10

 
and is a potent destabilizer of microtubules. In preclinical models, this agent demonstrated 73,000 times the potency of the widely used chemotherapy, cisplatin. Since microtubules are critical for the separation of chromosomes during cell division, disruption of this microtubule system with DAVLBH promotes cell death. As folate is required for cell division, many rapidly dividing cancer cell types have been found to over-express high-affinity folate receptors. In clinical trials using our companion imaging agent, etarfolatide, we found that ovarian, non-small cell lung, breast, colorectal, kidney, endometrial and other cancers over-express folate receptors. Vintafolide binds to these folate receptors on cancer cells with high-affinity and is internalized through a process known as endocytosis. Once vintafolide is inside the cell, the linker system is cleaved, releasing the active drug payload within the cancer cell.
     Trial to Assess the benefit of folate-Receptor tarGEted Treatment of second-line NSCLC: Phase 2b Clinical Trial of Vintafolide for Second-Line NSCLC
     The TARGET trial design was intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vintafolide in second-line NSCLC as a single agent and in combination with docetaxel, a commonly used second-line chemotherapy approved by the FDA. The study met the primary endpoint of PFS for the combination vintafolide plus docetaxel arm, and we communicated the detailed data, including updated overall survival, or OS, results at ESMO 2014 Congress in September 2014. At that meeting, we reported that patients in the predefined adenocarcinoma subgroup treated with the combination had a 27% reduction in risk of the disease worsening or death and a 30% reduction in the risk of death compared to docetaxel monotherapy. We presented the final OS data at the World Lung Cancer Conference in September 2015. At that meeting, we reported that vintafolide plus docetaxel improved median OS by 2.7 months in NSCLC regardless of histology (Median OS 11.5 vs. 8.8 months, OS HR=0.86, 95% CI [0.58, 1.26]). In the predefined subset analysis of patients with adenocarcinoma, which expresses higher levels of folate receptor, vintafolide plus docetaxel improved median OS by 5.9 months (12.5 vs. 6.6 months, HR=0.72, 95% CI [0.44, 1.16]). OS for vintafolide as a single agent was similar to docetaxel (OS 8.4 vs. 8.8 months, HR=1.02, 95% CI [0.70, 1.50]). The safety profiles of vintafolide alone and docetaxel alone were consistent with previous observations, but the combination of vintafolide and docetaxel resulted in higher rates of hematologic and peripheral neuropathy adverse events.
     EC2629 in Cancer
     EC2629 is a folate receptor-targeted SMDC in pre-clinical development. It is constructed with a very potent DNA crosslinking drug that can attack both cancer cells and TAMs. We have extensively tested EC2629 against multiple pre-clinical models and, to date, have seen curative activity with as little as one or two doses, which represents a significant improvement in activity when compared to other less potent and untargeted DNA-reactive drugs, such as platinum agents, which have historically shown significant activity against a variety of cancers under conditions of dose-limiting toxicity. Based on our positive pre-clinical findings, we expect to file an IND application for EC2629 in mid-2017 and expect to begin enrollment of a phase 1 trial in the second half of 2017. 
     EC2319 in Inflammation
     EC2319 is a folate receptor-targeted SMDC in pre-clinical development for treatment in inflammatory diseases. Utilizing an identical strategy to that which we applied in the development of our oncology programs, SMDCs designed for treating inflammation may be constructed with more potent forms of known, active drugs, and then used along with companion imaging agents to provide personalized therapy. Using our folate receptor-targeted etarfolatide companion imaging agent in both pre-clinical and clinical trials, we have identified a number of diseases involving activated macrophages that over-express the folate receptor, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis. 
     In our pre-clinical models of rheumatoid arthritis, SMDCs targeted to activated macrophages resulted in significant reduction in inflammation and prevention of bone destruction that often accompanies this disease. EC2319 is a SMDC constructed with the targeting ligand, folate, and an inhibitor of cellular metabolism, called aminopterin. We observed in pre-clinical models that EC2319 was safe and reduced inflammation more than the most commonly prescribed anti-inflammatory agent, methotrexate, and the anti-TNF-alpha agent, etanercept. As a first step in development, EC2319 is being tested in a naturally occurring arthritic animal model to guide future development decisions.

 EC0371 (Polycystic Kidney Disease)
     EC0371 is a folate receptor-targeted SMDC in pre-clinical development for treatment of polycystic kidney disease, or PKD. This is an opportunity to provide a new treatment to a disease with a very high unmet need.
     PKD affects approximately 650,000 people in the U.S., and over 12 million people worldwide suffer from PKD. There are no effective treatments for this disease. We have identified a receptor target and are performing pre-clinical testing in a variety of SMDCs with different drug payloads.
     SMDC Bi-specific Adaptor Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR T-cell) Immunotherapy in Cancer
     We are developing a unique therapeutic approach that involves the re-targeting of potent immune cells, called CAR T-cells, to fight cancer. Proprietary small molecule bi-specific “adaptor” molecules are used in combination with our universal CAR T-cells to effectively wake up a patient’s immune system with the hope of eliminating the malignant disease. The SMDC bi-specific adaptor CAR T-cell technology leverages our SMDC platform and prior immunotherapy clinical experience into a unique approach to potentially address some of the challenges of the current CAR T-cell technologies. This approach has been shown pre-clinically to address three key CAR T-cell issues by: (i) avoiding hyper-activation of CAR T-cells leading to a cytokine storm, (ii) enabling termination of CAR T-cell activity upon eradication of the tumor, and (iii) potentially enabling elimination of all cancer cells in heterogeneous solid tumors. In March 2017, we announced our plan to collaborate with Seattle Children’s Research Institute and Dr. Michael Jensen for the development of our SMDC platform in the CAR T-cell immunotherapy setting. The aim of the research collaboration is to join our SMDC bi-specific adaptor technology with the CAR T-cell immunotherapy research efforts at the Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research at Seattle Children’s Research Institute, to move these potentially enabling technologies more quickly to patients in the clinic.     Companion Imaging Agents
     Etarfolatide: Lead Companion Imaging Agent for Folate-Targeted Therapies
     Etarfolatide is the companion imaging agent for all of our SMDCs that target the folate receptor. Etarfolatide is a conjugate of the targeting ligand folate and the radioisotope imaging agent Tc-99m. Following intravenous administration, etarfolatide rapidly binds to tumors that over-express the folate receptor, allowing the treating physician to identify patients who are FR-positive and would be more likely to benefit from our targeted therapies. Etarfolatide enables high quality diagnostic scans in approximately one hour following its administration as a result of the quick clearance from the blood of etarfolatide not taken up by cells which over-express the folate receptor.     Etarfolatide Development Plan
     In the U.S., etarfolatide is being developed under the FDA’s published guidance regarding usage of imaging agents for therapeutic management of patients. Consistent with this guidance, our development strategy for etarfolatide will be to show that the presence of etarfolatide uptake in tumors is predictive of improved therapeutic outcomes resulting from treatment with our SMDCs.
     With an estimated incidence of over one million newly diagnosed cancer patients per year in the United States, Europe and Japan who have tumors that over-express the folate receptor, etarfolatide could, if approved, represent a substantial commercial opportunity for us as a screening diagnostic. Companion imaging agents are an important part of our development and commercial plan, which may allow us not only to provide a targeted therapy, but also a truly personalized and more effective therapy. This could benefit patients, doctors and payors by allowing doctors to select only patients who are most likely to benefit from our therapies.
     We conducted an additional inter-reader analysis to further determine the reliability of etarfolatide. Five independent radiologists/nuclear medicine physicians read images from the PROCEED study, our phase 3 trial which evaluated the treatment of vintafolide in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, or PROC, patients, and the evaluation resulted in a 76.7 percent agreement rate (0.69 Kappa) among all five readers in selecting patients with all target lesions 

 
  12

 
positive for the folate-receptor, FR (100%), and a 73.3 percent five reader agreement (0.71 Kappa) in selecting patients with at least one tumor positive for the folate-receptor, FR (10 – 100%). This provides evidence supporting the reliability of the etarfolatide scan process to consistently classify patients.
     We have been capitalizing on advancements in imaging hardware and software to enhance patient selection. We are using hybrid SPECT cameras with built-in CT scanners to create relatively high resolution images. This improved clarity promotes quantification of tumor uptake, better assessment of potential heterogeneity within a single tumor, and the possibility to assess non-targeted disease. Better resolution has also led to our results becoming progressively more reproducible, with outstanding levels of concordance between independent readers. These enhancements will be incorporated into our clinical trials as we select patients most likely to benefit from therapy.
     EC0652
     In January 2013, we announced the achievement of key objectives in a phase 0 study of EC0652, a diagnostic imaging agent targeting PSMA, a protein expressed on cancer cells originating from the prostate as well as on tumor neovasculature. The prostate cancer imaging agent EC0652, also termed DUPA- 99m Tc, is a conjugate of the high affinity PSMA-targeting ligand DUPA to technetium 99m (99m Tc). The discovery process utilized a unique structure-based drug design approach to synthesize the ideal targeting ligand for binding to PSMA. The corresponding SMDC, EC1169, utilizes the same targeting ligand. Based on the observed safety of the agent and its specificity for binding to diseased cells, we are advancing the development of both the diagnostic imaging agent, EC0652, and the corresponding therapeutic agent, EC1169, a proprietary PSMA-targeted SMDC linked with tubulysin. In March 2014, the FDA accepted the IND we filed for EC1169, and in July 2014, the FDA accepted the IND we filed for EC0652. We have initiated a phase 1 trial in advanced prostate cancer for EC1169, and we are imaging patients with EC0652.
     Competition
     The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities and research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our SMDCs. A number of multinational pharmaceutical companies and large biotechnology companies are pursuing the development of or are currently marketing pharmaceuticals that target NSCLC, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer, or other oncology pathways on which we are focusing. It is possible that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of unmet medical needs in oncology will increase.
     Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drugs, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
     Recent successes with targeted therapies in solid tumors, such as those found in colon, breast, lung and ovarian cancers, have led to a marked increase in research and development in targeted treatments for cancer. We are aware of multiple competitors with many advanced clinical trials and clinical data under review by regulatory authorities for potential commercial approval in triple-negative breast cancer, endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer, among others.
     We are also aware of a number of companies that have ongoing programs to develop both small molecules and biologics to treat patients with NSCLC. NSCLC is at the forefront of patient segmentation based on therapeutic targets, restricting use of untargeted agents to patients without a detectable target mutation, later lines of therapy, or combination regimens. Epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, positive patients and anaplastic lymphoma kinase, or ALK, positive patients are each sub-segments of NSCLC patients that have been bolstered with recent approvals of agents shown to benefit those who have progressed after treatment with first line, targeted agents (e.g. gefitinib or crizotinib).

AstraZeneca PLC received approval for its third-generation, small molecule, EGFR TKI osimertinib, which treats patients who have acquired secondary EGFR-T790M mutations following treatment with a first- or second-generation EGFR TKI. Ceritinib (Novartis AG) and alectinib (Roche Holdings’ Genentech) are both approved in metastatic, ALK+ patients who have failed or become intolerant to crizotinib. Anti-programmed cell death-1 receptor (PD-1) inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, and Merck & Co, Inc., respectively, have been granted FDA approval in second-line NSCLC. Pembrolizumab is the first PD-1 agent to gain approval in first-line NSCLC, but is restricted to patients that express >50% PD-L1 in their disease. Roche Holdings (atezolizumab), AstraZeneca PLC (durvalumab) and Merck KGaA/Pfizer (avelumab) are also aggressively developing PD-L1 agents. Atezolizumab is the first PD-L1 agent approved in NSCLC in patients that have failed platinum therapy or the appropriate targeted therapy regardless of PD-L1 expression. PD-1 is an inhibitory costimulatory molecule found on activated T cells. PD-L1 is a transmembrane protein ligand of PD-1. The formation of PD-1/PD-L1 complexes transmit an inhibitory signal which reduces the proliferation of activated T cells which has been shown to play a role in negatively impacting the body’s ability to recognize and fight cancer. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents are meaningfully changing the treatment paradigm in NSCLC and other cancer indications, and in turn may negatively affect our ability to effectively develop our SMDC therapeutics.
     Other targeted therapies that have submitted New Drug Applications for NSCLC include MEK inhibitor trametinib (Novartis AG), dual EGFR/ALK inhibitor brigatinib (ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (Novartis AG). Phase 3 agents include CDK 4/6 Dual Inhibitor abemaciclib (Eli Lilly & Company), mutation-positive EGFR inhibitors olmutinib (Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) and ASP8273 (Astellas Pharma, Inc.) and angiogenesis inhibitor (via VEGF/PDGF/FGF) nintedanib (Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH). Many more targeted agents are in phase 2 development by biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms including Amgen, Inc., Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc., AstraZeneca PLC, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Calithera Biosciences, Inc., Cellular Biomedicine Group, Inc., Eisai Co., Ltd., Eli Lilly & Company, Exelixis, Inc., Fortress Biotech, Inc., Helix BioPharma Corporation, Ignyta, Inc., Immunomedics, Inc., Incyte Corporation, Juno Therapeutics Inc., Kadmon Holdings, Inc., Kite Pharma, Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Mirati Therapeutics, MolMed S.p.A., Novartis AG, OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Otsuka Holdings Co., Ltd., Pfizer Inc., Puma Biotechnology, Inc., Roche Holdings AG, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd, and Verastem, Inc.
     We are aware that mCRPC is a competitive market as well. Several recent approvals have added to the competition. The most recent approvals include Zytiga (Janssen Biotechnology, Inc.), Xtandi (Medivation/Astellas Pharma, Inc.), Taxotere (Sanofi Aventis), Jevtana (Sanofi), Provenge (Dendreon), and Xofigo (Bayer AG). We are also aware of a number of companies developing products to treat mCRPC. Some of these products in late-phase development include apalutamide (Johnson & Johnson), Prostvac (Bavarian Nordic GmbH), Lynparza (AstraZeneca PLC), ODM-201 (Orion/Bayer HealthCare), ProstAtak (Advantagene, Inc.), Yervoy (Bristol-Myers Squibb), Stapuldencel-T (Sotio Group), Custirsen (OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), and Masitinib (AB Science). Additional products with studies in the late-stage setting include DCVac/PCa (Sotio Group), and Tecentriq (Roche Holdings’ Genentech).
     We are also aware of several ongoing clinical trials in the Phase I and Phase II mCRPC setting. These include, but are not limited to, ADXS31-142 (Advaxis), ASN001 (Asana BioSciences, LLC), ATL101 (ATLAB Pharma SAS), FG920 (Novartis), CV9104 (CureVac GmbH), EPI-506 (ESSA Pharma, Inc.), GVAX (Johnson & Johnson), KX01 (Athenex, Inc.), LY3023414 (Eli Lilly & Company), MEDI6469 (AstraZeneca), Niraparib (Tesaro, Inc.), Onapristone (Arno Therapeutics, Inc.), Osteodex (DexTech Medical AB), PSMA ADC (Progenics), Rubraca (Clovis Oncology), Seviteronel (Innocrin Pharmaceuticals), SHR3680 (Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co.), and TRC105 (TRACON Pharmaceuticals).
     We believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things:
    
· | our ability to design and successfully execute appropriate clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our ability to recruit and enroll patients for our clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the results of our clinical trials and the efficacy and safety of our SMDCs and companion imaging agents;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  14

 

    
· | the speed at which we develop our SMDCs and companion imaging agents;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | achieving and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements applicable to our business;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, including labeling;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | adequate levels of reimbursement under private and governmental health insurance plans, including Medicare;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our ability to protect intellectual property rights related to our SMDCs and companion imaging agents;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our ability to commercialize and market any of our products that may receive regulatory approval;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our ability to have our partners manufacture and sell commercial quantities of any approved SMDCs and companion imaging agents to the market;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | acceptance of SMDCs and companion imaging agents by physicians, other healthcare providers and patients; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the cost of treatment in relation to alternative therapies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

      In addition, the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Our future will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies. Our competitors may render our technologies obsolete by advances in existing technological approaches or the development of new or different approaches, potentially eliminating the advantages in our drug discovery process that we believe we derive from our research approach and proprietary technologies. Also, because our research approach integrates many technologies, it may be difficult for us to stay abreast of the rapid changes in each technology. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. Technological advances or products developed by our competitors may render our SMDCs or companion imaging agents obsolete or less competitive.
     Manufacturing
     To date, our SMDCs and companion imaging agents have been manufactured in small and medium size quantities for pre-clinical studies, clinical trials and validation activities by third-party manufacturers and we intend to continue to do so in the future. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our SMDC candidates. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. To meet our projected needs for pre-clinical development and clinical trials, third parties with whom we currently work have sufficient capacity, but they may need to increase their scale of production or we may need to secure alternate suppliers. We have identified several manufacturers that have the capacity to manufacture etarfolatide in the quantities that our development and future commercialization efforts, if any, may require. We have utilized two such suppliers to date. We expect to continue to depend on third-party contract manufacturers for the foreseeable future.
     Our SMDCs and companion imaging agents require precise, high quality manufacturing. Failure by our contract manufacturers to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards could result in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in testing or delivery, cost overruns, or other problems that could seriously harm our business.
     Sales and Marketing
     Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring, developing and securing our technology, undertaking pre-clinical testing and clinical studies of our SMDCs and companion imaging agents and engaging in research and development under collaboration agreements. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain regulatory approval, formulate and manufacture commercial-scale products, or conduct sales and 

 
  15

 
marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, it is difficult to predict our future success and the viability of any commercial programs that we may take forward.
     We entered into a license and commercialization agreement with Nihon Medi-Physic Co., LTD., or NMP, that grants NMP the right to develop and commercialize etarfolatide in Japan for use in connection with vintafolide in Japan. To date, the products have not been approved in Japan and no revenue has been recognized related to the regulatory milestones or royalties. We have retained all worldwide commercial rights to our SMDCs. If approved, we intend to commercialize our oncology SMDCs in the United States through our own focused sales force that we would build in connection with such commercialization efforts, or by co-promoting these SMDCs in collaboration with one or more larger pharmaceutical companies that have established capabilities in commercializing cancer therapies. Outside of the United States, we would consider partnering with established international pharmaceutical companies to maximize the value of our pipeline. In the large inflammatory disease markets, we currently expect to out-license our SMDCs in order to mitigate their higher costs of development and commercialization. With the exception of the rights granted to NMP with respect to etarfolatide in Japan, we have retained all worldwide commercial rights to etarfolatide, and, if approved, we intend to commercialize etarfolatide through our own sales force.
     Research and Development, and Raw Materials
     For information regarding the amount spent by us on company-sponsored research and development activities during each of the last three fiscal years, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations herein.
     We procure raw material components for our drug payloads, linkers, and spacers from a core group of principal suppliers. In order to meet our clinical trial needs, we are required to enter into agreements with third party manufacturing facilities for certain production needs and for fill and finish capabilities.
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 76 full-time employees, 60 of whom were engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced a work stoppage and consider our relations with our employees to be good.     Government Regulation
     Government authorities in the United States (including federal, state and local authorities) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, and export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.     United States Government Regulation
     In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and related regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the imposition by the FDA or an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, of a clinical hold on trials, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.

 The Investigational New Drug Process
     An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured before commencing clinical trials of any new drug candidate in humans in the U.S.
     The central focus of the initial IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of animal studies or other human studies, as appropriate, as well as manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold until any outstanding concerns or questions are resolved.
     Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to patients under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical site’s IRB before the trials may be initiated. All participants in clinical trials must provide their informed consent in writing prior to their enrollment in the trial.
     The clinical investigation of an investigational drug is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of a clinical investigation are as follows:
    
· | Phase 1. Phase 1 involves the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. Phase 1 clinical trials are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on efficacy. During phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid phase 2 clinical trials. The total number of participants included in phase 1 clinical trials varies, but generally ranges from 20 to 80. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2. Phase 2 includes the clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the efficacy of the investigational drug for a particular indication in patients with the disease or condition under study, to further define safety, tolerability, and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well controlled, closely monitored and conducted in a limited patient population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting efficacy of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, safety, and effectiveness to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval by the FDA. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The decision to terminate development of an investigational drug may be made by either a health authority body such as the FDA or by us for various reasons. Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, or committee. This group provides a recommendation of whether or not a trial may move forward at pre-specified check points based on access that only the DSMB maintains to available data from the trial. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an 

 
  17

 
unacceptable health risk. We may decide to suspend or terminate development based on evolving business objectives and/or the competitive climate.
     In addition, there are requirements and industry guidelines that require the posting of ongoing clinical trials on public registries and the disclosure of designated clinical trial results and related payments to healthcare professionals.
     Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational drug information is submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application, or NDA, except under limited circumstances, requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications.
     The NDA Approval Process
     In order to obtain approval to market a drug in the United States, an NDA must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for the proposed indication to the FDA’s satisfaction. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent pre-clinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators.
     The FDA will initially review the NDA for completeness before it accepts the NDA for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
     Based on phase 3 clinical trial results submitted in an NDA, upon the request of an applicant a priority review designation may be granted to a product by the FDA, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months. Priority review is given where preliminary estimates indicate that a product, if approved, has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists, or a significant improvement compared to marketed products is possible. If criteria are not met for priority review, the standard FDA review period is ten months. The timing of the priority or standard review period begins after the initial 60 day decision regarding acceptability of the submission for filing and substantive review. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. Other designations, such as breakthrough or fast track designation, are also potentially available and can help expedite development and approval of investigational new drugs. 
     Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
     The testing and approval process for a drug requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and this process may take several years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be 

 
  18

 
susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to develop our SMDCs or companion imaging agents and secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. Even if the FDA approves an SMDC or companion imaging agent, it may limit the approved indications for use or place other conditions on approval that could restrict commercial application, such as a requirement that we implement special risk management measures through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
     Post-Approval Regulation
     After regulatory approval, if any, of a drug product is obtained, we would be required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of an NDA, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the OS benefit of the drug. The FDA has indicated to us that if we receive approval of a drug based on PFS data, we will be required to continue to follow patients in the registration trial to determine the OS benefit of the drug. In addition, as a holder of an approved NDA, we would be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and effectiveness information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of our products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval to assure and preserve the drug product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record-keeping requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
     Europe/Rest of World Government Regulation
     In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject, either directly or through our distribution partners, to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
     Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
     The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and other applicable regulatory requirements.
     To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. This application is similar to the NDA in the United States, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. Medicines can be authorized in the European Union by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures, and our SMDCs and companion imaging agents fall under the centralized authorization procedure.

 
  19

 

     The European Commission may grant conditional marketing authorization for a product that addresses an unmet medical need while additional development work is being completed. Conditional marketing authorization is subject to annual review, and such authorization may be limited or even withdrawn if subsequent development work is not satisfactory or fails to confirm the clinical benefit of the product.
     The European Commission implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the European Union. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the European Commission that is valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering; contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions; and officially designated orphan medicines.
     Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
     For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the other applicable regulatory requirements.
     If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
     Compliance
     During all phases of development (pre- and post-marketing), failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the following actions by the FDA or other regulatory authorities: imposition of a clinical hold on trials; refusal to approve pending applications; withdrawal of an approval; warning letters; product recalls; product seizures; total or partial suspension of production or distribution; product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products; injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
     We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our SMDCs. Future FDA and state inspections or inspections by other regulatory authorities may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s or other regulatory authorities’ policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.

 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
     Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our SMDCs may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
     In 2003, the United States government enacted legislation providing a partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products. Federal, state and local governments in the United States continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, and its amendment, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, were enacted in 2010. Since then, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted, including the Budget Control Act of 2011, which resulted in reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year from April 2013 through 2024 unless additional congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers. We expect additional state and federal healthcare reform measures to be adopted in the future, which could limit payments or otherwise negatively impact reimbursement for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing.
     We also face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the PPACA, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the United States may have on our business.
     Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular SMDC to currently available therapies. Other member countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
     The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if 

 
  21

 
favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
     Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
     In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act, the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Under the Veterans Health Care Act, or VHCA, drug companies are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies including the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service designated entities in order to participate in other federal funding programs including Medicare and Medicaid. Legislative changes purport to require that discounted prices be offered for certain U.S. Department of Defense purchases for its TRICARE program via a rebate system. Participation under the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.
     In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities or register their sales representatives, as well as prohibiting pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
     Patents and Proprietary Rights
     Because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products to market, biopharmaceutical companies have traditionally placed considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent protection for significant new technologies, products and processes.
     Our success depends in part on our ability to protect the proprietary nature of our SMDC candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. As a matter of policy, we seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing United States and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
     We have applied, and are applying, for patents directed to our three main areas of focus: anti-tumor therapeutics and diagnostics, anti-inflammation therapeutics and diagnostics and immunotherapy therapeutics and diagnostics, both in the United States and, when appropriate, in other countries. We own or have rights to over 400 issued patents and applications worldwide covering our core technology, SMDCs and companion imaging agents.

 
  22

 

     Several of the patents we own relate to vintafolide or etarfolatide compositions of matter. For example, patent number 7,601,332, or the ’332 patent, entitled “Vitamin Receptor Binding Drug Delivery Conjugates”, patent number 8,105,568 or the ’568 patent, with the same title, patent number 7,128,893, or the ’893 patent, entitled “Vitamin-Targeted Imaging Agents,” patent number 7,862,798, or the ’798 patent, also entitled “Vitamin-Targeted Imaging Agents” and patent number 8,313,728 with the same title, or the ’728 patent, relate to these compounds. The ’332 patent was issued on October 13, 2009 in the United States and is scheduled to expire in 2026. The ’332 patent includes claims covering vintafolide, among other compounds. The ’568 patent is a continuation to the ’332 patent and claims the vintafolide structure specifically. In 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, awarded us the ’568 patent. Additionally, we have filed continuation patent applications to the ’568 patent and prosecution is ongoing. With respect to vintafolide coverage, we have patents issued in the United States, Canada, Japan, many European nations including Germany, Spain, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy, as well as Australia, China, India, Israel, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Africa. Applications are pending in the United States, Europe, Israel, Hong Kong, Argentina and Venezuela. We also have issued patents and pending applications directed to compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods for linking vitamins to drugs through our linker system. We also have filed several patent applications related to vintafolide specifically, such as, for example, using etarfolatide to predict patients’ response to vintafolide and methods of treatment with the combination of vintafolide with docetaxel.
     The ’893 patent and ’798 patent were issued on October 31, 2006 and on January 4, 2011, respectively, in the United States and are both scheduled to expire in 2024. The ’893 patent and ’798 patent include claims covering etarfolatide, among other compounds. Additional patents have issued which are continuations. The ’798 patent was one such continuation application issued as a patent as was the ’728 patent. Patent claims covering etarfolatide have issued outside of the United States. For example, we have obtained etarfolatide coverage in many European jurisdictions.
     We have filed additional patent applications worldwide to protect additional innovations such as tubulysin conjugates, including EC1456, and conjugates directed to the PSMA, including EC0652 and EC1169. EC0652 is owned by the Purdue Research Foundation, a non-profit organization, which manages the intellectual property of Purdue University, and is exclusively licensed to us.
     Based on research we fund at Purdue University, we have entered into three exclusive, worldwide in-licenses for a number of patents and patent applications owned by the Purdue Research Foundation related to select folate-targeted technology, select technology related to PSMA, and select technology related to other ligands. The folate-technology license was originally entered into on July 17, 1998 with an effective date as of December 21, 1995, and was restated on October 21, 1998. The PSMA license was entered into on March 1, 2010. The license to other technologies was entered into in 2014 with an effective date of July 1, 2013. Under these three licenses, over 80 patents and published applications are licensed to us.
     We may terminate the Purdue Research Foundation licenses without cause with 60 days notice for the folate and PSMA licenses and three months notice for the license directed to other ligands. Purdue Research Foundation may terminate any of the licenses for material default by us which is not cured within 90 days notice, or upon 60 days notice, for the folate and PSMA licenses, in the event we fail to meet public demand for approved products covered by the licensed patents after a six month cure period following commercial introduction. The Purdue Research Foundation may terminate the license to other ligands if we fail to make a payment within 60 days of notice under the specific terms of the license. The folate and PSMA licenses also contain provisions allowing Purdue Research Foundation to terminate upon our bankruptcy. We have annual minimum royalty obligations to Purdue Research Foundation, as well as royalty obligations based on sales of products that are designed, developed or tested using the licensed technology, and milestone obligations based upon the achievement of specific scientific, clinical and regulatory milestones. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Contractual Obligations and Commitments for a description of our payment obligations under the license agreements with the Purdue Research Foundation.
     Most of our portfolio consists of intellectual property we exclusively license from Purdue Research Foundation or which we own ourselves. Generally, the intellectual property licensed from Purdue Research Foundation is early stage and relates to methods that were invented in the laboratory of Professor Philip Low. Internally, we typically develop 

 
  23

 
these methods further and refine them to determine the commercial applicability. Additionally, these early-stage patents often provide us protection from competitors while we evaluate commercial possibilities of a specific program. For example, some of the very early patents we licensed from Purdue Research Foundation covered methods of delivering folate attached to targeting ligand across a cell membrane. We were able to use the patent protection afforded by such early patents to develop folate conjugates, including the invention and clinical development, and in the future, the potential commercialization of our linker system incorporated in vintafolide.
     Due to the use of federal funds in the development of some folate-related technology, the U.S. government has the irrevocable, royalty-free, paid-up right to practice and have practiced certain patents throughout the world, should it choose to exercise such rights.
     Our development strategy also employs lifecycle management positions. For example, we explore the potential for filing patent applications claiming methods of treatment combining our molecules with other treatments. Such strategies may provide additional patent protection even after the expiration of composition of matter patent protection for our intellectual property. As a result, our general guiding strategy is to obtain patent coverage for innovations that show a clinical benefit to patients and an economic opportunity for us.
     In addition, in October 2007, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license with R&D Biopharmaceuticals to research, develop, and commercialize products containing conjugates of folate receptor targeting compounds and tubulysin compounds. In February 2011, this licensing agreement was assigned by R&D Biopharmaceuticals to Trientlgasse.
     Pursuant to a license agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, we co-own several patent applications directed to epothilone with BMS. BMS notified us of their intent to terminate our license agreement in June 2010 and in July 2010 also notified us of their intent to abandon certain of the patent applications subject to the license related to folate conjugates with epothilone.
     The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent.
     The patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent.
     The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-U.S. jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products.
     While we pursue patent protection and enforcement of our SMDC candidates and aspects of our technologies when appropriate, we also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancement to develop and maintain our competitive position. To protect this competitive position, we regularly enter into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with third parties, including employees, independent contractors, suppliers and collaborators. Our employment policy requires each new employee to enter into an agreement containing provisions generally prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of us and providing that any invention conceived by an employee within the scope of his or her employment duties is our exclusive property. We have a similar policy with respect to independent contractors, generally requiring independent contractors to enter into an agreement containing provisions generally prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of us and providing that any invention conceived by an independent contractor within the scope of his or her services is our 

 
  24

 
exclusive property, with the exception of contracts with universities and colleges that may be unable to make such assignments. Furthermore, our know-how that is accessed by third parties through collaborations and research and development contracts and through our relationships with scientific consultants is generally protected through confidentiality agreements with the appropriate parties. We cannot, however, assure you that these protective arrangements will be honored by third parties, including employees, independent contractors, suppliers and collaborators, or that these arrangements will effectively protect our rights relating to unpatented proprietary information, trade secrets and know-how. In addition, we cannot assure you that other parties will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our proprietary information and technologies.
     Additionally, there can be no assurance that our patents will provide significant protection, competitive advantage or commercial benefit. The validity and enforceability of patents issued to biopharmaceutical companies has proven highly uncertain. For example, legal considerations surrounding the validity of patents in the fields of biopharmaceuticals are in transition, and we cannot assure you that the historical legal standards surrounding questions of validity will continue to be applied or that current defenses relating to issued patents in these fields will be sufficient in the future. In addition, we cannot assure you as to the degree and range of protections any of our patents, if issued, may afford us or whether patents will be issued. For example, patents which may issue to us may be subjected to further governmental review that may ultimately result in the reduction of their scope of protection, and pending patent applications may have their requested breadth of protection significantly limited before being issued, if issued at all. Further, since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot assure you that we were the first creator of inventions covered by our pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions.
     Many biopharmaceutical companies and university and research institutions have filed patent applications or have received patents in our areas of product development. Many of these entities’ applications, patents and other intellectual property rights could prevent us from obtaining patents or could call into question the validity of any of our patents, if issued, or could otherwise adversely affect our ability to develop, manufacture or commercialize SMDC candidates. In addition, certain parts of our technology originated from third-party sources. These third-party sources include academic, government and other research laboratories, as well as the public domain. If use of technology incorporated into or used to produce our SMDCs is challenged, or if a conflicting patent issued to others is upheld in the courts or if a conflicting patent application filed by others is issued as a patent and is upheld, we may be unable to market one or more of our SMDCs, or we may be required to obtain a license to market those SMDCs. To contend with these possibilities, we may have to enter into license agreements in the future with third parties for technologies that may be useful or necessary for the manufacture or commercialization of some of our SMDCs. In addition, we are routinely in discussions with academic and commercial entities that hold patents on technology or processes that we may find necessary in order to engage in some of our activities. However, we cannot assure you that these licenses, or any others that we may be required to obtain to market our SMDCs, will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that we will be able to develop alternative technologies if we cannot obtain required licenses.
     To protect our rights to any of our issued patents and proprietary information, we may need to litigate against infringing third parties, or avail ourselves of the courts or participate in hearings to determine the scope and validity of those patents or other proprietary rights. These types of proceedings are often costly and could be very time-consuming to us, and we cannot assure you that the deciding authorities will rule in our favor. An unfavorable decision could allow third parties to use our technology without being required to pay us licensing fees or may compel us to license needed technologies to avoid infringing third-party patent and proprietary rights, or even could result in the invalidation or a limitation in the scope of our patents or forfeiture of the rights associated with our patents or pending patent applications. Although we believe that we would have valid defenses to allegations that our current SMDCs, production methods and other activities infringe the valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of any third parties, we cannot be certain that a third party will not challenge our position in the future. Even if some of these activities were found to infringe a third party’s patent rights, we may be found to be exempt from infringement under 35 U.S.C. §271(e) to the extent that these are found to be pre-commercialization activities related to our seeking regulatory approval for a SMDC. However, the scope of protection under 35 U.S.C. §271(e) is uncertain and we cannot assure you that any defense under 35 U.S.C. §271(e) would be successful. Further, the defense under 35 U.S.C. §271(e) is only available for pre-commercialization activities, and could not be used as a defense for sale and marketing of any of our SMDCs. There has been, and we 

 
  25

 
believe that there will continue to be, significant litigation in the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries regarding patent and other intellectual property rights.
