Item 1. | Business

Overview
The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (“Dun & Bradstreet” or “we” or “us” or “our” or the “Company”) grows the most valuable relationships in business. By uncovering truth and meaning from data, we connect customers with the prospects, suppliers, clients and partners that matter most, and have since 1841. Nearly ninety percent of the Fortune 500, and companies of every size around the world, rely on our data, insights and analytics.
Dun & Bradstreet® is the world’s leading source of commercial data, analytics and insight on businesses. Our global commercial database as of December 31, 2016 contained approximately 265 million business records. We transform commercial data into valuable insight which is the foundation of our global solutions that customers rely on to make critical business decisions.
Dun & Bradstreet provides solution sets that meet a diverse set of customer needs globally. Customers use Risk Management Solutions™ to mitigate credit, compliance and supplier risk, increase cash flow and drive increased profitability, and Sales & Marketing Solutions™ to better use data to grow sales and improve marketing effectiveness and also for data management capabilities that provide effective and cost efficient marketing solutions to increase revenue from new and existing customers.
Our Strategy 
Dun & Bradstreet’s strategy is to become one global company delivering indispensable content through modern channels to serve new customer needs with our forward-leaning culture. We remain focused on the commercial marketplace and continuing to be the world’s largest and best provider of insight about businesses.  Our strategy is designed to drive long term sustainable growth in the years ahead and we remain committed to increasing Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) through revenue growth.
Our strategy has five key components: 

• | First, we are globalizing the business, moving from a regional structure to an integrated global organization. As part of this transformation we intend to expand upon our relationships with our large, strategic customers, many of which also have global operations, while servicing them as global accounts. We are also creating global, cloud-based solutions, to service our customers. This globalization of our business will be closely integrated with our Worldwide Network® partners. For example, in 2016, we shifted our businesses based in the Latin America and Benelux regions to a Worldwide Network partner model in support of our global data strategy and customer-centric approach built on having the best data in every market; 


• | Second, we are investing in content, which includes our data and analytics, that is indispensable to our customers’ growth. We are improving the quality and consistency of our data around the globe, developing new analytic tools and scores to improve the predictive capability of our content, cultivating new proprietary data sources and acquiring companies and other third-party sources of data to combine with our existing data;


• | Third, we are modernizing content delivery by transitioning from older, traditional platforms to more agile cloud-based and Data-as-a-Service (or “DaaS”) approaches leveraging Application Programming Interface (“API”) connectors, and focusing on alliance and third-party distribution in addition to our own products;


• | Fourth, we have modernized the brand. Building on our modernized brand efforts the year prior, we unveiled in 2016 a reimagined, data-driven, content-led digital experience for our customers, and made significant investments in our persona-based go-to-market strategy; and


• | Fifth, we are creating an outside-in, forward-leaning culture with a team that is externally focused, and plugged into our customers’ needs and the markets in which we operate.

The strategy is built on the valuable assets the Company possesses today that we believe provide a competitive advantage for Dun & Bradstreet:

• | Well Recognized Brand


• | Superior Content and Solutions


• | Loyal Customers

For the reasons described below, we believe that these core competitive advantages will enable successful execution of our strategy going forward.
Well Recognized Brand 
Dun & Bradstreet has benefitted for over 175 years from a respected and well-recognized brand in the marketplace. We’ve exhibited an unmatched ability to help customers achieve their objectives through the use of data and analytics. To bring this to life, Dun & Bradstreet revealed a modernized brand, purpose and values in March 2015. This was both an internal culture update - increasing generous people policies, consistent and transparent employee communications, and well-designed, collaborative office spaces - as well as an external expression of the modernized Dun & Bradstreet.“Dun & Bradstreet grows the most valuable relationships in business by uncovering truth and meaning from data” is our guiding purpose, grounded in the understanding that growing strong relationships through data empowers our customers’ success. Dun & Bradstreet expanded its brand modernization in April 2016 with a focused effort to drive thought-leadership across industries, and by unveiling a reimagined digital experience on DNB.com in the United States (“U.S.”) and on DNB.co.uk in the United Kingdom.  Through these data-fueled, content-led sites, our new digital experience better reflects and augments the brand, connecting a customer’s online and offline interactions with Dun & Bradstreet, and demonstrating the breadth and depth of our expertise. Utilizing tools such as Web Visitor ID, DNB.com destinations provide the most relevant content to viewers, resulting in fully-customizable user experiences, increased engagement, robust lead-generation and full-funnel stewardship. Additionally, we refined our persona-based go-to-market strategy in 2016 to continually deliver solutions - through a myriad of customer touchpoints - tailored to specific needs, both for existing and potential new customers. Feedback has shown that customers now associate our brand with a company that is modern, data-inspired and useful, while employees have become more inspired by and proud of the brand. We believe that a modern, data-inspired, humanized brand is an important part of the Company’s growth strategy overall.
Superior Content and Solutions
Risk Management Solutions
Risk Management Solutions is our largest customer solution set, accounting for 59%, 60% and 61% of our total revenue, exclusive of businesses we no longer operate, for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Our Risk Management Solutions help customers increase cash flow and profitability while mitigating credit, operational and regulatory risks by helping them answer questions such as:

• | Should I extend credit to this new customer?


• | Should I do business with this entity?


• | What credit limit should I set?


• | Will this customer pay me on time?


• | How can I avoid supply chain disruption?


• | How do I know whether I am in compliance with regulatory acts?

Our principal Risk Management Solutions are:

• | DNBi® and D&B Credit®, subscription-based online applications that offer customers real time access to our most complete and up-to-date global information, comprehensive monitoring and portfolio analysis;


• | Our credit building and credibility solutions for emerging businesses, which provide, among other solutions, a credit monitoring solution to companies looking to monitor and impact their own business credit profile, offered through our Emerging Businesses division;

• | Various business information reports (e.g., Business Information Report, Comprehensive Report, and Global Report, etc.) that are consumed in a transactional manner across multiple platforms such as DNB.com;


• | Our Compliance product suite which includes Onboard and Compliance Check, online applications that help customers comply with Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer requirements and global anti-bribery and corruption regulations through advanced screening and monitoring of customers and third-party vendors;


• | Supplier Risk Manager, an online application that helps businesses mitigate supply chain risk by certifying and onboarding suppliers, monitoring including alerts, and portfolio analysis; and


• | Products that are part of our DaaS strategy, which integrate our content directly into the applications and platforms that our customers use every day. This includes D&B Direct®, an API that enables data integration inside Enterprise applications such as Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”), and enables master data management and Toolkit.

Certain solutions are available on a subscription pricing basis, including our DNBi and D&B Credit subscription pricing plans. Our subscription pricing plans represent a larger portion of our revenue and provide increased access to our risk management reports and data to help customers increase their profitability while mitigating their risk.
Sales & Marketing Solutions
Sales & Marketing Solutions accounted for 41%, 40% and 39% of our total revenue, exclusive of businesses we no longer operate, for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Our Sales & Marketing Solutions help customers increase revenue from new and existing customers by helping them answer questions such as:

• | Who are my best customers?


• | How can I find prospects that look like my best customers?


• | How can I capture untapped opportunities with my existing customers?


• | How can I allocate sales force resources to revenue growth potential?


• | How can I ensure my data on customers is accurate, up to date and robust?


• | Who are the best contacts at a business for my services?


• | How can I target the right audience with online advertising?

Our principal Sales & Marketing Solutions are:

• | Our customer data management solutions, which are solutions that cleanse, identify, link and enrich customer and contact information. Our D&B Optimizer™ solution, for example, transforms our customers’ prospects and data into up-to-date, accurate and actionable commercial insight, facilitating a single customer view across multiple systems and touchpoints, such as marketing and billing databases, and better enables a customer to make sales and marketing decisions;


• | Various other marketing solutions including our education business, our electronic licensing products, and our Integration Manager product which is an onsite match tool that leverages Dun & Bradstreet match technology to enable customers to perform onsite matching on Dun & Bradstreet data, customer data and third-party data;


• | Hoover’s®, which is primarily a traditional prospecting solution, provides information on public and private companies, and on industries and executives, sales, marketing and research professionals worldwide to help customers convert prospects to clients faster by providing a workflow solution. In January 2017, we acquired Avention, Inc., which we believe will help us evolve Hoover’s and our traditional prospecting solutions into Sales Acceleration products. These enhanced offerings feature more actionable information through capabilities such as news alerts and prescriptive triggers, as well as more robust integrations of data and analytics across enterprise platforms;

• | Products leveraging our next generation API’s such as Direct Plus and our rapidly growing “as a Service” offerings, including D&B Credit, which is entirely cloud based. In addition, we have strategic alliances with leading third-party application providers, including Salesforce.com® and Oracle®, whereby our content is natively integrated into the solution. The vision for DaaS is to make Dun & Bradstreet’s content available wherever and whenever our customers need it, thereby powering more effective business processes;


• | Our Market Insight tool, which provides robust marketing analytics that help customers segment and understand existing customers, in order to more effectively create campaigns to cross-sell new business; and


• | Our new Audience Solutions suite of products, which are tailored towards the shifting dynamics of the B2B marketing space from traditional to digital. This set of products enables advertisers and companies to intelligently target professionals in multiple ways via the insight created by our company and contact data.

Loyal Customers
In the fourth quarter of 2015, we brought together the majority of our customer-facing, go-to-market activities into segments called, “Lines of Business,” which created a more focused approach to serving customers. This created a strong alignment between product and solutions and how we go to market. 
We continue to serve our customers through a multi-channel sales organization, which is centered around three key areas: our Global Direct sales channel, Alliances and Emerging Businesses.
This structure creates better alignment with product and solutions, and how they work more closely with our go to market channels. This more aligned, integrated approach will enable us to be more agile and effective in the marketplace and help us to serve our customers efficiently and effectively.
We support principal customers across communications, technology, government, strategic financial services and retail/telecommunications/manufacturing across our sales channels. None of our customers accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue in any of the past three fiscal years.
We utilize the Net Promoter Score (“NPS”), which is the global standard for measuring customer loyalty, to evaluate our customer engagement and satisfaction and to help us improve upon the customer experience.
Segments 
Since January 1, 2015, we have managed and reported our business through two segments:

• | Americas, which currently consists of our operations in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada, and our Latin America Worldwide Network (we divested our Latin America operations in September 2016); and


• | Non-Americas, which currently consists of our operations in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), Greater China, India and our European and Asia Pacific Worldwide Networks (we divested our operations in both the Netherlands and Belgium in November 2016 and our Australian operations in June 2015).

Prior to January 1, 2015, we managed and reported our business through the following three segments:

• | North America, which consisted of our operations in the U.S. and Canada;


• | Asia Pacific, which primarily consisted of our operations in Australia, Greater China, India and Asia Pacific Worldwide Network; and


• | Europe and other International Markets, which primarily consisted of our operations in the U.K., the Netherlands, Belgium, Latin America, and our European Worldwide Network.

The following table presents the contribution by segment to revenue (See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K):

 | For the Years Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Revenue: | | | | | 
Americas | 83 | % | | 81 | % | 80 | %
Non-Americas | 17 | % | | 19 | % | 20 | %

We may also acquire, divest, or shut down businesses from time to time. For example:

• | In January 2017, we acquired Avention, Inc.;


• | In 2016, we completed the sales of our businesses in Benelux (the Netherlands and Belgium) and Latin America, converting these businesses to our Worldwide Network model; and


• | In 2015, we:


▪ | Acquired NetProspex, Inc. and Dun & Bradstreet Credibility Corp. (“DBCC”); and


▪ | Completed the sale of our businesses in Australia and New Zealand (“ANZ”).

Segment data and other information for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are included in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As our strategy evolves, we may modify our reporting structure, as appropriate, to reflect changes in the way we manage our business.
We also report and monitor the performance of our Risk Management Solutions as Trade Credit and Other Enterprise Risk Management, and the results of our Sales & Marketing Solutions as Traditional Prospecting Solutions and Advanced Marketing Solutions. Trade Credit represents our traditional commercial credit products such as DNBi (which includes D&B Credit) and all other products that help customers assess payment risk. Other Enterprise Risk Management includes all of our remaining Risk Management products, such as our compliance, supply chain, credit on self and D&B Direct risk solutions. Traditional Prospecting Solutions includes Hoover’s and our educational marketing business Market Data Retrieval (“MDR”). Advanced Marketing Solutions includes all of our remaining Sales & Marketing Solutions products including Optimizer, NetProspex and DaaS (e.g., CRM and D&B Direct sales and marketing solutions). 
Our Direct Sales Force 
Our direct sales force consists of approximately 1,700 team members worldwide, of whom approximately 1,300 were in our Americas and 400 were in our Non-Americas business as of December 31, 2016. Our sales force includes enterprise sales executives and customer solution specialists who sell to our vertically aligned strategic customers and our geographically aligned national commercial customers, a telesales team that sells to our small- and medium-sized customers, and a team that sells to federal, state and local governments.
Our Alliances and the Dun & Bradstreet Worldwide Network
In addition, we have sales teams who are dedicated specifically to our alliance partners. These teams are focused around: (i) alliance partners to whom we are a major supplier of data, which they specifically request and leverage as content to enhance their own products and services for sale to their customers; and (ii) alliance partners who enable the seamless delivery of our data, regardless of the content, to enable their end users to consume our content in a flexible, user friendly manner.
We also conduct business through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, majority-owned joint ventures, independent correspondents, strategic relationships through our Worldwide Network and minority equity investments. Our Worldwide Network is an alliance of network partners covering more than 220 countries. In those countries, we have determined it is beneficial to engage with dominant, well known local partners to enable us to better collect data from such countries and to better sell our existing content into such countries. Our Worldwide Network enables our customers globally to make business decisions with confidence, because we incorporate data from the members of the Worldwide Network into our database and utilize it in our customer solutions. Our customers, therefore, have access to a more powerful database and global solution sets that they can rely on to make their business decisions.

Competition
We are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. However, we believe no competitor offers our complete line of solutions, global data breadth and consistency, analytic capabilities and multi-channel approach for commercial entities and the people who run them.
In North America, we are a market leader in our Risk Management Solutions business based upon revenue. We compete with our customers’ own internal business practices by continually developing more efficient alternatives to our customers’ risk management processes to capture more of their internal spend. We also directly compete with a broad range of companies, including consumer credit companies such as Equifax, Inc. (“Equifax®”) and Experian Information Solutions, Inc. (“Experian®”), as well as a number of low cost, vertical and regionally specific companies. In addition, competitors with unique assets and capabilities outside of commercial data create bundled offerings which are attractive to certain customer segments.
We also compete in North America with a broad range of companies offering solutions similar to our Sales & Marketing Solutions. Our direct competitors in Sales & Marketing Solutions vary significantly depending on the many possible uses for our solutions such as market segmentation, lead generation, lead enrichment, sales effectiveness, and data management. We also face competition in data services from our customers’ own internal development and from data quality software solutions.
Outside the U.S., the competitive environment varies by region and country, and can be significantly impacted by the legislative actions of local governments, availability of data and local business preferences.
In the U.K. and Ireland, our direct competition is primarily from Experian and Bureau van Dijk®. We believe that we offer superior solutions when compared to these competitors. In addition, the Sales & Marketing Solutions landscape in these markets is both localized and fragmented, where numerous local players of varying size compete for business.
In Asia Pacific, we face competition in our Risk Management Solutions business from a mix of local and global providers. For example, we compete with Experian in India and with Sinotrust International Information & Consulting (Beijing) Co., Ltd. in China, which is owned by Experian. In addition, as in the U.K., the Sales & Marketing Solutions landscape throughout Asia is localized and fragmented.
We also face significant competition from the in-house operations of the businesses we seek as customers, other general and specialized credit reporting and business information services, and credit insurers. In addition, business information solutions and services are becoming more readily available, principally due to the expansion of the Internet, greater availability of public data and the emergence of new providers of business information solutions and services.
We believe that our trusted brand, proprietary data assets, global identity resolution knowledge, globally recognized D-U-N-S® Number and analytic capabilities form a powerful competitive advantage.
Our ability to continue to compete effectively will be based on a number of factors, including our ability to:

• | Communicate and demonstrate to our customers the value of our existing and new products and services based upon our proprietary data, and as a result, improve customer satisfaction;


• | Maintain and develop our proprietary D-U-N-S® numbering classification system and information and services such as analytics and sources of data not publicly available;


• | Leverage our technology to significantly improve our value proposition for customers in order to make Dun & Bradstreet’s data available wherever and whenever our customers need it, as well as our brand perception and the value of our Worldwide Network;


• | Maintain those third-party relationships on whom we rely for data and certain operational services; and


• | Attract and retain a high-performing workforce.

Intellectual Property 
We own and control various intellectual property rights, such as trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights, patents and applications to the foregoing. These rights, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business. We also believe that the Dun & Bradstreet name and related trade names, marks and logos are of material importance to our business. We are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others, and other companies are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us. We consider our trademarks, service marks, databases, software, copyrights, patents, patent applications 
8

and other intellectual property to be proprietary, and we rely on a combination of statutory (e.g., copyright, trademark, trade secret, patent, etc.) and contract and liability safeguards for protecting them throughout the world.
Unless the context indicates otherwise, the names of our branded solutions and services referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are common law or registered trademarks or service marks owned by or licensed to us or one or more of our subsidiaries.
We own patents and patent applications both in the U.S. and in other selected countries of importance to us. The patents and patent applications include claims which pertain to certain technologies and inventions which we have determined are proprietary and warrant patent protection. We believe that the protection of our innovative technology and inventions, such as our proprietary methods for data curation and identity resolution, through the filing of patent applications, is a prudent business strategy, and we will continue to seek to protect those certain assets for which we have expended substantial capital or otherwise deem to provide a competitive advantage. Filing of these patent applications may or may not provide us with a dominant position in the fields of technology. However, these patents and/or patent applications may provide us with legal defenses should subsequent patents in these fields be issued to third parties and later asserted against us. Where appropriate, we may also consider asserting or cross-licensing our patents.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 4,800 employees worldwide, of whom approximately 3,400 were in our Americas segment and Corporate, and approximately 1,400 were in our Non-Americas segments. Our workforce also engages third-party consultants as an ongoing part of our business where appropriate. There are no unions in our U.S. or Canada operations, and works councils and trade unions represent a small portion of our employees outside of the U.S. and Canada. 
We know we must have a passionate, forward-leaning culture to support our growth strategy and brand. Toward that end, we are implementing our long-term plan to attract and retain top talent, deliver modern learning and development programs and diversity initiatives and transform Dun & Bradstreet’s culture through creative initiatives, modern systems and leading practices. 
In 2016, we launched a number of key people initiatives including, among others:

• | We adopted a competency-based interview model across the organization, relaunched our career website which improved user experience, and customized email outreach by functional area, all in order to better attract and retain top talent.


• | We delivered modern learning and development programs and diversity initiatives, such as the launch of an Executive Edge for Women Class, discussions held globally regarding talent profile and succession planning, enhanced participation in our Global Learning and Development programs, and the launch of our third CEO Leadership Experience Class.


• | We continue to transform our culture through creative initiatives, modern systems and leading practices, including the launch of Workday, our first global People Technology solution, continued Ampersand Awards recognition to team members who embody our values, and continuous Sustainable High Performance efforts throughout the year.

Our Board of Directors is committed to helping our cultural transformation and we actively engage with them around our cultural initiatives which we expect to roll out continuously in future years, commensurate with our growth as a company.
