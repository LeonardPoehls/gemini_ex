DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND RECENT HISTORY
 
General
 
Sky Resort International Limited (“the Company”), formerly known as Gold Billion Group Holdings Limited, was incorporated in Delaware on November 9, 2000 under the name of Hotel Outsource Management International, Inc.
 
The Company used to be a service provider in the hospitality industry, supplying a range of services in relation to computerized minibars that are primarily intended for in-room refreshments. However, no business has been generated since 5 September 2014 when all the subsidiaries have been disposed of. The company became dormant and has remained so until the date of this report.
 
On November 25, 2014 The Company approved and acknowledged a Stock Purchase Agreement, entered into by and between certain shareholders of the Company, as Sellers, and Richcorp Holdings Ltd., a Samoa corporation, as Buyer, pursuant to which the Buyer purchased from the Sellers a total of 2,308,345 shares of common stock in the Company. The parties closed the transaction contemplated in the Stock Purchase Agreement on November 25, 2014.
 
The Shares represent approximately 78.3% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock, and as a result, the transaction resulted in a change of control of the Company. Mr. Eddy Kok Seng Yeap owns 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Richcorp Holdings Ltd., and may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the Shares purchased by Richcorp Holdings Ltd.
 
In conjunction with the share purchase transaction between the Sellers and the Buyer, on November 25, 2014, Mr. Avraham Bahry, the Registrant’s sole officer and director, resigned from his respective positions as the President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. His resignation was not due to a disagreement with the Company. Mr. Bahry did not resign his position as a member of the board of directors.

On November 25, 2014, the board of directors of the Company appointed Mr. Eddy Kok Seng Yeap as both a director and as the President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Mr. Eddy Kok Seng Yeap does not have any employment agreements with the Company.
 
On July 29, 2015 the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which the Company merged with its wholly owned subsidiary, Gold Billion Group Holdings Limited, a Delaware corporation with no material operations ("Merger Sub" and such merger transaction, the "Merger"). Upon the consummation of the Merger, the separate existence of Merger Sub ceased and shareholders of the Company became shareholders of the surviving company named Gold Billion Group Holdings Limited.
 
As permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law Title 8, Section 251(f), the sole purpose of the Merger was to effect a change of the Company's name from Hotel Outsource Management International, Inc. to Gold Billion Group Holdings Limited. Upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of Delaware on July 30, 2015 to effect the Merger, the Company's Articles of Incorporation were deemed amended to reflect the change in the Company's corporate name.
 
On October 2, 2017,the Company filed a certificate of amendment to its articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware changing the Company’s name from Gold Billion Group Holdings Limited to “Sky Resort International Limited”. The name change became effective with FINRA on December 12, 2017.
 
On October 2, 2017, the Company filed a certificate of change with the Secretary of State of Delaware to effectuate a reverse stock split (the “Stock Split”) of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a 1-for-100 basis. The number of its authorized shares of common stock will remain at 200,000,000 shares, par value $0.001. The Stock Split became effective with FINRA on December 12, 2017 (the “Effective Date”). As of that date, every 100 shares of issued and outstanding common stock were converted into one share of common stock. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Stock Split. Instead, any fractional shares will be rounded up to the next whole share and a holder of record of old common stock on the Effective Date who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share will, in lieu thereof, be issued one whole share.
 
The reverse split will not change the proportionate equity interests of the Company’s stockholders, nor will the respective voting rights and other rights of stockholders be altered, except for possible immaterial changes, due to rounding-up any fractional shares. The Common Stock issued pursuant to the reverse split will remain fully paid and non-assessable. The reverse split is not intended as, and will not have the effect of, a "going private transaction" covered by Rule 13e-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company will continue to be subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
On December 21, 2017, Mr. Eddy Kok Seng Yeap resigned as director, chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company as part of the Company’s management reorganization. The resignation by the individual did not involve any disagreements with the Company or the management of the Company.

Business Plan
 
Our current business plan is to seek and identify appropriate business opportunity for development of our new line of business. We have no capital and must depend on the resources of our shareholders to provide us with the necessary funds to implement our business plan. We intend to seek opportunities demonstrating the potential of long-term growth as opposed to short-term earnings. However, at the present time, we have not identified any business opportunity that we plan to pursue, nor have we reached any agreement or definitive understanding with any person concerning an acquisition or merger.
 
Our sole director will be primarily responsible for investigating combination opportunities. However, we believe that business opportunities may also come to our attention from various sources, including professional advisors such as attorneys, and accountants, securities broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community, and others who may present unsolicited proposals. We have no plan, understanding, agreements, or commitments with any individual for such person to act as a finder of opportunities for us.
 
No direct discussions regarding the possibility of a combination are currently ongoing and we can give no assurances that we will be successful in finding or acquiring a desirable business opportunity. Furthermore, we can give no assurances that any acquisition, if it occurs, will be on terms that are favorable to us or our current stockholders.
 
We do not propose to restrict our search for business opportunity to any particular geographical area or industry, and therefore, we are unable to predict the nature of our future business operations. Our management’s discretion in the selection of business opportunities is unrestricted, subject to the availability of such opportunities, economic conditions, and other factors.
 
Investigation and Selection of Business Opportunities
 
Certain types of business acquisition transactions may be completed without requiring us to first submit the transaction to our stockholders for their approval. If the proposed transaction is structured in such a fashion our stockholders (other than our majority stockholder) will not be provided with financial or other information relating to the candidate prior to the completion of the transaction.
 
If a proposed business combination or business acquisition transaction is structured that requires our stockholder approval, and we are a reporting company, we will be required to provide our stockholders with information as applicable under Regulations 14A and 14C under the Exchange Act.
 
The analysis of business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our sole director. In analyzing potential merger candidates, our management will consider, among other things, the following factors:
 

- | Potential for future earnings and appreciation of value of securities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Perception of how any particular business opportunity will be received by the investment community and by our stockholders;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Historical results of operation;
--+---------------------------------


- | Liquidity and availability of capital resources;
--+-------------------------------------------------


- | Competitive position as compared to other companies of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Strength and diversity of existing management or management prospects that are scheduled for recruitment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Amount of debt and contingent liabilities; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


- | The products and/or services and marketing concepts of the target business.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no single factor that will be controlling in the selection of a business opportunity. Our management will attempt to analyze all factors appropriate to each opportunity and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities. We may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the business opportunity to be acquired.
 
We are unable to predict when we may participate in a business opportunity. We expect, however, that the analysis of specific proposals and the selection of a business opportunity may take several months.
 
Prior to making a decision to participate in a business transaction, we will generally request that we be provided with written materials regarding the business opportunity containing as much relevant information as possible, including, but not limited to, a description of products, services and company history; management resumes; financial information; available projections, with related assumptions upon which they are based; an explanation of proprietary products and services; evidence of existing patents, trademarks, or service marks, or rights thereto; present and proposed forms of compensation to management; a description of transactions between such company and its affiliates during the relevant periods; a description of present and required facilities; an analysis of risks and competitive conditions; a financial plan of operation and estimated capital requirements; audited financial statements, or if audited financial statements are not available, unaudited financial statements, together with reasonable assurance that audited financial statements would be able to be produced to comply with the requirements of a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or Commission, upon consummation of the business combination.
 
As part of our investigation, our directors may meet personally with management and key personnel, may visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis or verification of certain provided information, check references of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of our limited financial and management resources.
