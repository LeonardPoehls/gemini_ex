--------+---------

 General
  
 
 TOR Minerals International, Inc. (“TOR”, “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) is a global producer of high performance, specialty mineral products focused on product innovation and technical support.  Our specialty mineral products, which include flame retardant and smoke suppressant fillers, engineered fillers, and titanium dioxide (“TiO2”) color hybrid pigments, are designed for use in plastics, coatings, paints and catalysts applications, as well as a wide range of other industrial applications.  
  
 We were organized as a subsidiary of the Benilite Corporation of America (“Benilite”) in 1973. In 1980, the subsidiary was spun off to its shareholders.  In December 1988, the Company became a publicly owned company after completing a public offering of 1.38 million shares of its common stock.
  
 Effective February 23, 2018, our shares will be traded on the Pink Market, operated by OTC Markets Group (www.otcmarkets.com) under the ticker symbol TORM.
  
 As noted in the Company’s filing of Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 2, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the voluntary suspension of its duty to file reports with the SEC and the voluntary deregistration of its common stock.  These actions resulted in the Company’s common shares no longer being listed on the NASDAQ and the Company no longer being a reporting issuer to the SEC.  The Company was eligible to suspend its reporting obligations and deregister its common stock because there are fewer than 300 holders of record of the Company’s common stock.
  
 After careful consideration, the Board of Directors concluded that the costs associated with operating as a reporting company, and the attendant demands on management, were not justified by the limited benefits. In that regard, in the last several years, the volume of trading in the Company’s common stock has declined significantly, the public market has not offered liquidity for significant amounts of stock, and the stock often has not traded at all.
  
 The Company is unable to predict the precise cost savings that are expected to result from the decision to suspend its reporting obligations, but it believes such costs will be substantial. These include, but are not limited to, reduced costs arising from audits of financial statements; elimination of quarterly reviews by auditors of interim financial statements; elimination of costs associated with preparation and filing of Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and other reports, and of proxy statements; and elimination of stock exchange listing fees. In addition, the Company expects that some legal and accounting fees and corporate insurance costs should be reduced over time because of the elimination of required SEC reporting.
  
 Although the Company will no longer file reports with the SEC or be subject to rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market, for the foreseeable future it intends to continue making information available to shareholders and to observe corporate governance practices comparable to those which have existed in recent years. Specifically:
 


The Company intends to obtain and
make available to shareholders annual audited financial statements prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America, beginning with the statements for the year ending December 31,
2018.


The Company expects to make
available quarterly and annual financial statements of TOR Minerals
International, Inc. via the Company’s website at www.torminerals.com and via the OTC Markets’ website at www.otcmarkets.com under the trading symbol TORM.



The Company expects to continue to
hold an annual meeting of shareholders each year, but it anticipates not
distributing a proxy statement or soliciting proxies from shareholders.  Notice
of the meeting would be given to shareholders.


The Board of Directors of the
Company currently consists of six independent directors and one management
director.  Although it will not be under a legal requirement to do so, the
Company plans, for the foreseeable future, to maintain a majority of
independent directors on the Board and its Audit, Corporate Governance and
Compensation Committees.

 Global Headquarters
  We are headquartered in Corpus Christi, Texas, United States.  This location houses senior management, customer service, logistics, and corporate research and development/technical service laboratories.  Our financial and accounting functions also operate from this location.  Our principal offices in Corpus Christi are located at 722 Burleson Street, Corpus Christi, Texas 78402, and our telephone number is (361) 883-5591.  Our website is located at  www.torminerals.com.  Information contained in our website and links contained on our website are not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 United States (“U.S.”) Operations
  Our U.S. manufacturing plant, located in Corpus Christi, Texas, is situated on the north side of the Corpus Christi Ship Channel and has its own dock frontage at the plant.  We also utilize the Bulk Terminal, operated by the Port of Corpus Christi Authority (the “Port”), to discharge bulk shipments of barite from cargo vessels directly into trucks for delivery to our plant.  The site has its own railhead and easy access to major highways linking it to the rest of the United States and to Mexico.  Our products, HITOX®, BARTEX®, HALTEX®, OPTILOAD® and TIOPREM®, are all produced at this location.
 Asian Operations
  We acquired our Asian operation, TOR Minerals Malaysia, Sdn. Bhd. (“TMM”), in 2000.  Located in Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia, close to the port of Lumut, TMM produces HITOX and TIOPREM which are sold primarily in Asia and Europe.  The sales team and the quality assurance laboratory for Asia are located at the offices in Ipoh.
  
 In 2015, we made a strategic decision to take our Synthetic Rutile (“SR”) production capacity out of service.  SR is a precursor material used in the production of HITOX and TIOPREM.  We are currently supplementing our existing SR inventory with product produced by alternate sources.  By making this strategic move, we have reduced the cost of our SR and reduced our inventory levels during both 2017 and 2016.
  
 
 European Operations
  In 2001, we acquired our European operation, TOR Processing and Trade, B.V. (“TPT”), situated within reach of the major shipping port of Rotterdam. TPT, located in Hattem, The Netherlands, specializes in the manufacturing of premium alumina products ALUPREM® and BAYRPREM® for use worldwide.  Customer applications, quality assurance laboratory and support facilities for Europe are located in Hattem.  Our global headquarters in Texas provide customer service and shipping logistics for TPT’s North American customers.

 Our Products
  
 TOR and its subsidiaries operate in the business of mineral product manufacturing in three geographic segments.  All U.S. manufacturing is done at the facility located in Corpus Christi, Texas.  Foreign manufacturing is done by the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, TMM and TPT.  Our products are currently marketed in the United States and in more than 60 other countries.  We sell our products through a network of direct sales representatives employed by the Company and independent stocking distributors in the United States, as well as distributors and agents overseas.  Our sales representatives sell directly to end-users and provide technical support and market guidance for our independent distribution network.
  
 Below is a list of our current specialty mineral products and a brief description of the unique characteristics which lend to the high performance of these specialty products.
  
 
 ALUPREM
  Premium Alumina Trihydrate (“ATH”) and Boehmite (“AMH”) products are produced at our European operation and are designed for the most demanding worldwide applications. In-house engineered surface treatment is available for enhanced performance benefits. 
  
 ALUPREM TB and SR Boehmite alumina products are suitable for a broad range of applications including wire and cable, catalysts, high-tech polishing, coatings and pigments. Performance benefits include high temperature flame retardant, improved mechanical properties and scratch resistance, good resin compatibility and high brightness.
  
 ALUPREM XHL is specially designed ATH for “Extra High Loading” to meet more stringent flame retardant and smoke suppressant requirements for sheet molding compound (“SMC”), bulk molding compound (“BMC”), pultrusion and other thermoset composite applications. 
  
 ALUPREM TA Bayer and TG ultra-white / translucent grade ATH products are designed for color critical applications like solid surface and performance driven uses such as wire and cable. 
  
 HITOX
  HITOX (high grade TiO2) is a high quality, cost-effective, beige colored titanium dioxide pigment produced at both our U.S. and Asian operations. In products which require opacity and color, HITOX can reduce the amount of expensive organic and inorganic pigments as well as white TiO2. HITOX is used in a broad range of paint and coatings and plastics applications including architectural, coil backers, powder, container, wood, traffic, paper, primers, adhesive and sealants, roof coatings and PVC.
 BARTEX and BARYPREM
  High whiteness and brightness, chemical inertness and controlled particle sizing are features of BARTEX. Barium Sulfate’s high density is one of the primary reasons it is used as a pigment. Suitable for use in both acid and basic conditions, BARTEX gives weight and body to products ranging from powder coatings to rubber products and plastics. BARTEX is also used as an extender pigment in top coats and primers.
 OPTILOAD
  OPTILOAD ATH, specially developed for “Optimum Loading”, offers a halogen-free solution for passing the most stringent flame retardant and smoke suppressant requirements. With increasing legislative concerns over smoke and toxicity associated with older halogenated systems, interest in re-formulation with OPTILOAD is growing.  Produced at our U.S. operation, the low viscosity OPTILOAD series offers high performance in a wide range of thermoset composite applications including SMC, BMC, pultrusion, resin infusion and spray-up / hand lay-up. 
 HALTEX
  HALTEX ATH is an economical, non-toxic, flame retardant and smoke suppressant filler produced at our U.S. operation for supply to the North American market. HALTEX features tightly controlled particle sizing to meet specific application performance requirements. Quality is suitable for a broad range of uses including electrical components, SMC, BMC, adhesives and sealants, roof coatings, foam insulation and rubber mining belts.

------------

 TIOPREM 
 TIOPREM is a high performance TiO2  colored hybrid pigment produced at both the U.S. and Asian operations. TIOPREM offers excellent heat stability making it suitable for use in high temperature resins and coatings. Typical applications are plastic master batch, color concentrates and liquid color. TIOPREM exhibits good opacity and is cost-effective in formulation, partially replacing more expensive heat stable pigments as well as white TiO2.
 Raw Materials and Energy
  
 We utilize a variety of raw materials in the manufacturing of our products.  Outlined below are the principal raw materials for TOR’s products.
  
 ALUPREM:  Alumina trihydrate, the chief raw material for ALUPREM, is manufactured throughout the world including Europe and North America.  The ATH material used for chemicals, fillers and flame-retardants is produced by the Bayer alumina process.  This grade of ATH accounts for approximately 95% of the total ATH produced worldwide.  The Company purchases ATH from various suppliers in Europe.  The average prices for ATH remained stable in 2017.
  
 BARTEX / BARYPREM:  High grade barites (barium sulfate) are mined in China, India, Turkey and Mexico and are the raw materials used to produce our BARTEX and BARYPREM product lines.  The average price for this grade of barites remained stable in 2017.  The availability of finer grade barites in China are declining, which could lead to higher prices in the future.  
  
 HALTEX / OPTILOAD:  Bayer grade aluminum hydroxide, used to produce HALTEX, is purchased from a supplier located overseas.  The average price for the Bayer grade aluminum hydroxide increased in 2017 as the majority of U.S. suppliers located near the Gulf of Mexico stopped production in 2016 which decreased U.S. supply and had a negative impact on our pricing structure.
  
 HITOX / TIOPREM:  Historically, SR, the primary raw material used in the production of our HITOX and TIOPREM, was manufactured at TMM.  However, during the later part of 2014 and 2015, we secured two alternate sources of SR and discontinued manufacturing our own SR.  As a result of this strategic move, the average price of SR was reduced in 2016 and remained stable in 2017.  We anticipate the cost to remain stable throughout the next year.
  
 ENERGY:  We are highly dependent on energy in our manufacturing processes.  Electricity is the predominant source of energy at each of our three operations and we also utilize natural gas as a source of energy at our U.S. and European operations.  At our plant in Corpus Christi, the average price of electricity was flat in 2017 and the average price of natural gas increased 6% in 2017.  At our plant in The Netherlands, the average price for electricity decreased 22% and the average price of natural gas decreased 9%; and, at TMM, the average price for electricity remained flat in 2017.
  
 
 Research and Development / Technical Services
  
 Our expenditures for research and development and technical services were approximately $200,000 in 2017.  We conduct our research and technical service primarily at our facilities in Corpus Christi and The Netherlands, and our efforts are principally focused on process technology, product development and technical service to our customers.  There are no research and development costs borne directly by our customers.

 Marketing and Customers
  
 Sales and Marketing Department Organization
  TOR’s sales efforts are managed out of Corpus Christi, Texas, by our Executive Vice President.  We have sales offices at our U.S., Asian and European operations.  Area and product managers report to the Executive Vice President and assist with customer, agent and distributor relations.
 Independent Distributors and Agents
  We utilize a network of both domestic and foreign independent distributors and agents.  Within North America there are multiple agents serving us on either a regional or a product basis.  In most other countries there is one stocking distributor who purchases directly from TOR and resells in their territory.  In certain large countries there may be multiple distributors.  Our use of domestic and foreign distributors and agents allows us to have the benefit of sales specialists with specific trade knowledge in each country.
Customers
  Our end-use customers include companies in the paints, coatings and plastics, as well as other industries.  For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, one of our customers, BASF, represented 14% and 24%, respectively, of our total consolidated sales.
 Geographic Distribution
  We sell our products globally and market them in North, Central and South America, Asia and Europe to customers located in more than 60 countries.  For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our foreign sales in Germany represented 19% and 22%, respectively, and Italy represented 7% and 10%, respectively.  Sales to external customers are attributed to geographic area based on the country of distribution.
  
 A summary of the Company’s sales by geographic area is presented below:
  
 
(In thousands) | | 2017 | 2016 
-----------------------------------------+---+---------------+-----------------
Summary by Geographic Area | | Sales Revenue | % of Total Sales | | Sales Revenue | % of Total Sales
United States | $ | 20,630 | 53% | $ | 23,836 | 62% 
Canada, Mexico & South/Central America | | 3,067 | 8% | | 2,608 | 7% 
Pacific Rim | | 3,678 | 9% | | 2,418 | 6% 
Europe, Africa & Middle East | | 11,591 | 30% | | 9,594 | 25% 
Total Sales | $ | 38,966 | 100% | $ | 38,456 | 100% 

 Competition
  We experience competition with respect to each of our products.  In order to maintain and grow sales volumes, we must rely on our ability to innovate, to add value, as well as to manufacture and distribute products at competitive prices.  We believe that quality, delivery on schedule and price are the principal competitive factors.  Due to the nature and the size of our company as compared to others in the industry, we are not price leaders, but are price followers.  While we generally attempt to increase prices to offset cost increases, these actions tend to lag the cost increases.
  
 Our competitors range from large corporations with a full line of production capabilities and products to small local firms specializing in one or two products.  More recently we have faced competition from a large number of Chinese suppliers.  A number of these competitors are owned and operated by large diversified corporations, such as Kronos, Inc., the Chemours Company and J.M. Huber.  They have substantially greater financial and other resources, and their share of industry sales is substantially larger than ours.
  
 
 Environmental Regulations and Product Safety
  
 Our plant in Corpus Christi is subject to regulations promulgated by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and state and local authorities with respect to the discharge of substances into the environment.  We believe that the Corpus Christi plant is in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, and we do not expect that any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities will be necessary in order to continue such compliance.

 TMM's SR plant is required to be licensed by the Malaysian Atomic Energy Licensing Board ("AELB") as the ilmenite previously used by the plant’s SR production is derived from tin tailings and may contain small amounts of monazite and hafnium, which are radioactive rare earth compounds.  The monitoring is done in-house by TMM personnel and results are reported to the AELB as required.  TMM is also currently in compliance with various other licensing and permitting requirements.
  
 TPT operates an alumina processing plant in Hattem, The Netherlands, and is governed by rules promulgated by both The Netherlands and the European Community.  We believe that the Hattem plant is in compliance with all applicable environmental and safety regulations.
  
 
 Backlog
  
 We normally manufacture our products in anticipation of, and not in response to, customer orders and generally fill orders within a short time after receipt.  Consequently, we seek to maintain adequate inventories of our products in order to permit us to fill orders promptly after receipt.  As of March 13, 2018, we did not have a significant backlog of customer orders.
 Seasonality
  
 Our business is closely correlated with the construction industry and its demand for materials that use pigments, such as paints and plastics.  This has generally led to higher sales in our second and third quarters due to increases in construction and maintenance during warmer weather.  Also, pigment consumption is closely correlated with general economic conditions.  When the economy is in an expansionary state, there is typically an increase in pigment consumption, while a slowdown in the economy typically results in decreased pigment consumption.  When the construction industry or the economy is in a period of decline, TOR's sales and profits are likely to be adversely affected.
 Patents and Trademarks
  
 We currently hold no patents on the processes for manufacturing any of our products.  Seven of TOR’s products, HITOX (4/30/2025), ALUPREM (7/29/2023), HALTEX (7/28/2019), BARTEX (2/24/2027), TIOPREM (8/5/2018), OPTILOAD (10/27/2019), and BARYPREM (8/31/2026), are marketed under names which have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  Expiration dates are shown in parenthetical phrases following each product in the preceding sentence.  Trademarks are also registered in certain foreign countries.
 Employees
  
 As of December 31, 2017, our U.S. operations had 45 full-time employees, our European operation had 45 employees, and our Asian operation had 35 employees, of which 9 are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with an in-house union.  We have not experienced any work stoppages and believe that our relations with all of our employees are good.

Item 1 A. | Risk Factors
------------+-------------

  
 In addition to the factors discussed in the “Forward-Looking Statement” at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.  In addition, you should know that the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face.  Unforeseen risks could arise and problems or issues that we now view as minor could become more significant.  If we were unable to adequately respond to any risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  Additionally, we cannot be certain or give any assurances that any actions taken to reduce known risks or uncertainties will be successful.
  
 Risks Related to Our Business
  
 We are a company with operations around the world and are exposed to general economic, political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we have operations and customers.
  
 We operate globally and have customers in many countries. Our production facilities are located in North America, Europe and Asia. Our principal customers are similarly global in scope and the prices of our most significant products are typically regional or world market prices. Consequently, our business and financial results are affected, directly and indirectly, by world economic conditions, including instability in credit markets, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates, volatile exchange rates and other challenges such as the changing regulatory environment.
  
 Failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations or court decisions could expose us to fines, penalties and other costs. Moreover, changes in laws or regulations, such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements (including import or export licensing requirements), or changes in reporting requirements of the U.S., European Union ("EU") or Asian governmental agencies, could increase the cost of doing business in these regions. Any of these conditions may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future prices for our securities, including our stock.
  
 In addition, we have significant operations and financial relationships based in Europe. Sales originating in Europe accounted for approximately 29% of our consolidated sales revenue in 2017. Adverse conditions in the European economy may negatively impact our overall financial results due to reduced economic growth and resulting decreased end-use customer demand.
  
 Finally, conditions such as the uncertainties associated with war, terrorist activities, civil unrest, epidemics, pandemics, weather, natural disasters, the effects of climate change or political instability in any of the countries in which we operate or have significant customers or suppliers could affect us by causing delays or losses in the supply or delivery of raw materials and products, as well as increasing security costs, insurance premiums and other expenses. These conditions could also result in or lengthen economic recession in the U.S., Europe, Asia or elsewhere.
  
 Our Malaysian debt is subject to subjective acceleration provisions and demand provisions that allow our lending institutions to accelerate payment at any time.  If TMM’s debt was accelerated under the demand provisions, our working capital and financial condition would be severely impacted.
  
 TMM has loan agreements with banks in Malaysia that provide short-term credit facilities and term loans.  These borrowings are subject to certain subjective acceleration provisions based on the judgment of the banks and demand provisions that provide that the banks may demand repayment at any time.  We believe such a demand provision is customary in Malaysia for such facilities.  At December 31, 2017, our Malaysian debt consisted of long-term debt of $309,000.
  
 If demand is made by the banks, we may require additional debt or equity financing to meet our working capital and operational requirements and to refinance our maturing or demanded indebtedness.  Should we find it necessary to raise additional funds, we may find that such funds are either not available or are available only on terms that are unattractive in terms of shareholders’ interest.  If this debt could not be repaid or refinanced, the banks could foreclose and sell our foreign operations, which would adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity.
  
 
  
- 10 - 
-------------

   

 Our business is affected by global economic factors including risks associated with declining economic conditions.
  
 Our financial results are substantially dependent upon overall economic conditions in the United States, the EU and Asia.  Declining economic conditions or negative perceptions about economic conditions in any or all of these locations could result in a substantial decrease in demand for our products and could adversely affect our business.
  
 Uncertain economic conditions and market instability make it difficult for us, our customers and our suppliers to forecast demand trends.  Declines in demand would place additional pressure on our results of operations. The timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions is uncertain and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time.  Consequently, at present, we are unable to accurately predict future economic conditions or the effect of such conditions on our financial conditions or results of operations, and we can give no assurances as to the timing, extent or duration of the current or future economic cycles impacting our industry.
  
 We have undertaken cost-savings initiatives to improve our operating performance, but we may not be able to implement and/or administer these initiatives in the manner contemplated and these initiatives may not produce the desired results.
 
 We have undertaken cost-savings initiatives and may undertake additional cost-savings initiatives in the future. These initiatives involve, among other things, staff reductions. Although we expect these initiatives to help us achieve incremental cost savings and operational efficiencies, we may not be able to implement and/or administer these initiatives, including staff reductions, in the manner contemplated, which could cause the initiatives to fail to achieve the desired results. Additionally, the implementation of these initiatives may result in impairment charges, some of which could be material. Even if we do implement and administer these initiatives in the manner contemplated, they may not produce the desired results. Accordingly, the initiatives that we have implemented and those that we may implement in the future may not improve our operating performance and may not help us achieve cost savings. Failure to successfully implement and/or administer these initiatives could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. 
 
 We strive to improve operating margins through sales growth, price increases, productivity gains, and improved purchasing techniques, but we may not achieve the desired improvements.
 
 We work to improve operating profit margins through activities such as growing sales to achieve increased economies of scale, increasing prices, improving manufacturing processes, and adopting purchasing techniques that lower costs or provide increased cost predictability to realize cost savings. However, these activities depend on a combination of improved product design and engineering, effective manufacturing process control initiatives, cost-effective redistribution of production, and other efforts that may not be as successful as anticipated. The success of sales growth and price increases depends not only on our actions but also on the strength of customer demand and competitors' pricing responses, which are not fully predictable. Failure to successfully implement actions to improve operating margins could adversely affect our financial performance. 
  
 Our businesses depend on a continuous stream of new products, and failure to introduce new products could affect our sales, profitability and liquidity.
 
 One way that we remain competitive is by developing and introducing new and improved products on an ongoing basis. Customers continually evaluate our products in comparison to those offered by our competitors. A failure to introduce new products at the right time that are price competitive and that provide the features and performance required by customers could adversely affect our sales, or could require us to compensate by lowering prices. In addition, when we invest in new product development, we face risks related to production delays, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical difficulties, which could impact sales, profitability and/or liquidity. 
  
 Our strategy includes seeking opportunities in new growth markets, and failure to identify or successfully enter such markets could affect our ability to grow our revenues and earnings.
 
 Certain of our products are sold into mature markets and part of our strategy is to identify and enter into markets growing more rapidly. These growth opportunities may involve new geographies, new product lines, new technologies or new customers. We may not be successful capitalizing on such opportunities and our ability to increase our revenue and earnings could be impacted. 
 
  
- 11 - 
-------------

   

 The markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to intense price competition, which could adversely affect our sales and earnings performance.
 
 Our customers typically have multiple suppliers from which to choose. If we are unwilling or unable to provide products at competitive prices, and if other factors, such as product performance and value-added services, do not provide an offsetting competitive advantage, customers may reduce, discontinue, or decide not to purchase our products. If we could not secure alternate customers for lost business, our sales and earnings performance could be adversely affected. 
  
 Our multi-jurisdictional tax structure may not provide favorable tax efficiencies.
 
 We conduct our business operations in the United States, Malaysia and The Netherlands and are subject to taxation in those jurisdictions. While we seek to minimize our worldwide effective tax rate, our corporate structure may not optimize tax efficiency opportunities. We develop our tax position based upon the anticipated nature and structure of our business and the tax laws, administrative practices and judicial decisions now in effect in the countries in which we have operations, which are subject to change or differing interpretations. In addition, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several other factors, including: increases in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes, the tax effects of restructuring charges or purchase accounting for acquisitions, changes related to our ability to ultimately realize future benefits attributed to our deferred tax assets, including those related to other-than-temporary impairment, as well as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 regarding the taxation of foreign earnings, which impacted our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings. Further, we are subject to review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities, which may result in adverse decisions. Increased tax expense could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.
  
 We are exposed to risks associated with acts of God, terrorists and others, as well as fires, explosions, wars, riots, accidents, embargoes, natural disasters, strikes and other work stoppages, quarantines and other governmental actions, and other events or circumstances that are beyond our control.
 
 We are exposed to risks from various events that are beyond our control, which may have significant effects on our results of operations. While we attempt to mitigate these risks through appropriate loss prevention measures, insurance, contingency planning and other means, we may not be able to anticipate all risks or to reasonably or cost-effectively manage those risks that we do anticipate. As a result, our operations could be adversely affected by circumstances or events in ways that are significant and/or long lasting. 
 
 The risks and uncertainties identified above are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely affect us. If any known or unknown risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have material adverse effects on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
  
 Costs of raw materials and energy have resulted, and may continue to result, in increased operating expenses and reduced results of operations.
  
 We purchase large amounts of raw materials and energy for our manufacturing operations.  The cost of these raw materials and energy, in the aggregate, represent a substantial portion of our operating expenses.  The costs of raw materials and energy generally follow price trends of, and vary with the market conditions, for crude oil and natural gas, which may be highly volatile and cyclical.  Moreover, the fluctuation of the U.S. Dollar to other currencies adds to the volatility in raw material costs.  There have been, and will likely continue to be, periods of time when we are unable to pass raw material and energy cost increases on to our customers quickly enough to avoid adverse impacts on our results of operations.  Our results of operations have been in the past, and could be in the future, significantly affected by increases and volatility in these costs.  Cost increases also may increase working capital needs, which could reduce our liquidity and cash flow.  In addition, when raw material and energy costs increase rapidly and are passed along to customers as product price increases, the credit risks associated with certain customers can be compounded.  To the extent we increase our product sales prices to reflect rising raw material and energy costs, demand for products may decrease as customers reduce their consumption and use substitute products, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
  
 
 
  
- 12 - 
-------------

   

 Climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could adversely impact our results of operations.
  
 In addition to the possible direct economic impact that climate change could have on us, climate change regulation could significantly increase our costs.  Energy costs are a significant component of our overall costs, and climate change regulation may result in significant increases in the cost of energy.
  
 We are dependent on a limited number of customers and could experience significant revenue reductions if they use alternative sources.
  
 We derive a significant portion of our revenue each quarter from a limited number of customers.  Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 37% of our consolidated sales revenues in 2017.  As a result, a decrease in sales volume of any one of our top 10 customers could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, one customer, BASF, represented approximately 14% and 24%, respectively, of our total consolidated sales and the loss of this customer could have a material impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.
  
 Foreign currency fluctuations could adversely impact our financial condition.
  
 We conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the United States. Consequently, fluctuations in currencies of other countries, especially the Euro, may materially affect our operating results. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. Dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period. Therefore, increases or decreases in value of the U.S. Dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the cost of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign exchange rates can also impact the competitiveness of products produced in certain jurisdictions and exported for sale into other jurisdictions. These changes may impact the value received for the sale of our goods versus those of our competitors.
  
 In addition to currency translation risks, we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiary's functional currency. Given the volatility of exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and translation risks effectively.  Failure to effectively manage these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  (See “Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Other Matters –  Foreign Operations – Impact of Exchange Rate”).
  
 We are required to make estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results.
  
 In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts under different conditions and assumptions.
  
 Our competitors are established companies that have greater experience than us in a number of crucial areas, including manufacturing and distribution.
  
 There is intense competition with respect to each of our products.  In order to maintain sales volume, we must consistently deliver high quality products on schedule at competitive prices.  Our competitors range from large corporations with full lines of production capabilities and products, such as Kronos, Inc., the Chemours Company and J. M. Huber, to small local firms specializing in one or two products and, more recently, we have faced competition from a large number of Chinese suppliers.  The established companies have significantly greater experience than us in manufacturing and distributing products and have considerably more resources and market share than we do.  We may have difficulty competing with these companies.

 Production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers' demands.
  
 A disruption in production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. Disruptions could occur for many reasons, including fire, natural disasters, weather, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems, disease, strikes or other labor unrest, transportation interruption, government regulation, political unrest or terrorism. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. If one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time, our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our customers' needs, which could cause them to seek other suppliers. 
  
 Our U.S. operation is located on the Gulf of Mexico coastline and could be adversely affected by hurricanes.
  
 We may be subject to work stoppages for hurricanes, particularly during the period ranging from June to November.  If a hurricane is severe and our Corpus Christi plant incurs heavy damage and prolonged downtime, which may not be fully covered by insurance, our financial results would be adversely affected.
  
 The insurance coverage that we maintain may not fully cover all operational risks.
  
 We maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We may incur losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of our insurance policies, including liabilities for environmental remediation. In the future, the types of insurance we obtain and the level of coverage we maintain may be inadequate or we may be unable to continue to maintain our existing insurance coverage or obtain comparable insurance coverage at a reasonable cost.
  
 Our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers, customers and business partners and the industries in which our suppliers, customers and business partners participate are cyclical in nature, both of which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.
  
 Some of the industries in which our end-use customers participate, such as the automotive, electrical, construction and textile industries, are highly competitive, to a large extent driven by end-use applications, and may experience overcapacity, all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products. Our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers, customers and business partners and reductions in demand for our customers' products. These risks include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products, delays in or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers, suppliers or other creditors. In addition, many of these industries are cyclical in nature, thus posing risks to us that vary throughout the year. The occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability and financial condition.
  
 Our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings.
  
 We are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits and claims in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. The outcome of existing proceedings, lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation are often difficult to reliably predict. As a result, future adverse rulings, settlements, or unfavorable developments could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition in any particular period.

 The Company is subject to cyber security risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks and to respond to cyber incidents.
  
 The Company’s business involves the storage and transmission of the Company’s and its customers’ and suppliers’ proprietary information, and security breaches could expose it to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability. A number of companies have disclosed security breaches, some of which have involved intentional attacks. The Company may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks. Attacks may be targeted at the Company, its customers, or both. If an actual or perceived breach of security occurs, customer and/or supplier perception of the effectiveness of the Company’s security measures could be harmed and could result in the loss of customers, suppliers or both. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause the Company to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third party experts and consultants.
  
 A person who is able to circumvent the Company’s security measures could misappropriate the Company’s or its customers’ and suppliers’ proprietary information, cause interruption in its operations, damage its computers or those of its users, or otherwise damage its reputation and business. Any compromise of security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to the Company’s reputation, and/or a loss of confidence in its security measures, which could harm its business.
  
 The Company’s servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions, including “denial-of-service” type attacks. The Company may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Security breaches, including any breach by the Company or by persons with whom it has commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of its users’ personal information, could damage its reputation and expose it to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability.
