Overview 
 
Northeast Bancorp, incorporated under Maine law in 1987, is a bank holding company, registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve") under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Company's primary subsidiary and principal asset is its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Northeast Bank (the "Bank" or "Northeast Bank"), a Maine state-chartered bank originally organized in 1872.
 
On December 29, 2010, the merger of the Company and FHB Formation LLC (the "Merger"), a Delaware limited liability company ("FHB"), was consummated. In connection with the transaction, as part of the regulatory approval process, the Company and the Bank made certain commitments to the Federal Reserve, the most significant of which are (i) to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 10%, (ii) to maintain a total capital ratio of at least 15%, (iii) to limit purchased loans to 40% of total loans, (iv) to fund 100% of the Company's loans with core deposits (defined as non-maturity deposits and non-brokered insured time deposits), and (v) to hold commercial real estate loans (including owner-occupied commercial real estate) to within 300% of total capital. On June 28, 2013, the Federal Reserve approved the amendment of the commitment to hold commercial real estate loans to within 300% of total capital to exclude owner-occupied commercial real estate loans. All other commitments made to the Federal Reserve in connection with the Merger remain unchanged. The Company and the Bank are currently in compliance with all commitments to the Federal Reserve.
 
As of June 30, 2018, the Company, on a consolidated basis, had total assets of $1.2 billion, total deposits of $954.9 million, and shareholders' equity of $138.4 million. We gather retail deposits through the Community Banking Division's ten full-service branches in Maine and through our online deposit program, ableBanking; originate loans through the Community Banking Division; purchase and originate commercial loans on a nationwide basis through the Bank’s Loan Acquisition and Servicing Group ("LASG"); and originate Small Business Administration and United States Department of Agriculture (“SBA”) loans on a nationwide basis through the Bank’s national SBA group ("SBA Division").
 
Unless the context otherwise requires, references herein to the Company include the Company and the Bank on a consolidated basis.
 
Strategy 
 
The Company's goal is to prudently grow its franchise, while maintaining sound operations and risk management, by means of the following strategies:
 
Continuing to grow the LASG’s national originated and purchased loan business. We purchase commercial real estate loans nationally, at prices that on average have produced yields significantly higher than those available on our originated loan portfolio. We also originate loans nationally, taking advantage of our core expertise in underwriting and servicing national credits.
 
Growing our national SBA origination business. We originate loans on a national basis to small businesses, primarily through the SBA 7(a) program, which provides the partial guarantee of the SBA.
 
Continuing our community banking tradition. With a history that dates to 1872, our Community Banking Division maintains its focus on sales and service, with the goal of attracting and retaining deposits, and serving the lending needs of retail and commercial customers within our core markets.
 
Generating deposits to fund our business. We offer a full line of deposit products through our ten-branch network located in the Community Banking Division’s market. ableBanking is a direct savings platform providing an additional channel to raise core deposits to fund our asset strategy.
 
Market Area and Competition 
 
The LASG and SBA Division activities are nationwide. The LASG competes primarily with community banks, regional banks and private equity funds operating nationwide in its bid to acquire primarily commercial real estate loans. We believe that we often have a competitive advantage in bidding against private equity funds on performing loans because those funds generally have higher funding costs and, therefore, higher expectations for return on investment than we do. Furthermore, private equity funds typically do not compete for small balance commercial loans and typically pursue larger, bulk transactions. Due to improving credit quality over the past several years and the low interest rate environment, the supply of loans available for purchase has declined, competition has increased, and spreads have tightened. Despite these trends, we believe that the LASG continues to have a competitive advantage in bidding against other banks because we have a specialized group with experience in purchasing commercial real estate loans. Additionally, most banks we compete against are community banks looking to acquire loans in their market; these banks usually have specific criteria for their acquisition activities and do not pursue pools with collateral or geographic diversity.

The SBA Division competes primarily with community banks, regional banks, national/global banks, and non-bank licensed lenders on a nationwide basis. Capitalizing on our LASG origination loan infrastructure, the SBA Division is in a position to review and act quickly on a variety of lending opportunities. Risk management, approvals, underwriting and other due diligence for these loans is similar to that for the LASG loans. We believe that the SBA Division has an advantage in originating commercial real estate loans because of its ability to utilize in-house staff to quickly and accurately screen loan opportunities, which accelerates the underwriting process.
 
The Community Banking Division’s market area includes the six New England states, with the majority of its activities centered in the western and central regions of the State of Maine. We encounter significant competition in the Community Banking Division market area in originating loans, attracting deposits, and selling other customer products and services. Our competitors include savings banks, commercial banks, credit unions, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking companies, finance companies, and other financial intermediaries. Many of our primary competitors there have substantially greater resources, larger established customer bases, higher lending limits, extensive branch networks, numerous ATMs and greater advertising and marketing budgets. They may also offer services that we do not currently provide. ableBanking has a nationwide scope in its deposit gathering activities and competes with banks and credit unions, as well as other, larger, online direct banks having a national reach.
 
Lending Activities 
 
General
 
We conduct our loan-related activities through three primary channels: the LASG, the SBA Division, and the Community Banking Division. The LASG purchases primarily performing commercial real estate loans, on a nationwide basis, typically at a discount from their unpaid principal balances, producing yields higher than those normally achieved on the Company's originated loan portfolio. The LASG also originates commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans on a nationwide basis. The SBA Division originates loans to small businesses, primarily through the SBA 7(a) program, which provides the partial guarantee of the SBA. The Community Banking Division originates loans directly to consumers and businesses located in its market area. At June 30, 2018, our total loan portfolio (excluding loans held for sale) was $871.8 million, of which $688.3 million, or 79.0%, was purchased or originated by the LASG, $60.2 million, or 6.9%, was originated by the SBA Division, and $123.3 million, or 14.1%, was originated by the Community Banking Division.

We individually underwrite all loans that we originate and purchase. Our loan underwriting policies are reviewed and approved annually by our Board of Directors (the “Board”). Each loan, regardless of whether it is originated or purchased, must meet underwriting criteria set forth in our lending policies and the requirements of applicable federal and state regulations. All loans are subject to approval procedures and amount limitations, and the Board approves loan relationships exceeding certain prescribed dollar limits. We supplement our own supervision of the loan underwriting and approval process with periodic loan audits by internal personnel and outside professionals experienced in loan review. As of June 30, 2018, the Bank’s legal lending limit was $32.4 million.
 
We typically retain servicing rights for all loans that we originate or purchase, except for residential loans that we originate and sell servicing released in the secondary market.

Loan Purchase Strategies. The LASG's loan purchasing strategy involves the acquisition of commercial loans, typically secured by real estate or other business assets located throughout the United States.
 
 6


We acquire commercial loans typically at a discount to their unpaid principal balances. While we acquire loans on a nationwide basis, we seek to avoid significant concentration in any geographic region or in any one collateral type. We do not seek acquisition opportunities for which the primary collateral is land, construction, or one- to four-family residential property, although in a very limited number of cases, loans secured by such collateral may be included in a pool of otherwise desirable loans. Purchased loans are sourced on a nationwide basis from banks, insurance companies, investment funds and government agencies, either directly or indirectly through advisors.
 
We focus on servicing released, whole loan or lead participation transactions so that we can control the management of the portfolio through our experienced asset management professionals. Purchased loans can be acquired as a single relationship or combined with other borrowers in a larger pool. Loans are bid to a minimal acceptable yield to maturity based on the overall risk of the loan, including expected repayment terms and the underlying collateral value. Updated loan-to-value ratios and loan terms both influence the amount of discount the Bank requires in determining whether a loan meets the Bank's guidelines. We often achieve actual results in excess of our minimal acceptable yield to maturity when a loan is prepaid.
 
At June 30, 2018, purchased loans had an unpaid principal balance of $326.9 million and a book value of $291.0 million, representing a total discount of 11.0%.
 
The following table shows the purchased loan portfolio as of June 30, 2018 by original purchase price percentage:
 

Initial Investment as a % of | | | | |

 | (Dollars in thousands) | | |

>90% | | 176,017 | | 60.49 | %
Total | $ | 290,972 | | 100.00 | %

Secondary Market for Commercial Loans. Commercial whole loans are typically sold either directly by sellers or through loan sale advisors. Because a central database for commercial whole loan transactions does not exist, we attempt to compile our own statistics by both polling major loan sale advisors to obtain their aggregate trading volume and tracking the deal flow that we see directly via a proprietary database. This data reflects only a portion of the total market, as commercial whole loans that are sold in private direct sales or through other loan sale advisors are not included in our surveys. In recent years, the ratio of performing loans to total loans in the market has increased, in part, because sellers have worked through their most troubled, non-performing loans or are looking to minimize the discount they would receive in a secondary market transaction. While the 2008-2010 economic crisis led to a high level of trading volume, we also expect the market to remain active in times of economic prosperity, as sellers tend to have additional reserve capacity to sell their unwanted assets. Furthermore, we believe that the continued consolidation of the banking industry will create secondary market activity as acquirers often sell non-strategic borrowing relationships or assets that create excess loan concentrations.
Underwriting of Purchased Loans. We review many loan purchase opportunities and commence underwriting on a relatively small percentage of loans. Purchased loans are underwritten by a team of in-house, seasoned analysts before being considered for approval. Prior to commencing underwriting, loans are analyzed for performance characteristics, loan terms, collateral quality, and price expectations. We also consider whether the loans would make our total purchased loan portfolio more or less diverse with respect to geography, loan type and collateral type. The opportunity is underwritten once it has been identified as fitting our investment parameters. While the extent of underwriting may vary based on investment size, procedures generally include the following:

• | A loan analyst reviews and analyzes the seller credit file and our own internal and third party research in order to assess credit risk;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | With the assistance of local counsel, where appropriate, an in-house attorney makes a determination regarding the quality of loan documentation and enforceability of loan terms;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | An in-house real estate specialist performs real estate collateral evaluations, which includes conducting original market research for trends and sale and lease comparables, and develops a valuation based on current data reflecting what we believe are recent trends;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | An environmental assessment is performed on real estate collateral where appropriate;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | A property inspection is generally performed on all real estate collateral securing a loan, focusing on several characteristics, including, among other things, the physical quality of the property, current occupancy, general quality and occupancy within the neighborhood, market position and nearby property listings; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | An underwriting package containing the analysis and results is reviewed and submitted for approval by the LASG Credit Committee.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Collateral Valuation. The estimated value of the real property collateralizing the loan is determined by the LASG's in-house real estate group, which considers, among other factors, the type of property, its condition, location and its highest and best use in its marketplace. An inspection is conducted for the real property securing all loans bid upon. For loans that exceed a certain dollar threshold as prescribed in our credit policy, members of the LASG typically conduct an in-person site inspection.
 
We generally view cash flow from operations as the primary source of repayment on purchased loans. The LASG analyzes the current and likely future cash flows generated by the collateral to repay the loan. Also considered are minimum debt service coverage ratios, consisting of the ratio of net operating income to total scheduled principal and interest payments. Consideration of the debt service coverage ratio is critical to the pricing and rating of purchased and originated loans, and is analyzed carefully. For purchased loans, care is taken to ensure that, unless significantly offset by other factors in the credit, the purchase price results in an adjusted debt service coverage ratio that is within the Bank’s lending limits. Moreover, if the debt service coverage ratio based on the contractual payments, regardless of the Bank’s exposure, is significantly below 1.0x, then steps are taken to document alternative sources of repayment or develop a realistic plan to ensure continued performance of the loan.
 
Loan Pricing. In determining the amount that we are willing to bid to acquire individual loans or loan pools, the LASG considers the following:
 

• | Collateral securing the loan;
--+------------------------------


• | Geographic location;
--+---------------------


• | Financial resources of the borrower or guarantors, if any;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Recourse nature of the loan;
--+-----------------------------


• | Age and performance of the loan;
--+---------------------------------


• | Length of time during which the loan has performed in accordance with its repayment term;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Yield expected to be earned; and
--+---------------------------------


• | Servicing restrictions, if any.
--+--------------------------------

 
In addition to the factors listed above and despite the fact that purchased loans are typically performing loans, the LASG also estimates the amount that we may realize through collection efforts or foreclosure and sale of the collateral, net of expenses, and the length of time and costs required to complete the collection or foreclosure process in the event a loan becomes non-performing or is non-performing at the time of purchase.
 
Loan Originations. In addition to purchasing loans, the LASG also originates commercial loans on a nationwide basis. Capitalizing on our purchased loan infrastructure, the LASG is in a position to review and act quickly on a variety of lending opportunities. Risk management, approvals, underwriting and other due diligence for these loans is similar to that for purchased loans, other than the appraisal and documentation process, which mirrors the Community Banking Division’s practice of employing local attorneys and real estate appraisers to assist in the process. We believe that the LASG has an advantage in originating commercial loans because of its ability to utilize in-house staff to quickly and accurately screen loan opportunities and accelerate the underwriting process.
Loan Servicing. We conduct all loan servicing for purchased and originated loans with an in-house team of experienced asset managers who actively manage the loan portfolio. Asset managers initiate and maintain regular borrower contact, and ensure that the loan credit analysis is accurate. Collateral valuations, property inspections, and other collateral characteristics are updated periodically as a result of our ongoing in-house real estate analysis. All asset management activity and analysis is contained within a central database.

SBA Division
 
General. The SBA Division, launched in November 2014, originates loans to small businesses nationwide, most often through the SBA's 7(a) program, which provides a partial government guarantee. Our loans are typically secured by liens on business assets and mortgages on commercial properties, and also benefit from SBA guarantees. We seek to build a loan portfolio that is diverse with respect to geography, loan type and collateral type.
 
The following table summarizes the SBA Division loan portfolio as of June 30, 2018:
 

 | SBA Division | 
------------------------------------------+------------------------+-------
 | (Dollars in thousands) | 
Non-owner occupied commercial real estate | $ | 29,488
Owner occupied commercial real estate | | 24,483
Commercial and industrial | | 6,057 
1-4 family residential | | 128 
Total | $ | 60,156

 
The Company's SBA loan portfolio includes owner and non-owner occupied loans as defined under regulatory call report instructions. The regulatory call report instructions primarily consider the primary source of repayment on the loan for this determination. However, these loans meet the SBA requirements to be considered owner occupied as the owner or controlling entity are actively involved in the daily operations of the underlying core business.
 
In addition to the loans held in the SBA Division loan portfolio, as of June 30, 2018, $3.8 million in the loans held for sale portfolio were attributable to the SBA Division, consisting of the guaranteed portion of the SBA Division loans that we expect to sell in the secondary market.
 
Secondary Market for SBA Guarantees. We typically sell the SBA-guaranteed portion of our variable-rate originations (generally 75% of the principal balance) at a premium in the secondary market. We generally retain a 25% unguaranteed interest and the accompanying servicing rights to the entire loan. We hold most fixed-rate SBA loan originations in portfolio.
 
Underwriting of SBA Division Loans. Our loan policies and procedures establish guidelines governing our SBA lending program. Generally, these guidelines address the types of loans that we seek, target markets, underwriting and collateral requirements, terms, interest rate and yield considerations and compliance with laws and regulations. All loans or credit lines are subject to approval procedures and amount limitations. Our policies are reviewed and approved at least annually by our Board to ensure that we are following SBA underwriting guidelines.
 
Loan Servicing. We conduct all loan servicing for SBA Division loans with an in-house team of experienced asset managers who actively manage the loan portfolio. Asset managers initiate and maintain regular borrower contact, and ensure that the loan credit analysis is accurate. Collateral valuations, property inspections, and other collateral characteristics are updated periodically as a result of our ongoing in-house real estate analysis. All asset management activity and analysis is contained within a central database.
Community Banking Division Originations
 
Loan Portfolio. The Community Banking Division’s loan portfolio consists primarily of loans to businesses and consumers in the Community Banking Division's market area.
 

• | Residential Mortgage Loans. We originate residential mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family properties primarily throughout Maine. Such loans may be originated for sale in the secondary market or to be held on the Bank's balance sheet. We also offer home equity loans and home equity lines of credit, which are secured by first or second mortgages on one- to four-family owner-occupied properties and are held on our balance sheet. At June 30, 2018, portfolio residential loans totaled $79.1 million, or 9.1% of total loans. Of the residential loans we held for investment at June 30, 2018, approximately 54.5% were adjustable rate. Included in residential loans are home equity lines of credit and other second mortgage loans aggregating approximately $10.5 million.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Commercial Real Estate Loans. We originate multi-family and other commercial real estate loans secured by property located primarily in the Community Banking Division's market area. At June 30, 2018, commercial real estate loans outstanding were $30.1 million, or 3.4% of total loans. Although the largest commercial real estate loan originated by the Community Banking Division had a principal balance of $1.7 million at June 30, 2018, the majority of the commercial real estate loans originated by the Community Banking Division had principal balances less than $500 thousand.

• | Commercial and industrial Loans. We originate commercial and industrial loans, including term loans, lines of credit and equipment and receivables financing to businesses located primarily in the Community Banking Division's market area. At June 30, 2018, commercial and industrial loans outstanding were $10.9 million, or 1.3% of total loans. At June 30, 2018, there were 98 commercial and industrial loans outstanding with an average principal balance of $112 thousand. The largest of these commercial and industrial loans had a principal balance of $1.9 million at June 30, 2018.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consumer Loans. We originate, on a direct basis, automobile, boat and recreational vehicle loans. At June 30, 2018, consumer loans outstanding were $3.2 million, or 0.4% of total loans.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Underwriting of Loans. Most residential loans, including those held for investment, are originated in accordance with the standards of the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal Housing Authority, or other third party correspondent lenders. Our underwriting process for all other loans originated by the Community Banking Division is as follows:

• | Most of our Community Banking Division originated loans are sourced through relationships between loan officers and third-party referral sources or current or previous customers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | After a loan officer has taken basic information from the borrower, the request is submitted to the Community Banking Division's loan production department. The loan production department obtains comprehensive information from the borrower and third parties, and conducts verification and analysis of the borrower information, which is assembled into a single underwriting package that is submitted for final approval.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Investment Activities 
 
Our securities portfolio and short-term investments provide and maintain liquidity, assist in managing the interest rate sensitivity of our balance sheet, and serve as collateral for certain of our obligations. Individual investment decisions are made based on the credit quality of the investment, liquidity requirements, potential returns, cash flow targets, and consistency with our asset/liability management objectives.
Sources of Funds 
 
Deposits have traditionally been the primary source of the Bank's funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition to deposits, the Bank obtains funds from the amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, the sale, call or maturity of securities, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (the "FHLBB"), other term borrowings and cash flows generated by operations.
Deposits 
 
We offer a full line of deposit products to customers in western and south-central Maine through our ten-branch network. Our deposit products consist of demand deposit, NOW, money market, savings and certificate of deposit accounts. Our customers access their funds through ATMs, MasterCard® Debit Cards, Automated Clearing House funds (electronic transfers) and checks. We also offer telephone banking, online banking and bill payment, mobile banking and remote deposit capture services. Interest rates on our deposits are based upon factors that include prevailing loan demand, deposit maturities, alternative costs of funds, interest rates offered by competing financial institutions and other financial service firms, and general economic conditions. At June 30, 2018, we had core deposits of $954.9 million, representing 100% of total deposits. We define core deposits as non-maturity deposits and non-brokered insured time deposits.
 
Our online deposit program, ableBanking, provides an additional channel through which to obtain core deposits to support our growth. ableBanking, which was launched in late fiscal 2012 as a division of Northeast Bank, had $323.5 million in money market and time deposits as of June 30, 2018. We also use deposit listing services to gather deposits from time to time, in support of our liquidity and asset/liability management objectives. At June 30, 2018, listing service deposits totaled $181.5 million, bearing a weighted-average remaining term of 0.98 years.
 
Borrowings 
 
While we currently consider core deposits (defined as non-maturity deposits and non-brokered insured time deposits) as our primary source of funding to support asset growth, advances from the FHLBB and other sources of wholesale funding remain an important part of our liquidity contingency planning. Northeast Bank may borrow up to 50% of its total assets from the FHLBB, and borrowings are typically collateralized by mortgage loans and securities pledged to the FHLBB. At June 30, 2018, we had $48.7 million of available borrowing capacity based on collateral. Northeast Bank can also borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, with any such borrowing collateralized by consumer loans pledged to the Federal Reserve.
 
 10


For the foreseeable future, we expect to rely less on borrowings than other banks of similar size, because of our regulatory commitment to fund 100% of our loans with core deposits, although the availability of FHLBB and Federal Reserve Bank of Boston advances and other sources of wholesale funding remain an important part of our liquidity contingency planning.
 
Employees 
 
As of June 30, 2018, the Company employed 167 full-time and 18 part-time employees. The Company's employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are good.
Other Subsidiaries 
 
As of June 30, 2018, the Bank had three wholly-owned non-bank subsidiaries:
 

• | 200 Elm Realty, LLC, which was established to hold commercial real estate acquired as a result of loan workouts.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 500 Pine Realty, LLC, which was established to hold residential real estate acquired as a result of loan workouts.

Supervision and Regulation 
 
General 
 
The following discussion addresses elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. This regulatory framework is intended primarily to protect the safety and soundness of depository institutions, the federal deposit insurance fund, and depositors, rather than the shareholders of a bank holding company such as the Company. This summary is not a comprehensive analysis of all applicable laws, and is qualified by reference to the applicable statutes and regulations.
 
Regulation of the Company
 
As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, which has the authority, among other things, to order bank holding companies to cease and desist from unsafe or unsound banking practices; to assess civil money penalties; and to order termination of non-banking activities or termination of ownership and control of a non-banking subsidiary by a bank holding company.
 
Source of Strength. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”), as amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the Company is required to serve as a source of financial strength for the Bank in the event of the financial distress of the Bank. This provision codifies the longstanding policy of the Federal Reserve. In addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its bank subsidiaries are subordinate to the payment of deposits and to certain other indebtedness. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a bank subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.
Acquisitions and Activities. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHCA”) prohibits a bank holding company, without prior approval of the Federal Reserve, from acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank; acquiring control of a bank; merging or consolidating with another bank holding company; or acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, the acquiring bank holding company would control more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of such other bank or bank holding company.
 
The BHCA also prohibits a bank holding company from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its subsidiary banks. However, a bank holding company may engage in and may own shares of companies engaged in certain activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking or managing and controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. 

 11


Limitations on Acquisitions of Company Common Stock. The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring “control” of a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting securities of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, would constitute the acquisition of control of a bank holding company.
 
In addition, the BHCA prohibits any company from acquiring control of a bank or bank holding company without first having obtained the approval of the Federal Reserve. Among other circumstances, under the BHCA, a company has control of a bank or bank holding company if the company owns, controls or holds with power to vote 25% or more of a class of voting securities of the bank or bank holding company; controls in any manner the election of a majority of directors or trustees of the bank or bank holding company; or the Federal Reserve has determined, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the company has the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank or bank holding company.
 
Regulation of the Bank 
 
As a Maine-chartered bank, the Bank is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Maine Bureau of Financial Institutions (the “Bureau”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”). The Federal Reserve may directly examine the subsidiaries of the Company, including the Bank. The enforcement powers available to federal and state banking regulators include, among other things, the ability to issue cease and desist or removal orders, to terminate insurance of deposits, to assess civil money penalties, to issue directives to increase capital, to place the bank into receivership, and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties.
 
Deposit Insurance. The deposit obligations of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the FDIC deposit insurance limit to $250,000 per depositor for deposits maintained in the same right and capacity at a particular insured depository institution. On March 15, 2016, the FDIC’s Board of Directors approved a final rule to increase the DIF’s reserve ratio to the statutorily required minimum ratio of 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. Small banks, which are generally those banks with under $10 billion in assets, will receive credits to offset the portion of their assessments that help to raise the reserve ratio from 1.15 percent to 1.35%. After the reserve ratio reaches 1.38%, the FDIC will automatically apply a small bank’s credits to reduce its regular assessment up to the entire amount of the assessment.
 
Deposit insurance assessments are based on assets. To determine its deposit insurance assessment, the Bank computes the base amount of its average consolidated assets less its average tangible equity (defined as the amount of Tier 1 capital) and the applicable assessment rate. On April 26, 2016, the FDIC’s Board of Directors adopted a final rule that changed the manner in which deposit insurance assessment rates are calculated for established small banks, generally those banks with less than $10 billion of assets that have been insured for at least five years. Under the final rule, beginning the first assessment period after June 30, 2016, assessments for established small banks with a CAMELS rating of 1 or 2 will range from 1.5 to 16 basis points, after adjustments, while assessment rates for established small institutions with a CAMELS composite rating of 4 or 5 may range from 11 to 30 basis points, after adjustments. Assessments for established banks with a CAMELS rating of 3 will range from 3 to 30 basis points.
 
The FDIC has the power to adjust deposit insurance assessment rates at any time. In addition, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”), the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices; is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations; or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. For the year ended June 30, 2018, the FDIC insurance expense for the Bank was $317 thousand.
 
Acquisitions and Branching. Prior approval from the Bureau and the FDIC is required in order for the Bank to acquire another bank or establish a new branch office. Well-capitalized and well-managed banks may acquire other banks in any state, subject to certain deposit concentration limits and other conditions, pursuant to the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes a state-chartered bank, such as the Bank, to establish new branches on an interstate basis to the same extent a bank chartered by the host state may establish branches.
 
Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Banks. Section 24 of the FDIA generally limits the types of equity investment an FDIC-insured state-chartered bank, such as the Bank, may make and the kinds of activities in which such a bank may engage, as a principal, to those that are permissible for national banks. Further, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“GLBA”) permits national banks and state banks, to the extent permitted under state law, to engage—via financial subsidiaries—in certain activities that are permissible for subsidiaries of a financial holding company. In order to form a financial subsidiary, a state-chartered bank must be well capitalized, and such banks would be subject to certain capital deduction, risk management and affiliate transaction rules, among other things.
 
 12


Lending Restrictions. Federal law limits a bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% or more shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. The terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the bank’s capital. The Dodd-Frank Act explicitly provides that an extension of credit to an insider includes credit exposure arising from a derivatives transaction, repurchase agreement, reverse repurchase agreement, securities lending transaction or securities borrowing transaction. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act requires that asset sale transactions with insiders must be on market terms, and if the transaction represents more than 10% of the capital and surplus of the bank, approved by a majority of the disinterested directors of the bank.
Brokered Deposits. Section 29 of the FDIA and FDIC regulations generally limit the ability of an insured depository institution to accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless the institution’s capital category is “well capitalized” or, with the FDIC’s approval, “adequately capitalized.” Depository institutions that have brokered deposits in excess of 10% of total assets will be subject to increased FDIC deposit insurance assessments. However, for institutions that are well capitalized and have a CAMELS composite rating of 1 or 2, reciprocal deposits are deducted from brokered deposits. In addition, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act provides that reciprocal deposits are not treated as brokered deposits in the case of a "well capitalized" institution that received a “outstanding” or “good” rating on its most recent examination to the extent the amount of such deposits does not exceed the lesser of $5 billion or 20% of the bank’s total liabilities.
Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires the FDIC to evaluate the Bank’s performance in helping to meet the credit needs of the entire communities it serves, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with its safe and sound banking operations, and to take this record into consideration when evaluating certain applications. The FDIC’s CRA regulations are generally based upon objective criteria of the performance of institutions under three key assessment tests: (i) a lending test, to evaluate the institution’s record of making loans in its service areas; (ii) an investment test, to evaluate the institution’s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses; and (iii) a service test, to evaluate the institution’s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs, and other offices. The Bank’s most recent performance evaluation from the FDIC was a “satisfactory” rating.
Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness 
 
Regulatory Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued substantially similar risk-based and leverage capital rules applicable to U.S. banking organizations such as the Company and the Bank. These rules are intended to reflect the relationship between the banking organization’s capital and the degree of risk associated with its operations based on transactions recorded on-balance sheet, as well as off-balance sheet. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels discussed below, due to the banking organization’s financial condition or actual or anticipated growth.
 
The capital adequacy rules define qualifying capital instruments and specify minimum amounts of capital as a percentage of assets that banking organizations are required to maintain. Common equity Tier 1 capital for banks and bank holding companies consists of common shareholders’ equity and related surplus. Tier 1 capital for banks and bank holding companies generally consists of the sum of common shareholders’ equity, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and related surplus and, in certain cases and subject to limitations, minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill, other non-qualifying intangible assets and certain other deductions. Tier 2 capital generally consists of hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt securities, cumulative perpetual preferred stock, term subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock, and, subject to limitations, allowances for loan losses. The sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, less certain required deductions, represents qualifying total capital. Prior to the effectiveness of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies were permitted to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock in Tier 1 capital, subject to limitations. However, the Federal Reserve’s capital rule applicable to bank holding companies permanently grandfathers nonqualifying capital instruments, including trust preferred securities, issued before May 19, 2010 by depository institution holding companies with less than $15 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2009, subject to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital. In addition, under rules that became effective January 1, 2016, accumulated other comprehensive income (positive or negative) must be reflected in Tier 1 capital; however, the Company was permitted to make a one-time, permanent election to continue to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from capital. The Company has made this election.
 
 13


Under the Federal Reserve’s capital rules applicable to the Company and the FDIC’s capital rules applicable to the Bank, the Company and the Bank are each required to maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5%, a minimum total Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6.0%, a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.0% and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. Additionally, subject to a transition schedule, these rules require an institution to establish a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital above the minimum risk-based capital requirements for “adequately capitalized” institutions that is greater than 2.5% of total risk weighted assets, or face restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, pay discretionary bonuses, and to engage in share repurchases. The capital conservation buffer will be fully phased in on January 1, 2019.
 
Under the FDIC’s rules, an FDIC supervised institution, such as the Bank, is considered “well capitalized” if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater; (iii) a common Tier 1 equity ratio of at least 6.5% or greater, (iv) a leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or greater; and (iv) is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.
 
Generally, a bank, upon being notified that it is not adequately capitalized (i.e., that it is “undercapitalized”), becomes subject to the prompt corrective action provisions of Section 38 of the FDIA that, for example, (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees, (ii) require that its federal bank regulatory agency, which is the FDIC in the case of the Bank, monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital, (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan, (iv) restrict the growth of the institution’s assets and (v) require prior regulatory approval of certain expansion proposals. A bank that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must concurrently submit a performance guarantee by each company that controls the bank. A bank that is “critically undercapitalized” (i.e., has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%) will be subject to further restrictions, and generally will be placed in conservatorship or receivership within 90 days.
 
The Bank is currently considered “well capitalized” under all regulatory definitions. Current capital rules do not establish standards for determining whether a bank holding company is well capitalized. However, for purposes of processing regulatory applications and notices, the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation Y provides that a bank holding company is considered “well capitalized” if (i) on a consolidated basis, the bank holding company maintains a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater; (ii) on a consolidated basis, the bank holding company maintains a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater; and (iii) the bank holding company is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve Board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.
 
Safety and Soundness Standard. The FDIA requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe standards, by regulations or guidelines, relating to internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, stock valuation and compensation, fees and benefits, and such other operational and managerial standards as the agencies deem appropriate. Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, these guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder. In addition, the federal banking agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the “prompt corrective action” provisions of FDIA. See “—Regulatory Capital Requirements” above. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.
 
Dividend Restrictions 
 
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The revenue of the Company (on a parent company only basis) is derived primarily from interest and dividends from the Bank. The right of the Company, and consequently the right of shareholders of the Company, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of the Bank through the payment of such dividends or otherwise is necessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of the Bank (including depositors), except to the extent that certain claims of the Company in a creditor capacity may be recognized.
Restrictions on Bank Holding Company Dividends. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends if the organization’s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, the prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition, or the bank holding company will not meet or is in danger of not meeting its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. The Federal Reserve has the authority to prohibit a bank holding company, such as the Company, from paying dividends if it deems such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice.
 
 14


Restrictions on Bank Dividends. The FDIC has the authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit a bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Federal law also prohibits the payment of dividends by a bank that will result in the bank failing to meet its applicable capital requirements on a pro forma basis. Maine law requires the approval of the Bureau for any dividend that would reduce a bank’s capital below prescribed limits.
Certain Transactions by Bank Holding Companies with their Affiliates 
 
There are various statutory restrictions on the extent to which bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries may borrow, obtain credit from or otherwise engage in “covered transactions” with their insured depository institution subsidiaries. In general, an “affiliate” of an insured depository institution includes the depository institution’s parent holding company and any subsidiary of the parent holding company. However, an “affiliate” does not generally include an operating subsidiary of an insured depository institution. The Dodd-Frank Act amended the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund for which the depository institution or one of its affiliates is an investment adviser. An insured depository institution (and its subsidiaries) may not lend money to, or engage in other covered transactions with, its non-depository institution affiliates if the aggregate amount of covered transactions outstanding involving the bank, plus the proposed transaction, exceeds the following limits: (a) in the case of any one such affiliate, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institution and its subsidiaries cannot exceed 10% of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution; and (b) in the case of all affiliates, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institution and its subsidiaries cannot exceed 20% of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution. For this purpose, “covered transactions” are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate, a purchase of or investment in securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets from an affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any person or company, the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate, securities borrowing or lending transactions with an affiliate that creates a credit exposure to such affiliate, or a derivatives transaction with an affiliate that creates a credit exposure to such affiliate. Certain covered transactions are also subject to collateral security requirements. Covered transactions as well as other types of transactions between a bank and a bank holding company must be on market terms, which means that the transaction must be conducted on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving nonaffiliates or, in the absence of comparable transactions, that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliates. Moreover, Section 106 of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 provides that, to further competition, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property of any kind, or furnishing of any service.
Consumer Protection Regulation 
 
The Company and the Bank are subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect consumers and prohibit unfair or deceptive business practices. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, Home Ownership Protection Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (“FACT Act”), GLBA, the Truth in Lending Act, CRA, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the National Flood Insurance Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Truth-in-Savings Act, the Secure and Fair Enforcement Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, and various state law counterparts. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must interact with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans and providing other services. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), which has the responsibility for making rules and regulations under the federal consumer protection laws relating to financial products and services. The CFPB also has a broad mandate to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts and practices and is specifically empowered to require certain disclosures to consumers and draft model disclosure forms. Failure to comply with consumer protection laws and regulations can subject financial institutions to enforcement actions, fines and other penalties. The FDIC examines the Bank for compliance with CFPB rules and enforces CFPB rules with respect to the Bank.
Mortgage Reform. The Dodd-Frank Act prescribes certain standards that mortgage lenders must consider before making a residential mortgage loan, including verifying a borrower’s ability to repay such mortgage loan. The Dodd-Frank Act also allows borrowers to assert violations of certain provisions of the Truth-in-Lending Act as a defense to foreclosure proceedings. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, prepayment penalties are prohibited for certain mortgage transactions and creditors are prohibited from financing insurance policies in connection with a residential mortgage loan or home equity line of credit. The Dodd-Frank Act requires mortgage lenders to make additional disclosures prior to the extension of credit, in each billing statement and for negative amortization loans and hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits mortgage originators from receiving compensation based on the terms of residential mortgage loans and generally limits the ability of a mortgage originator to be compensated by others if compensation is received from a consumer.
 
 15


Privacy and Customer Information Security. GLBA requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. In general, the Bank must provide its customers with an annual disclosure that explains its policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information and, except as otherwise required or permitted by law, the Bank is prohibited from disclosing such information, except as provided in such policies and procedures. However, as a result of amendments made by the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act, a financial institution is not required to send an annual privacy notice if the institution only discloses nonpublic personal information in accordance with certain exceptions from GLBA that do not require an opt-out to be provided and if the institution has not changed its policies and practices since the most recent privacy disclosure provided to consumers. GLBA also requires that the Bank develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information (as defined under GLBA), to protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information; and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. The Bank is also required to send a notice to customers whose “sensitive information” has been compromised if unauthorized use of this information has occurred or is “reasonably possible.” Most states, including Maine, have enacted legislation concerning breaches of data security and the duties of the Bank in response to a data breach. Congress continues to consider federal legislation that would require consumer notice of data security breaches. Pursuant to the FACT Act, the Bank must also develop and implement a written identity theft prevention program to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of certain accounts or certain existing accounts. Additionally, the FACT Act amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to generally prohibit a person from using information received from an affiliate to make a solicitation for marketing purposes to a consumer, unless the consumer is given notice and a reasonable opportunity and a reasonable and simple method to opt out of the making of such solicitations.
 
Anti-Money Laundering 
 
The Bank Secrecy Act. Under the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), a financial institution is required to have systems in place to detect certain transactions, based on the size and nature of the transaction. Financial institutions are generally required to report to the United States Treasury any cash transactions involving more than $10,000. In addition, financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports for transactions that involve more than $5,000 and which the financial institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect involves illegal funds, is designed to evade the requirements of the BSA or has no lawful purpose. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “USA PATRIOT Act”), which amended the BSA, is designed to deny terrorists and others the ability to obtain anonymous access to the U.S. financial system. The USA PATRIOT Act has significant implications for financial institutions and businesses of other types involved in the transfer of money. The USA PATRIOT Act, together with the implementing regulations of various federal regulatory agencies, has caused financial institutions, such as the Bank, to adopt and implement additional policies or amend existing policies and procedures with respect to, among other things, anti-money laundering compliance, suspicious activity, currency transaction reporting, customer identity verification and customer risk analysis. In evaluating an application under Section 3 of the BHCA to acquire a bank or an application under the Bank Merger Act to merge banks or affect a purchase of assets and assumption of deposits and other liabilities, the applicable federal banking regulator must consider the anti-money laundering compliance record of both the applicant and the target.
OFAC. The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These sanctions, which are administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons); and (iii) restrictions on transactions with or involving certain persons or entities. Blocked assets (for example, property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC.
