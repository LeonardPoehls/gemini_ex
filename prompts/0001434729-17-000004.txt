History
HSNi’s predecessor company began broadcasting television home shopping programming from its studios in St. Petersburg, Florida in 1981 and, by 1985, was broadcasting this programming through a national network of cable and local television stations 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The company's national distribution network consists of a combination of cable, satellite and broadcast systems and, as of December 31, 2016, the HSN television networks reached approximately 91.1 million residential homes in the United States.
The company began conducting business online in 1994 and formally launched HSN.com, the online shopping portal for the HSN television network, in 1999.
The company acquired Improvements, a catalog featuring thousands of innovative home, patio and outdoor products, in June 2001, and significantly grew its catalog business through the acquisition of Cornerstone Brands, Inc., with its portfolio of leading print catalogs and related websites, in April 2005.
HSNi was incorporated in Delaware in May 2008 in connection with the spin-off of several businesses previously owned by IAC/InterActiveCorp, or IAC. HSNi was formed to hold HSN and Cornerstone, the businesses that previously comprised most of IAC’s retailing segment. The spin-off from IAC (the "Spin-off") occurred on August 20, 2008 and, in connection with the Spin-off, HSNi's shares began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "HSNI."
In April 2012, it acquired Chasing Fireflies, a direct-to-consumer premium children's and family's lifestyle brand. 
HSNi regularly assesses its businesses in an effort to continuously strengthen its product and brand portfolio. HSNi divested of Smith+Noble, a brand specializing in window treatments, in May 2012 and The Territory Ahead, a brand specializing in casual apparel for men and women, in July 2012. HSNi then divested of Chasing Fireflies and TravelSmith, two of the apparel brands in the Cornerstone portfolio, in September 2016. 
What We Do
HSNi markets and sells a wide range of third party and proprietary private label merchandise directly to consumers through HSN, which includes the HSN television networks and digital platforms, including mobile, as well as through Cornerstone’s portfolio of catalogs and digital platforms, including mobile.

HSNi is committed to providing customers with an evolving variety of quality products and from brands that resonate with its customers. Products offered through HSN include jewelry, fashion (apparel & accessories), beauty & health (beauty, wellness and fitness), and home & other (including home, electronics, culinary and other). Featured products include proprietary label products and third party-branded products, some of which are produced exclusively for HSN, as well as merchandise generally available through other retailers. Cornerstone primarily offers home and outdoor furnishings, in addition to women and children's apparel, with the majority produced exclusively for its Cornerstone brands.
HSN
Overview
HSN includes the HSN television networks; its related website, HSN.com; its mobile applications, a limited number of outlet stores and its wholesale distribution of certain proprietary products to other retailers. The HSN television network broadcasts customer interactive home shopping programming 24 hours a day, seven days a week. HSN2, which debuted in August 2010, is a network that primarily distributes taped programming. HSN’s programming is intended to promote sales and customer loyalty through a combination of product quality, value and selection, coupled with product information, entertainment and interactive experiences. Programming is divided into separately televised segments, most of which have hosts who present and convey information regarding featured products, sometimes with the assistance of a celebrity, industry expert, representative from the product vendor or someone retained to aid in the sale of the products. HSN also produces entertainment such as live concerts to entertain and engage with customers and promote certain products. HSN.com is a business-to-consumer digital commerce site that sells all of the merchandise offered on the HSN television networks, together with complementary products and select merchandise sold exclusively on HSN.com. HSN provides seamless experiences across all digital platforms and optimizes each unique platform by delivering exclusive content both at HSN.com and on mobile phones and tablets, including the iPad, iPhone, Android and Windows devices. The HSN strategy is to create immersive experiences, offer differentiated products and leverage technology to build seamless relationships with its customers across all of its platforms. HSN fosters social communities as part of the HSN experience to encourage customers to share their product finds, thoughts and reviews with their friends via Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram.
Reach
HSN produces both live and recorded programming for the HSN television network primarily from its studios in St. Petersburg, Florida, and distributes this programming by means of satellite uplink facilities, which it owns and operates, to a satellite transponder which service is leased for a multi-year term. The satellite transponder agreement provides for continued carriage of the HSN television networks on a replacement transponder and/or replacement satellite, as applicable, in the event of a failure of the transponder and/or satellite. 
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, HSN's live broadcast reached approximately 91.4 million and 93.7 million homes of the approximately 114.7 million and 113.3 million homes, respectively, in the United States with a television set. Television households reached by the HSN television network as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 primarily include approximately 61.1 million and 63.5 million households capable of receiving cable and/or telephone company ("Telco") transmissions, respectively, and approximately 30.0 million and 30.1 million direct broadcast satellite system ("DBS") households, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, HSN2 reached approximately 47.5 million and 49.8 million homes, respectively. Television households reached by HSN2 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 primarily include approximately 37.3 million and 38.3 million households capable of receiving cable and/or Telco transmissions, respectively, and approximately 10.2 million and 11.5 million DBS households, respectively.
Pay Television Distribution
HSN has entered into distribution and affiliation agreements with cable television, Telco and DBS operators, collectively referred to in this document as pay television operators, in the United States to carry the HSN television networks, as well as to promote the networks by carrying related commercials and distributing related marketing materials to their respective subscriber bases. HSN currently has contracts with many local and national pay television operators to distribute HSN television programming. 
HSN’s larger pay television operators include Comcast, AT&T/DirecTV, Charter Communications and Echostar/DISH.
4

In exchange for this carriage and related promotional and other efforts, HSN generally pays these pay television operators a fee consisting of commissions based on a percentage of the net merchandise sales to their subscriber bases and/or a per subscriber fee. In some cases, pay television operators receive additional compensation in the form of commission guarantees in exchange for their commitments to deliver a specified number of subscribers, channel placement incentives and advertising insertion time on the HSN television network.
HSN typically negotiates agreements that require HSN to pay monthly or annual fees. Distribution and affiliation agreements with pay television operators expire from time to time and renewal and negotiation processes may be lengthy. At any given time in the ordinary course of business HSN is likely to be engaged in renewal and/or negotiation processes with multiple pay television operators. In some cases, renewals are not agreed upon prior to the expiration of a given agreement and the HSN television networks continue to be carried by the relevant pay television operator without an effective affiliation agreement in place or via month-to-month contracts. HSN expects that any extension of agreements that have expired will be on terms that, when taken as a whole, are commercially reasonable.
Broadcast Television Distribution
As of December 31, 2016, HSN also had affiliation agreements with 102 broadcast television stations for leased carriage of the HSN television networks with terms ranging from several weeks to several years. In exchange for this carriage, HSN pays the broadcast television stations hourly or monthly fixed rates or commissions based on a percentage of the net merchandise sales to their viewership bases. As of December 31, 2016, HSNi’s subsidiary, Ventana Television, Inc. also owned 25 broadcast television stations that carry the HSN television networks on a full-time basis.
HSN.com
HSN also includes HSN.com, a transactional e-commerce site that sells merchandise offered on the HSN television networks, as well as select merchandise sold exclusively on HSN.com. HSN.com provides customers with additional content to support and enhance HSN television programming. For example, HSN.com provides users with an online program guide, value-added video of product demonstrations, live streaming video of the HSN television network, customer-generated product reviews and additional information about HSN show hosts and guest personalities. HSN.com offers customers a content-rich experience that houses more than 50,000 product and how-to videos.
Mobile Distribution
HSN has applications for the iPhone, iPad, Android and Windows devices. These applications are highly video-centric, customized experiences that allow users to order merchandise, stream live video from HSN and watch previously-aired content from the network’s video library while simultaneously browsing related products. Among other things, these applications also allow customers to create their own personalized channels, select their favorite brands or categories of merchandise and compile videos focused on these preferences. Mobile devices represent our fastest growing sales channel.
Cornerstone
Cornerstone consists of a portfolio of aspirational home and apparel brands, prominent in the direct marketing and retail space, including catalog distribution and related websites. Although there is some overlap in the product offerings, the home brands are comprised of Frontgate, Ballard Designs, Grandin Road and Improvements. Garnet Hill focuses primarily on apparel and accessories and is categorized by HSNi as an apparel brand. There are also 16 retail and outlet stores located throughout the United States.
Frontgate features premium, high quality indoor (including bed, bath, kitchen, dining and living room) and outdoor (including patio, garden and pool) furnishings and accessories. Ballard Designs features European‑inspired bed, bath, dining, outdoor and office furnishings and accessories, as well as rugs, shelving and architectural accents for the home. Grandin Road offers an affordable style assortment of products ranging from occasional furniture, accessories, holiday décor and outdoor furniture and Improvements features thousands of innovative home, patio and outdoor products. Garnet Hill offers apparel and accessories for women and children as well as bed and bath furnishings and soft goods. 
The Cornerstone brands generally incorporate on-site photography and real-life settings, coupled with related editorial content describing the merchandise and depicting situations in which it may be used. Branded catalogs are designed and produced in-house, which enables each individual brand to control the production process and reduces the amount of lead time required to produce a given catalog.
5

New editions of full-color catalogs are mailed to customers several times each year, with a total annual circulation in 2016 of approximately 313 million catalogs. The timing and frequency of catalog circulation varies by brand and depends upon a number of factors, including the timing of the introduction of new products, marketing campaigns and promotions and inventory levels, among other factors.
Cornerstone also operates websites for each of its featured brands, such as Frontgate.com, BallardDesigns.com, GarnetHill.com, GrandinRoad.com and Improvementscatalog.com. These websites serve as additional storefronts for products featured in related print catalogs, as well as provide customers with additional content and product assortments to support and enhance their shopping experience. Additional content provided by these websites, which differs across the various websites, includes decorating tips, measuring information, online design centers, gift registries and travel centers, as well as a feature that allows customers to browse the related catalog online. In addition, a growing number of customers use mobile devices to shop the Cornerstone brands.
Supply
HSN and Cornerstone purchase products from numerous foreign and domestic manufactures and importers by way of short- and long-term contracts and purchase orders, including products made to their respective specifications, as well as name brand merchandise and lines from third party partners, typically with certain exclusive rights. The terms of these contracts and purchase orders vary depending upon the underlying products, the retail channel in which the products will ultimately be sold and the method of sale. In some cases, these contracts provide for the payment of additional amounts to partners in the form of commissions, the amount of which is based upon the achievement of agreed upon sales targets, among other milestones. In addition, in the case of some purchases, HSNi may have certain return, extended payment and/or termination rights. The mix and source of products generally depends upon a variety of factors, including price and availability, and HSNi manages inventory levels through periodic, ongoing analyses of anticipated and current sales. No single vendor accounted for more than 10% of HSNi’s consolidated net sales in 2016, 2015 or 2014.
Marketing and Merchandising
HSNi offers our customers a broad assortment of differentiated products in a compelling, informative and entertaining format that will inspire them to regularly engage and shop with us. For example, HSN frequently collaborates with experts from a variety of fields to present special events on the HSN television network featuring HSN products and relevant expert content. HSN produces live entertainment as a way to further engage with our customers. These events are staged at HSN’s television studios or elsewhere. Certain special events are also featured on HSN.com and HSN2 for a limited period of time following their live broadcast on the HSN television network. HSN also has integrated a gamification strategy into its e-commerce platform to promote customer loyalty and engagement. In addition, HSN.com has over 50,000 video demonstrations of products and how-to videos.
In an effort to promote its own differentiated brand, HSN seeks to provide its customers with unique products that can only be purchased through HSN. HSN frequently partners with leading personalities and brands to develop product lines exclusive to HSN and believes that these affiliations enhance the awareness of the HSN brand among consumers, as well as increase the extent to which HSN and/or products sold through HSN are featured in the media. In some cases, vendors have agreed to market their HSN affiliation to their existing customers (e.g., notifying customers when their products will be featured on the HSN television network).
Digital commerce, representing almost half of HSN's business, is an essential part of HSN's overall strategy to optimize its content across multiple distributed commerce platforms. We are able to utilize digital marketing efforts to prospect for new customers and re-engage former customers. HSN continues to invest in digital marketing strategies including online search engines, digital display ads and social media marketing.
HSN engages in co-promotional partnerships with major media companies. These are done primarily because they offer us editorial authority while they also secure print advertising in national fashion, style and/or lifestyle publications to market HSN to prospective customers in its target demographics. HSN also engages in targeted offline advertising. As part of HSN's entertainment strategy, it participates in innovative joint marketing and promotional partnerships with major motion picture companies as well as well-known recording artists. HSN also creates strategic alliances with world-class, consumer brands in an effort to reach new prospects through relevant brand integrations and occasion-based event marketing. These promotions are designed to not only generate additional revenue and create brand awareness, but to also provide unique experiences for our customers in our continued effort to drive customer engagement as well as position HSN as a proven and powerful marketing vehicle.

HSN's credit card program offers eligible customers a private label credit card. All cardholders receive certain rewards and benefits which are designed to recognize and promote customer loyalty. HSN designs, executes and administers marketing programs to promote usage of the card to current and potential customers. These marketing programs are funded largely by the sponsoring bank. Typically, customers using the HSN private label credit card shop with HSN more frequently, as well as spend more money per visit, than customers not using the card. In addition to fostering greater customer loyalty and driving more sales, HSN also saves on interchange fees that it would incur if its customers used third-party cards. Purchases made through the private label credit card represented 36%, 34% and 31% of HSN's business in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Certain brands in the Cornerstone portfolio also offer their customers private label credit cards with purchases representing approximately 4% of Cornerstone's sales in 2016.
The Cornerstone brands differentiate themselves by offering customers an assortment of innovative proprietary and branded apparel and home products. In many cases, Cornerstone seeks to secure exclusive distribution rights for certain products. Cornerstone employs in-house designers and partners with leading manufacturers and designers to aid in the development of its unique, exclusive product assortment. The Cornerstone brands use their respective websites and e-mail marketing to promote special offers, including cross-promotions for other Cornerstone brands. In addition, Cornerstone partners with third parties to offer promotional events such as sweepstakes and/or enter into other advertising agreements. HSNi believes that these affiliations enhance the awareness of the Cornerstone brands among consumers as well as strengthen its various brands overall. Cornerstone has also been extending its distributed commerce platform through both its experiential and more traditional retail and outlet stores, as a marketing tool to increase demand in the overall regions where the stores reside. 
Order Entry, Fulfillment and Customer Service
HSNi provides customers with convenient options in connection with the purchase, payment and shipment of merchandise, some of which may vary by brand, business or product. Merchandise may be purchased online, through mobile devices, or ordered using toll free phone numbers through live sales and service agents. HSN also offers the convenience of an automated attendant system and, in limited markets, remote control ordering capabilities through pay television set-top boxes. Cornerstone’s catalog orders can also be made via submission of traditional catalog sales order forms.
HSNi allows the customer to pay using traditional payment options (credit and certain debit cards), as well as evolving payment alternatives such as PayPal, VISA Checkout and Apple Pay. HSNi also offers other payment options including private label and co-branded credit cards and, in the case of HSN, Flexpay. By utilizing Flexpay, customers may pay for select merchandise in two to six interest-free, monthly credit or debit card payments. HSN also offers its customers the convenience of ordering products under its Autoship program, through which customers may arrange to have products automatically shipped and billed at scheduled intervals. Standard and express shipping options are available and customers may generally return most merchandise for a full refund or exchange in accordance with applicable return policies (which vary by brand and business). Returns generally must be received within specified time periods after purchase, ranging from a minimum of thirty days to a maximum of one year, depending upon the applicable policy.
HSNi seeks to fulfill customer orders and process returns quickly and accurately from a network of fulfillment centers. For HSN, these centers are located in Tennessee, California, Virginia and New York, and for Cornerstone, the fulfillment centers are located in Ohio and Arizona. As part of its supply chain optimization initiative, HSNi will be consolidating two of its fulfillment centers, resulting in the expected closure of the Virgina facility and transfer of its operations to its Tennessee fulfillment center. HSNi contracts with several third party carriers and other fulfillment partners for the delivery of products to its customers and processing of returns.
Through HSN.com and the various websites operated by Cornerstone or through HSNi’s common carriers, customers can also generally track the status of their orders, confirm information regarding shipping and, in some cases, confirm the availability of inventory and establish and manage personal accounts. Customers may communicate directly with customer service via e-mail or by telephone with call center representatives available seven days a week.
Government Regulation
We market and offer a broad range of merchandise through television, online, catalogs and other channels. The manner in which we promote and sell merchandise, including claims and representations made in connection with these efforts, is regulated by a wide variety of federal, state and local laws, regulations, rules, policies and procedures. Some examples of these that affect the manner in which we sell and promote merchandise or otherwise operate our businesses include, but are not limited to, the following:

• | The Federal Trade Commission’s regulations related to the sale of products and/or commercial contacts with our customers or potential customers, such as the Telemarketing Sales Rule and Do Not Call;

7


• | The Food and Drug Administration’s regulations regarding marketing claims that can be made about cosmetic beauty products and over-the-counter drugs, which include products for treating acne or medical products, and claims that can be made about food products;


• | Regulations related to product safety issues and product recalls including, but not limited to, the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, the Federal Hazardous Substance Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act and regulations promulgated pursuant to these acts; and


• | Various state laws, regulations and interpretations regarding the obligations of retailers with respect to the collection of sales tax on internet sales.

These laws, regulations, rules, policies and procedures are subject to change at any time. Unfavorable changes applicable to us could decrease demand for our merchandise, increase costs which we may not be able to offset, subject us to additional liabilities and/or otherwise adversely affect our businesses.
Since October 1996, HSN has been subject to a consent order issued by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, which terminates on the later of April 15, 2019, or 20 years from the most recent date that the United States or the FTC files a complaint in federal court alleging any violation thereunder. Pursuant to this consent order, we are prohibited from making claims for specified categories of products, including claims that a given product can cure, treat or prevent any disease or have an effect on the structure or function of the human body, unless we have competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate such claims. Violation of this consent order may result in the imposition of significant civil penalties for non-compliance and related redress to consumers and/or the issuance of an injunction enjoining us from engaging in prohibited activities. The FTC may periodically investigate our business and operations on an ongoing basis for purposes of determining our compliance with the consent order.
Online sales must comply with a variety of federal and state laws dealing with, amongst other things, privacy, intellectual property, taxation, the provision of online payment services and electronic contracts. While U.S. Supreme Court decisions generally restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales and use taxes with respect to sales from out-of-state retailers, an increasing number of states have adopted or are considering laws that would impose obligations on out-of-state retailers to collect taxes on their behalf. Congress is also considering legislation allowing states to require out-of-state sellers to collect sales and use taxes. An unfavorable change in U.S. Supreme Court guidance related to sales tax or a successful assertion by one or more states may result in material tax liabilities, interest and penalties. A change in state law or federal laws, our business model, business strategy or marketing initiatives may require us to collect sales tax in states for which we do not currently collect such tax. These developments, should they occur, may result in a decrease in future sales, may limit our ability to compete effectively or may otherwise harm our business. 
Programming and Interactive Television Services
Although HSN markets and sells consumer products through a variety of outlets, it does so, in large part, through live video programming services distributed by cable television systems, satellite systems and over-the-air broadcasters.  Consequently, regulation of programming services and the entities that distribute them can affect HSN.  In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") regulates broadcasters, the providers of satellite communications services and facilities for the transmission of programming services, the cable television systems and other multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs") that distribute such services, and, to some extent, the availability of the programming services themselves through its regulation of program licensing. Cable television systems in the United States are also regulated by municipalities or other state and local government authorities. Regulatory carriage requirements also could adversely affect the number of channels available to HSN.

Through Liberty Interactive Corporation's ownership interests in HSNi and in Charter Communications, Inc., the FCC attributes an ownership interest of Charter Communications, Inc. to HSNi, thereby subjecting us to various FCC rules regarding the distribution of video programming to MVPDs. These include, for example, the FCC's program access rules, which, in general, prohibit various unfair practices involving the distribution of video programming to MVPDs and its program carriage rules, which, among other things, prohibit cable operators from favoring affiliated programmers so as to restrain unreasonably the ability of unaffiliated programmers to compete. The FCC program access and program carriage rules also make provision for enforcement of alleged violations through complaint proceedings initiated by aggrieved entities.
While we believe that the practices of our businesses have been structured in a manner to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations; federal, state or local regulatory authorities may take a contrary position. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us, tax assessments, fines and penalties and/or a diminution of our reputation, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and businesses.

Intellectual Property
We regard our intellectual property rights, including patents, service marks, trademarks, domain names, copyrights and trade secrets, as important to our success. Our businesses also rely heavily upon software, informational databases and other systemic components that are necessary to manage and support our operations. We rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, licensees, affiliates and other third parties to establish and protect these proprietary rights. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use trade secrets or copyrighted intellectual property without authorization which, if discovered, might require legal action to correct. In addition, third parties may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar intellectual properties.
We have generally registered and continue to apply to register, or secure by contract when appropriate, our trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve and register domain names as we deem appropriate. We consider the protection of our trademarks to be important for purposes of brand maintenance and reputation. While we vigorously protect our trademarks, service marks and domain names, effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available, and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract. Similarly, not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered, even if available. Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in dilution of brand names and/or limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Some of our businesses have been granted patents and/or have patent applications pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and/or foreign patent authorities for various proprietary technologies and other inventions. We consider applying for patents or for other appropriate statutory protection when we develop or identify new or improved proprietary technologies or inventions, and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future proprietary technologies and inventions as circumstances may warrant. The issuance or assessment of the validity of any patent involves complex legal and factual questions, and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain. Accordingly, any patent application filed may not result in a patent being issued or existing or future patents may not be adjudicated valid by a court or be afforded adequate protection against competitors with similar technology. In addition, third parties may create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents that we own. Likewise, the issuance of a patent to us does not mean that our processes or inventions will not be found to infringe upon patents or other rights previously issued to third parties.
From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive.
Competition
HSNi brands and businesses operate in a highly competitive environment. These brands and businesses are in direct competition for consumers with traditional and online retailers (both television and digital retailers), ranging from large department stores to specialty shops, electronic retailers, direct marketing retailers, mail order and catalog companies, infomercial retailers, wholesale clubs and discount retailers. In addition, the HSN television networks compete for access to customers and audience share with other conventional forms of entertainment and content. The price and availability of programming for pay television systems affect the availability of distribution for HSN television programming. Principal competitive factors for HSNi brands and businesses include: (i) brand recognition, (ii) value, quality and selection of merchandise, (iii) customer experience, including customer service and reliability of fulfillment and delivery services and (iv) convenience and accessibility of sales channels.
Employees
As of January 19, 2017, HSNi employed approximately 6,500 employees. No HSNi employees are represented by unions or other similar organizations and HSNi considers its relations with its employees to be good.
