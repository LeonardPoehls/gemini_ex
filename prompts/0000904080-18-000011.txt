ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
The Company
Stone Energy is an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, exploitation, development and operation of oil and gas properties. We have been operating in the Gulf of Mexico (the “GOM”) Basin since our incorporation in 1993 and have established technical and operational expertise in this area. We leveraged our experience in the GOM conventional shelf and expanded our reserve base into the more prolific plays of the GOM deep water, Gulf Coast deep gas and the Marcellus and Utica shales in Appalachia. At December 31, 2016, we had producing properties and acreage in the Marcellus and Utica Shales in Appalachia. In connection with our restructuring efforts, we determined that a sale of the Appalachia Properties (as defined below) would be a beneficial way to maximize value for all stakeholders. We completed the sale of the Appalachia Properties on February 27, 2017 for net cash consideration of approximately $522.5 million. See “Reorganization and Emergence from Voluntary Chapter 11 Proceedings” below for additional information. As of December 31, 2017, our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves were approximately 32.5 MMBoe. 
We were incorporated in 1993 as a Delaware corporation. Our corporate headquarters are located at 625 E. Kaliste Saloom Road, Lafayette, Louisiana 70508. We have an additional office in New Orleans, Louisiana.
Business Strategy
Our long-term strategy is to grow net asset value through acquiring, discovering, developing and operating a focused set of margin-advantaged properties while appropriately managing financial, exploration and operational risk. Oil and natural gas prices significantly declined in the second half of 2014, and sustained lower prices continued throughout 2015, 2016 and early 2017, with a modest recovery in late 2017. In response to that decline and the uncertainty regarding future commodity prices, we adjusted our near-term strategy and focused on maintaining maximum liquidity. We structured a plan of reorganization to improve our financial position and liquidity and filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of Title 11 (“Chapter 11”) of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) on December 14, 2016 (the “Petition Date”). On February 28, 2017, we emerged from bankruptcy, and in April 2017, our board of directors retained a financial advisor to assist them in determining the Company’s strategic direction. See “Strategic Review and Pending Combination with Talos” below for additional details.
Strategic Review and Pending Combination with Talos
Following the successful completion of our financial restructuring and emergence from Chapter 11 reorganization, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) retained a financial advisor in April 2017 to assist the Board in its determination of the Company’s strategic direction, including assessing its various strategic alternatives. Pursuant to such process, on November 21, 2017, Stone and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a series of related agreements pertaining to a business combination with Talos Energy LLC (“Talos Energy”) and its indirect wholly owned subsidiary Talos Production LLC (“Talos Production” and, together with Talos Energy, “Talos”). Talos Energy is controlled indirectly by entities controlled by Apollo Management VII, L.P. (“Apollo VII”), Apollo Commodities Management, L.P., with respect to Series I (together with Apollo VII, “Apollo Management”) and Riverstone Energy Partners V, L.P. (“Riverstone”).

Under the terms of a definitive agreement, Talos and Stone will both become wholly-owned subsidiaries of a new holding company, which at closing will become a publicly traded entity named Talos Energy, Inc. (“New Talos”). The combination involves an all-stock transaction pursuant to which holders of Stone common stock immediately prior to the combination will collectively hold 37% of the outstanding New Talos common stock and the current Talos stakeholders will hold 63% of the outstanding New Talos common stock. Outstanding warrants to acquire Stone common stock will become warrants to acquire New Talos common stock with terms and conditions substantially identical to their existing terms and conditions. The combination is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018. We cannot provide any assurance that the combination will be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all. For additional details on the Talos combination, see Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Reorganization and Emergence from Voluntary Chapter 11 Proceedings
On the Petition Date, the Company and its subsidiaries Stone Energy Offshore, L.L.C. (“Stone Offshore”) and Stone Energy Holding, L.L.C. (together with the Company, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions (the “Bankruptcy Petitions”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the “Bankruptcy Court”) seeking relief under the provisions of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On February 15, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the “Confirmation Order”) confirming the Second Amended Joint Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization of Stone Energy Corporation and its Debtor Affiliates, dated December 28, 2016 (the “Plan”), as modified by the Confirmation Order, and on February 28, 2017, the Plan became effective (the “Effective Date”) and the Debtors emerged from bankruptcy, with the bankruptcy cases then being closed by Final Decree Closing Chapter 11 Cases and Terminating Claims Agent Services entered by the Bankruptcy Court on April 20, 2017.
Our restructuring included the sale of Stone’s producing properties and acreage, including approximately 86,000 net acres, in the Appalachia regions of Pennsylvania and West Virginia (the “Appalachia Properties”) to EQT Corporation, through its wholly-owned subsidiary EQT Production Company (“EQT”), on February 27, 2017, for net cash consideration of approximately $522.5 million. A portion of the consideration received from the sale of the Appalachia Properties was used to fund the Company’s cash payment obligations under the Plan. At December 31, 2016, the Appalachia Properties accounted for approximately 34% of the Predecessor Company’s (as defined below) total estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves, on a volume equivalent basis. Upon closing of the sale on February 27, 2017, we no longer have operations or assets in Appalachia.
The voluntary reorganization under Chapter 11 substantially reduced our indebtedness and restructured our balance sheet. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we eliminated approximately $1.1 billion in principal amount of outstanding debt. For additional details on the Chapter 11 proceedings, the sale of the Appalachia Properties and the terms of the Plan, see Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company adopted fresh start accounting in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 852, “Reorganizations”, which resulted in the Company becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes on the Effective Date. As a result of the adoption of fresh start accounting, the Company’s consolidated financial statements subsequent to February 28, 2017 will not be comparable to its financial statements prior to that date. See Note 3 – Fresh Start Accounting for further details on the impact of fresh start accounting on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. References to “Successor” or “Successor Company” relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to February 28, 2017. References to “Predecessor” or “Predecessor Company” relate to the financial position and results of operations of the Company prior to, and including, February 28, 2017.
Board of Director and Management Changes 
Pursuant to the Plan, upon the Effective Date, Neal P. Goldman (Chairman of the Board), John “Brad” Juneau, David I. Rainey, Charles M. Sledge, James M. Trimble and David N. Weinstein were appointed as directors of the Board of the Successor Company. In addition, David H. Welch, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company at the time of the Effective Date, was reappointed to the Board pursuant to the Plan. Mr. Welch retired as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and as a member of the Board on April 28, 2017. 
On April 28, 2017, the Board elected James M. Trimble, a member of the Board, to serve as the Company’s Interim Chief Executive Officer and President, and appointed Keith A. Seilhan, the Company’s Senior Vice President – Gulf of Mexico, to serve as the Company’s Chief Operating Officer. 
Operational Overview
Gulf of Mexico Basin
We have properties in the deep water of the GOM, as well as limited exposure to GOM conventional shelf and deep gas properties. In 2014, we sold a majority of our GOM conventional shelf properties. 
Gulf of Mexico — Deep Water.  We believe that the deep water of the GOM is an attractive area to acquire, explore, develop and operate with high-potential investment opportunities. We have made significant investments in seismic data and leasehold interests and have assembled a technical team with prior geological, geophysical, engineering and operational experience in the deep water arena to evaluate potential exploration, development and acquisition opportunities. Since 2006, we have made two significant acquisitions that included two deep water platforms, producing reserves and numerous leases. We have a portfolio of deep water projects ranging from lower risk development projects incorporating existing facilities to higher risk exploration 
2

prospects that would require a new production facility. We have utilized subsea tie-backs in the deep water on satellite discoveries close to existing facilities, which require less capital and time than new stand-alone facilities. We have higher risk exploration prospects that could expose the company to significant reserves, if successful. Projects in the deep water typically require substantially more time, planning, manpower and capital than an onshore project. Our deep water properties accounted for 86% of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2017, on a volume equivalent basis.
Gulf Coast — Conventional Shelf and Deep Gas.  We have historically focused on the GOM conventional shelf, but after the sale of a majority of our GOM conventional shelf properties in 2014, we have significantly reduced our exposure in this area to primarily two remaining fields, which provide production and cash flow. There are limited exploitation and exploration projects for us on our GOM conventional shelf properties. The Gulf Coast deep gas play (prospects below 15,000 feet) provides us with higher potential exploration opportunities with existing infrastructure nearby, which shortens the lead time to production. Our conventional shelf and deep gas properties accounted for 14% of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2017, on a volume equivalent basis.
Appalachia
Our restructuring included the sale of the Appalachia Properties to EQT on February 27, 2017, for net cash consideration of approximately $522.5 million. At December 31, 2016, the Appalachia Properties accounted for approximately 34% of the Predecessor Company’s total estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves, on a volume equivalent basis. Upon closing of the sale on February 27, 2017, we no longer have operations or assets in Appalachia.
Oil and Gas Marketing
Our oil and natural gas production is sold at current market prices under short-term contracts. Phillips 66 Company and Shell Trading (US) Company accounted for approximately 74% and 15%, respectively, of our oil and natural gas revenue generated during the period from March 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. We do not believe that the loss of any of our major purchasers would result in a material adverse effect on our ability to market future oil and natural gas production. From time to time, we may enter into transactions that hedge the price of oil and natural gas. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Commodity Price Risk.
Competition and Markets
Competition in the GOM Basin and onshore plays is intense, particularly with respect to the acquisition of producing properties and undeveloped acreage. We compete with major oil and gas companies and other independent producers of varying sizes, all of which are engaged in the acquisition of properties and the exploration and development of such properties. Many of our competitors have financial resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours, which may adversely affect our ability to compete. See Item 1A. Risk Factors – Competition within our industry may adversely affect our operations.
The availability of a ready market for and the price of any hydrocarbons produced will depend on many factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the amount of domestic production and imports of foreign oil and exports of liquefied natural gas, the marketing of competitive fuels, the proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines, the availability of transportation and other market facilities, the demand for hydrocarbons, the effect of federal and state regulation of allowable rates of production, taxation and the conduct of drilling operations and federal regulation of oil and natural gas. All of these factors, together with economic factors in the marketing arena, generally may affect the supply of and/or demand for oil and natural gas and thus the prices available for sales of oil and natural gas.
Regulation
Our oil and gas operations are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations.
Various aspects of our oil and natural gas operations are regulated by certain agencies of the federal government for our operations on federal leases. The jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions requiring permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, provisions relating to the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells that may be drilled in an area and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In this regard, some agencies can order the pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while others rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In addition, certain conservation laws establish maximum 
3

rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells.
Outer Continental Shelf Regulation. Our operations on federal oil and gas leases in the GOM are subject to regulation by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”) and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”). These leases contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed BSEE and BOEM regulations and orders issued pursuant to various federal laws, including the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. These laws and regulations are subject to change, and many new requirements, including those related to safety, permitting and performance, were imposed by the BSEE and BOEM subsequent to the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident. For offshore operations, lessees must obtain BOEM approval for exploration, development and production plans prior to the commencement of such operations. In addition to permits required from other agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), lessees must obtain a permit from the BSEE prior to the commencement of drilling and comply with regulations governing, among other things, engineering and construction specifications for production facilities, safety procedures, plugging and abandonment of wells on the Outer Continental Shelf (“OCS”), calculation of royalty payments and the valuation of production for this purpose, and removal of facilities. These rules are frequently subject to change. For example, in April 2016, BSEE published a final rule on well control that, among other things, imposes rigorous standards relating to the design, operation and maintenance of blow-out preventers, real-time monitoring of deepwater and high temperature, high pressure drilling activities, and enhanced reporting requirements. Pursuant to President Trump’s Executive Orders dated March 28, 2017, and April 28, 2017 (the “Executive Orders”), respectively, BSEE initiated a review of the well control regulations to determine whether the rules are consistent with the stated policy of encouraging energy exploration and production, while ensuring that any such activity is safe and environmentally responsible. On October 24, 2017, BSEE announced, in a report published by the Department of the Interior, that it is considering several revisions to the regulations and that it is in the process of determining the most effective way to engage stakeholders in the process.
Also, in April 2016, BOEM published a proposed rule that would update existing air emissions requirements relating to offshore oil and natural gas activity on the OCS. BOEM regulates these air emissions in connection with its review of exploration and development plans, rights of way and rights of use and/or easement applications. The proposed rule would bolster existing air emissions requirements by, among other things, requiring the reporting and tracking of the emissions of all pollutants defined by the EPA to affect human health and public welfare. Pursuant to the Executive Orders, BOEM is reviewing the proposed air quality rule. On October 24, 2017, the Department of the Interior announced that it is currently reviewing recommendations on how to proceed, including promulgating final rules for certain necessary provisions and issuing a new proposed rule that may withdraw certain provisions and seek additional input on others.
Compliance with new and future regulations could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business. In addition, under certain circumstances, BSEE may require Stone’s operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated. Any such suspension or termination could adversely affect our financial condition and operations.
Furthermore, hurricanes in the GOM can have a significant impact on oil and natural gas operations on the OCS. The effects from past hurricanes have included structural damage to fixed production facilities, semi-submersibles and jack-up drilling rigs. BOEM and BSEE continue to be concerned about the loss of these facilities and rigs as well as the potential for catastrophic damage to key infrastructure and the resultant pollution from future storms. In an effort to reduce the potential for future damage, BOEM and BSEE have periodically issued guidance aimed at improving platform survivability by taking into account environmental and oceanic conditions in the design of platforms and related structures. It is possible that similar, if not more stringent, requirements will be issued by BOEM and BSEE for future hurricane seasons. New requirements, if any, could increase Stone’s operating costs and/or capital expenditures.
In addition, in order to cover the various decommissioning obligations of lessees on the OCS, BOEM generally requires that lessees post some form of acceptable financial assurances that such obligations will be met, such as surety bonds. Historically, we have been able to obtain an exemption from most bonding requirements based on our financial net worth. However, on March 21, 2016, we received notice letters from BOEM stating that BOEM had determined that we no longer qualified for a supplemental bonding waiver under the financial criteria specified in BOEM’s guidance to lessees at that time. In late March 2016, we proposed a tailored plan to BOEM for financial assurances relating to our abandonment obligations, which provides for posting some incremental financial assurances in favor of BOEM. On May 13, 2016, we received notice letters from BOEM rescinding its demand for supplemental bonding with the understanding that we will continue to make progress with BOEM towards finalizing and implementing our long-term tailored plan. Currently, we have posted an aggregate of approximately $115 million in surety bonds in favor of BOEM, third-party bonds, and letters of credit, all relating to our offshore abandonment obligations. 
In July 2016, BOEM issued a new notice to lessees and operators (the “NTL”), with an effective date of September 12, 2016, that augments requirements for the posting of additional financial assurance by offshore lessees. The NTL details procedures to 
4

determine a lessee’s ability to carry out its lease obligations (primarily the decommissioning of OCS facilities) and whether to require lessees to furnish additional financial assurances to meet BOEM’s estimate of the lessees decommissioning obligations. The NTL supersedes the agency’s prior practice of allowing operators of a certain net worth to waive the need for supplemental bonds and provides updated criteria for determining a lessee’s ability to self-insure only a small portion of its OCS liabilities based upon the lessee’s financial capacity and financial strength. The NTL also allows lessees to meet their additional financial security requirements pursuant to an individually approved tailored plan, whereby an operator and BOEM agree to set a timeframe for the posting of additional financial assurances. 
We received a self-insurance letter from BOEM dated September 30, 2016 stating that we were not eligible to self-insure any of our additional security obligations. We received a proposal letter from BOEM dated October 20, 2016 indicating that additional security may be required. The September 30, 2016 self-insurance determination letter was rescinded by BOEM on March 24, 2017. BOEM has rescinded that order and all other sole-liability orders (i.e., orders related to properties for which there is no other current or prior owner who is liable) until further notice.
In the first quarter of 2017, BOEM announced that it would extend the implementation timeline for the July 2016 NTL by an additional six months. Furthermore, on April 28, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order directing the Secretary of the Interior to review the NTL to determine whether modifications are necessary to ensure operator compliance with lease terms while minimizing unnecessary regulatory burdens. On June 22, 2017, BOEM announced that, pending its review of the NTL, the implementation timeline would be indefinitely extended, subject to certain exceptions. At this time, it is uncertain when, or if, the July 2016 NTL will be implemented or whether a revised NTL might be proposed. Compliance with the NTL, or any other new rules, regulations, or legal initiatives by BOEM or other governmental authorities that impose more stringent requirements adversely affecting our offshore activities could delay or disrupt our operations, result in increased supplemental bonding and costs, limit our activities in certain areas, cause us to incur penalties or fines or to shut-in production at one or more of our facilities, or result in the suspension or cancellation of leases.
If fully implemented, the July 2016 NTL is likely to result in the loss of supplemental bonding waivers for a large number of operators on the OCS, which will in turn force these operators to seek additional surety bonds and could, consequently, challenge the surety bond market’s capacity for providing such additional financial assurance. Operators who have already leveraged their assets as a result of the declining oil market could face difficulty obtaining surety bonds because of concerns the surety companies may have about the priority of their lien on the operator’s collateral. All of these factors may make it more difficult for us to obtain the financial assurances required by BOEM to conduct operations on the OCS. These and other changes to BOEM bonding and financial assurance requirements could result in increased costs on our operations and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. See Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Natural Gas.  In 2005, the United States Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”). Among other matters, EPAct 2005 amends the Natural Gas Act (the “NGA”) to make it unlawful for “any entity”, including otherwise non-jurisdictional producers such as Stone Energy, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”), in contravention of rules prescribed by the FERC. In 2006, the FERC issued rules implementing this provision. The rules make it unlawful in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud, to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. EPAct 2005 also gives the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the NGA up to $1 million per day per violation. The anti-manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering but does apply to activities of otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. It therefore reflects a significant expansion of the FERC’s enforcement authority. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) has similar authority with respect to energy futures commodity markets. Stone Energy does not anticipate it will be affected any differently by these requirements than other producers of natural gas.
Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive regulation. The FERC has undertaken various initiatives to increase competition within the natural gas industry, including requiring interstate pipelines to provide firm and interruptible transportation service on an open access basis that is equal for all natural gas supplies. In addition, the natural gas pipeline industry is also subject to state regulations, which may change from time to time in ways that affect the availability, terms and cost of transportation. However, we do not believe that any such changes would affect our business in a way that would be materially different from the way such changes would affect our competitors.
5

Oil.  Effective November 4, 2009, pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) issued a rule prohibiting market manipulation in the petroleum industry. The FTC rule prohibits any person, directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of crude oil, gasoline or petroleum distillates at wholesale, from knowingly engaging in any act, practice or course of business, including the making of any untrue statement of material fact, that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person or intentionally failing to state a material fact that under the circumstances renders a statement made by such person misleading, provided that such omission distorts or is likely to distort market conditions for any such product. A violation of this rule may result in civil penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation, in addition to any applicable penalty under the FTC Act.
Our sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (“NGL”s) are not currently regulated and are transacted at market prices. In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act. The price we receive from the sale of oil and NGLs is affected by the cost of transporting those products to market. Interstate transportation rates for oil, NGLs and other products are regulated by the FERC. The FERC has established an indexing system for such transportation, which allows such pipelines to take an annual inflation-based rate increase.
In other instances, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to regulation by state regulatory bodies under state statutes. As it relates to intrastate crude oil, condensate and NGL pipelines, state regulation is generally less rigorous than the federal regulation of interstate pipelines. State agencies have generally not investigated or challenged existing or proposed rates in the absence of shipper complaints or protests, which are infrequent and are usually resolved informally.
We do not believe that the regulatory decisions or activities relating to interstate or intrastate crude oil, condensate and NGL pipelines will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other crude oil, condensate and NGL producers or marketers.
Miscellaneous.  Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by the United States Congress, state regulatory bodies, BOEM, BSEE, FERC and other federal regulatory bodies and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective. In the past, the oil and natural gas industry has been heavily regulated. We can give no assurance that the regulatory approach currently pursued by BOEM, BSEE, FERC or any other state or federal agency will continue indefinitely. 
Environmental Regulation
As a lessee and operator of offshore oil and gas properties in the United States, we are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, worker health and safety, and natural resources, as well as controlling the manner in which various substances, including wastes generated in connection with oil and gas industry operations, are released into the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to obtain permits authorizing air emissions and wastewater discharge from operations and can affect the location or size of wells and facilities, limit or prohibit the extent to which exploration and development may be allowed, and require proper closure of wells and restoration of properties that are being abandoned. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, imposition of remedial obligations, incurrence of capital costs to comply with governmental standards, and even injunctions that limit or prohibit exploration and production operations or the disposal of substances generated in connection with oil and gas industry operation. The following is a summary of some of the existing laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject.
Hazardous Substances and Waste Management.  The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (the “RCRA”) generally regulates the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and imposes certain environmental cleanup obligations. Although RCRA specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste “drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy,” the EPA and state agencies may regulate these wastes as solid wastes. In addition, in December 2016, the EPA and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The consent decree requires the EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If the EPA proposes rulemaking for revised oil and gas regulations, the consent decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Also, in the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint 
6

wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste oils that may be regulated as hazardous wastes if such wastes have hazardous characteristics. 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.  The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the “CERCLA”, or the “Superfund Law”) and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. Such “responsible persons” may be subject to joint and several liability under the Superfund Law for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. Further, it is not uncommon for coastal landowners or other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
We currently operate or lease, and have in the past operated or leased, a number of properties that for many years have been used in operations related to the exploration and production of oil and gas. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties operated or leased by us or on or under other locations where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose storage, treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or wastes was not under our control. These properties and the hydrocarbons and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to laws and regulations imposing strict, joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, that could require us to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or environmental contamination, or to perform remedial plugging or pit closure to prevent future contamination.
Oil Pollution Act.  The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) holds owners and operators of offshore oil production or handling facilities, including the lessee or permittee of the area where an offshore facility is located, strictly liable for the costs of removing oil discharged into waters of the United States and for certain damages from such spills. OPA assigns joint and several strict liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for all containment and oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil, natural resource damages and economic damages suffered by persons adversely affected by an oil spill. Although defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA, they are limited. In addition, BOEM has finalized rules raising OPA’s damages liability cap from $75 million to $134 million. OPA also requires responsible parties to maintain evidence of financial responsibility in prescribed amounts. OPA currently requires a minimum financial responsibility demonstration of between $35 million to $150 million for companies operating on the OCS, although BOEM may increase this amount in certain situations. From time to time, the United States Congress has proposed amendments to OPA raising the financial responsibility requirements. If OPA is amended to increase the minimum level of financial responsibility, we may experience difficulty in providing financial assurances sufficient to comply with this requirement. We cannot predict at this time whether OPA will be amended or whether the level of financial responsibility required for companies operating on the OCS will be increased. In any event, if an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge were to occur, we may be liable for costs and damages, which costs and liabilities could be material to our results of operations and financial position.
National Environmental Policy Act. The National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to consider the impacts their actions have on the human environment, and to prepare detailed statements for major federal actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. These requirements can lead to additional costs and delays in permitting for operators as the Department of the Interior or its bureaus may need to prepare Environmental Assessments (“EA”) and more detailed Environmental Impact Statements (“EIS”) in support of its leasing and other activities that have the potential to significantly affect the quality of the environment. If the EA indicates that no significant impact is likely, then the agency can release a finding of no significant impact and carry on with the proposed action. Otherwise, the agency must then conduct a full-scale EIS. The NEPA process involves public input through comment. These comments, as well as the agency’s analysis of the proposed project, can result in changes to the nature of a proposed project, such as by limiting the scope of the project or requiring resource-specific mitigation. The adequacy of the agency’s NEPA process can be challenged in federal court by process participants. This process may result in delaying the permitting and development of projects, and result in increased costs.
Climate Change.  From time to time, the United States Congress has considered a variety of tax, energy-related or environmental market-based mechanisms to promote or induce the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) by several commercial or industrial sectors. In addition, more than one half of the states already have begun implementing legal measures such as renewable energy requirements or cap and trade programs to reduce emissions of GHGs.
Additionally, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that, in December 2015, agreed to the Paris Agreement, an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets. The Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016. In June 2017, President Trump stated that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement,

but may enter into a future international agreement related to GHGs. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States’ adherence to the exit process is uncertain and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.
In addition, the EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA began adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act (the “CAA”). The EPA adopted two sets of rules regulating GHG emissions under the CAA, one of which requires a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources through preconstruction and operating permit requirements. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States, on an annual basis. 
Recent regulation of GHGs has focused on fugitive methane emissions. For example, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules that established new air emission controls for emissions of methane from certain equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. The EPA’s rule package includes first-time standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions. However, in a March 28, 2017 executive order, President Trump directed the EPA to review the 2016 regulations and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise them consistent with the stated policy of promoting clean and safe development of the nation’s energy resources, while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production. On June 16, 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay for two years certain requirements of the 2016 regulations, including fugitive emission requirements. The regulations will remain in effect unless revised or repealed by separate EPA rulemaking in the future, which is likely to be challenged in court.
The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or to comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Substantial limitations on greenhouse gas emissions could also adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce and lower the value of our reserves. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. Our offshore operations are particularly at risk from severe climatic events. If any such climate changes were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations.
Water discharges.  Stone’s discharges into waters of the United States are limited by the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and analogous state laws. The CWA prohibits any discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States, except in compliance with permits issued by federal and state governmental agencies. These discharge permits also include monitoring and reporting obligations. Failure to comply with the CWA, including discharge limits set by permits issued pursuant to the CWA, may also result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions. Violations of the CWA can result in suspension, debarment or the imposition of statutory disability, each of which prevents companies and individuals from participating in government contracts and receiving some non-procurement government benefits. The CWA also requires the preparation of oil spill response plans and spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans.
Air emissions.  The CAA and comparable state statutes restrict the emission of air pollutants and affect both onshore and offshore oil and natural gas operations. New facilities may be required to obtain separate construction and operating permits before construction work can begin or operations may start, and existing facilities may be required to incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. Also, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, more stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants, and is considering the regulation of additional air pollutants and air pollutant parameters. For example, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant.
Worker Health and Safety. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. The OSHA hazard communication standard requires maintenance of information 
8

about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and provision of such information to employees. Other OSHA standards regulate specific worker safety aspects of our operations. Failure to comply with OSHA requirements can lead to the imposition of penalties.
Endangered Species. The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered and threatened species or their habitats. Additionally, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (“MBTA”) implements various treaties and conventions between the United States and certain other nations for the protection of migratory birds. Under the MBTA, the taking, killing or possessing of migratory birds is unlawful without a permit, though, in December 2017, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the “USFWS”) provided guidance limiting the reach of the MBTA. The Marine Mammal Protection Act similarly prohibits the taking of marine mammals without authorization. We conduct operations on oil and natural gas leases in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist and where other species that potentially could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA may exist. Historically, our compliance costs for the protection of marine species have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future. The USFWS or the National Marine Fisheries Service may designate critical habitat that it believes is necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and may materially delay or prohibit access to protected areas for oil and natural gas development. These statutes may result in operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal or permanent ban in affected areas.
We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures on a regular basis relating to environmental compliance. Although we maintain pollution insurance to cover a portion of the costs of cleanup operations, public liability and physical damage, there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover all such costs or that such insurance will continue to be available in the future. To date, we believe that our expenditures related to compliance with existing environmental requirements has not had a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. However, we also believe that it is reasonably likely that the historical trend in environmental legislation and regulation will continue toward stricter standards and, thus, we cannot give any assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future. Such costs may result in increased costs of operations and acquisitions and decreased production, and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
We have established internal guidelines to be followed in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the United States. We employ a safety, environmental and regulatory department whose responsibilities include providing assurance that our operations are carried out in accordance with applicable environmental guidelines and safety precautions and track regulatory developments applicable to our operations, such as the ones described in the paragraphs above. 
Employees
On March 9, 2018, we had 158 full-time employees. We believe that our relationships with our employees are satisfactory. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We utilize the services of independent contractors to perform various daily operational duties.
