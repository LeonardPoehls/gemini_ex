Item 1. Business. 
Overview
La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies intended to significantly improve outcomes in patients suffering from life-threatening diseases.
GIAPREZATM (angiotensin II), formerly known as LJPC-501, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 21, 2017 as a vasoconstrictor to increase blood pressure in adults with septic or other distributive shock. GIAPREZA is our first commercial product.
LJPC-401, a clinical-stage investigational product, is our proprietary formulation of synthetic human hepcidin. LJPC-401 is being developed for the potential treatment of conditions characterized by iron overload, such as hereditary hemochromatosis, beta thalassemia, sickle cell disease and myelodysplastic syndrome.
GIAPREZATM (angiotensin II)
GIAPREZATM (angiotensin II), injection for intravenous infusion, was approved by the FDA on December 21, 2017 as a vasoconstrictor indicated to increase blood pressure in adults with septic or other distributive shock. Angiotensin II is the major bioactive component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The RAAS is one of three central regulators of blood pressure. 
There are approximately 800,000 distributive shock cases in the U.S. each year. Of these cases, an estimated 90% are septic shock patients. Approximately 300,000 patients do not achieve adequate blood pressure response with initial vasopressor therapy and require additional therapy for low blood pressure. The Center for Disease Control estimates that approximately 250,000 people in the U.S. die each year from septic shock. The inability to achieve or maintain adequate blood pressure results in inadequate blood flow to the body’s organs and tissue and is associated with a mortality rate exceeding most acute conditions requiring hospitalization.
In March 2015, we initiated a Phase 3 study of GIAPREZA in adult patients with septic or other distributive shock who remain hypotensive despite fluid and vasopressor therapy, known as the ATHOS-3 (Angiotensin II for the Treatment of High-Output Shock) Phase 3 study. In ATHOS-3, patients were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either: (i) GIAPREZA plus standard-of-care vasopressors; or (ii) placebo plus standard-of-care vasopressors. Randomized patients received their assigned treatment via continuous IV infusion for up to 7 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients with a MAP ≥ 75 mmHg or a 10 mmHg increase from baseline MAP at three hours following the initiation of study treatment without an increase in standard-of-care vasopressors.
The ATHOS-3 Phase 3 study completed enrollment of 344 patients in the fourth quarter of 2016. In February 2017, we reported positive top-line results from ATHOS-3. In May 2017, the results of ATHOS-3 were published by The New England Journal of Medicine.
The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, defined as the percentage of patients achieving a pre-specified target blood pressure response, was highly statistically significant: 23% of the 158 placebo-treated patients had a blood pressure response compared to 70% of the 163 GIAPREZA-treated patients (p<0.00001). In addition, a trend toward longer survival was observed: 22% reduction in mortality risk through day 28 [hazard ratio=0.78 (0.57-1.07), p=0.12] for GIAPREZA-treated patients.
Throughout ATHOS-3, safety outcomes were followed by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The DSMB recommended that the study continue as originally planned. In this critically ill patient population: 92% of placebo-treated patients compared to 87% of GIAPREZA-treated patients experienced at least one adverse event, and 22% of placebo-treated patients compared to 14% of GIAPREZA-treated patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.

In September 2017, an analysis from ATHOS-3 entitled “Baseline angiotensin levels and ACE effects in patients with vasodilatory shock treated with angiotensin II” was presented during the 30th European Society of Intensive Care Medicine Annual Congress. The pre-specified analysis showed that a relatively low angiotensin II state (as measured by the ratio of angiotensin I to angiotensin II) predicted increased mortality in patients with vasodilatory shock, suggesting that a low angiotensin II state is a negative prognostic indicator of outcomes. Furthermore, the analysis showed a statistically significant treatment effect of GIAPREZA compared to placebo on mortality in these patients with a relatively low angiotensin II state (relative risk reduction of 36%; HR=0.64; 95% CI: 0.41-1.00; p=0.047).
In September 2017, we reported that the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued favorable Scientific Advice regarding the EU regulatory pathway for GIAPREZA. Based on this Advice, we intend to submit a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for GIAPREZA in the third quarter of 2018.
On December 21, 2017, the FDA approved GIAPREZA to increase blood pressure in adults with septic or other distributive shock.
LJPC-401
LJPC-401, a clinical-stage investigational product, is our proprietary formulation of synthetic human hepcidin. Hepcidin, an endogenous peptide hormone, is the body’s naturally occurring regulator of iron absorption and distribution. In healthy individuals, hepcidin prevents excessive iron accumulation in vital organs, such as the liver and heart, where it can cause significant damage and even result in death. We are developing LJPC-401 for the potential treatment of iron overload, which occurs as a result of diseases such as hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), beta thalassemia, sickle cell disease (SCD) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
HH is a disease characterized by a genetic deficiency in hepcidin. HH is the most common genetic disease in Caucasians and causes liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, heart disease and/or failure, diabetes, arthritis and joint pain. The current standard treatment for HH is a blood removal procedure known as phlebotomy. Each phlebotomy procedure, which is usually conducted at a hospital, medical office or blood center, typically involves the removal of approximately a pint of blood. The required frequency of procedures varies by patient but often ranges from one to two times per week for an initial period after diagnosis and once every one to three months for life. Since most of the body’s iron is stored in red blood cells, chronic removal of blood can effectively lower iron levels if a phlebotomy regimen is adhered to. However, phlebotomy procedures may cause and may be associated with pain, bruising and scarring at the venous puncture site, fatigue and dizziness during and following the procedure and disruption of daily activities. Furthermore, phlebotomy is not appropriate in patients with poor venous access, anemia or heart disease.
Beta thalassemia, SCD and MDS are genetic diseases of the blood that can cause life-threatening anemia and usually require frequent and life-long blood transfusions. These blood transfusions cause excessive iron accumulation in the body, which is toxic to vital organs, such as the liver and heart. In addition, the underlying anemia causes excessive iron accumulation independent of blood transfusions.
In 2015, the EMA Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) designated LJPC-401 as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of beta thalassemia intermedia and major. In 2016, the EMA COMP designated LJPC-401 as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of SCD.
In September 2016, we reported positive results from a Phase 1 study of LJPC-401 in patients at risk of iron overload suffering from HH, thalassemia and SCD. In this study, single, escalating doses of LJPC-401 were associated with a dose-dependent, statistically significant reduction in serum iron. LJPC-401 was well-tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities. Injection-site reactions were the most commonly reported adverse event and were all mild or moderate in severity, self-limiting and fully resolved.
In September 2016, we reached agreement with the EMA on the design of a pivotal study of LJPC-401 for the treatment of beta thalassemia patients suffering from iron overload, a major unmet need in an orphan patient population. This study, which we refer to as LJ401-BT01, was initiated in December 2017. LJ401-BT01 is designed to enroll approximately 100 patients across 9 countries, including the U.S. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either: (i) weekly subcutaneous injections of LJPC‑401, while continuing standard-of-care chelation therapy (LJPC‑401 treatment arm); or (ii) a continuation of standard-of-care chelation therapy only (observation arm). After 6 months of treatment, patients randomized to the observation arm will cross over to receive LJPC‑401 (plus standard-of-care chelation therapy) for 6 months, while patients randomized to 
2

the LJPC-401 treatment arm will continue with LJPC-401 (plus standard-of-care chelation therapy) for an additional 6 months (for a total of one year). The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is the change in iron content in the heart after 6 months, as measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). If this study is successful, we would anticipate filing an MAA for LJPC-401 in Europe.
In December 2017, we announced the initiation of LJ401-HH01, a Phase 2 clinical study of LJPC‑401 in patients with HH. LJ401-HH01 is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, Phase 2 study that is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LJPC-401 as a treatment for HH. Approximately 60 patients will be randomized to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of either LJPC‑401 or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the change in transferrin saturation, a standard measurement of iron levels in the body and one of the two key measurements used to detect iron overload, from baseline to end of treatment. Secondary efficacy endpoints include: (i) the change in serum ferritin, the other key measurement used to detect iron overload, from baseline to end of treatment; and (ii) the requirement for and frequency of phlebotomy procedures used during the study.
Manufacturing
We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of commercial or clinical quantities of GIAPREZA or any of our product candidates. We rely on a small number of third-party manufacturers to produce our compounds and expect to continue to do so to meet our commercial needs and the requirements of our product candidates.
In order to meet our commercial needs, we are currently negotiating or have entered into long-term commercial supply agreements with certain third-party manufacturers. Historically, we have not had long-term agreements with any third parties and will likely continue to not have long-term arrangements as they relate to our clinical and preclinical product candidates. In all of our manufacturing and processing agreements, we require that third-party contract manufacturers produce active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and finished products in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and all other applicable laws and regulations. We maintain confidentiality agreements with potential and existing manufacturers in order to protect our proprietary rights related to our product and product candidates.
With regard to GIAPREZA, we have utilized third parties to manufacture the API, formulate, fill and finish, and perform the analytical release testing of the drug product. We have also completed our commercial scale-up of manufacturing process development and the validation of commercial production runs. The commercial success of GIAPREZA will depend in part on the ability of our contract manufacturers to produce cGMP-compliant API and drug product in commercial quantities and at competitive costs. Further, some of the critical materials and components used in manufacturing GIAPREZA are sourced from single suppliers. An interruption in the supply of key materials could significantly delay our sales or increase our expenses. 
We plan to continue to scale up manufacturing through multiple third-party manufacturers as required, with the objectives of realizing important economies of scale and security of supply. These scale-up activities will take time to implement, require additional capital investment, process development, validation and FDA review.
Patents and Proprietary Technologies 
Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. As part of our strategy to protect our current product and product candidates and to provide a foundation for future products, we have filed a number of patent applications and have licensed rights from third parties for other patent applications related to our product candidates.
As of December 31, 2017, we owned or had the rights to 24 issued patents (12 U.S. and 12 foreign) and 109 pending applications (36 U.S. and 73 foreign). These patents and patent applications owned or licensed by us cover GIAPREZA, LJPC-401 and other product candidates.

 | United States | Foreign
Description | Issued | Pending | Expiration | Issued | Pending | Expiration 
GIAPREZA | 3 | 10 | 2029 - 2038 | — | 42 | 2034 - 2037
LJPC-401 | 2 | 8 | 2022 - 2038 | 5 | 6 | 2022 - 2037
Other | 7 | 18 | 2022 - 2038 | 7 | 25 | 2022 - 2037

In addition to those above, we plan to file additional patent applications that, if issued, would provide further protection for GIAPREZA and LJPC-401. Although we believe the bases for these patents and patent applications are sound, they are untested, and there is no assurance that they will not be successfully challenged. There can be no assurance that any patent previously issued will be of commercial value, that any patent applications will result in issued patents of commercial value, or that our technology will not be held to infringe patents held by others.
Material Contract
In December 2014, the Company entered into a patent license agreement with the George Washington University (GW), which the parties amended and restated on March 1, 2016. Pursuant to the amended and restated license agreement, GW exclusively licensed to the Company certain intellectual property rights relating to GIAPREZA, including the exclusive rights to certain issued patents and patent applications covering GIAPREZA. Under the license agreement, the Company is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, commercialize, market and sell GIAPREZA. The Company has paid a one-time license initiation fee, annual maintenance fees, an amendment fee and additional payments following the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones, including FDA approval. The Company may be obligated to make additional milestone payments of up to $1.6 million in the aggregate. Following the commencement of commercial sales of GIAPREZA, the Company is obligated to pay tiered royalties in the low- to mid-single digits on products covered by the licensed rights. The patents and patent applications covered by the GW license agreement expire between 2029 and 2038, and the obligation to pay royalties under this agreement extend through the last-to-expire patent covering GIAPREZA. 
Sales and Marketing
Our U.S.-based sales and marketing team consisted of 130 employees as of February 16, 2018. The sales and marketing infrastructure includes marketing, commercial insights, commercial operations and sales training. La Jolla has deployed a hospital market access team, clinical nurse educator team and specialized hospital sales team to focus on a targeted group of hospitals and hospital systems that treat high rates of distributive shock. These teams work to educate critical care physicians, ICU nurses and hospital pharmacists, with the goal of ensuring that they understand the clinical value of, and adopt, GIAPREZA as part of their clinical pathway for the management of distributive shock.
Customers
GIAPREZA is distributed in the U.S. through a limited number of specialty distributors that subsequently resell GIAPREZA to hospitals. Due to the relatively short lead-time required to fill orders for our product, backlog is not material to our business. We have engaged a third-party logistics service provider to act as our logistics and supply-chain manager for the commercial distribution of GIAPREZA to our specialty-distributor customers.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid technological change. Competition from domestic and foreign biotechnology companies, large pharmaceutical and specialty pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies and other institutions, is intense and expected to increase. A number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals in our targeted areas. However, we are not currently aware of any other angiotensin II drug product in development. We believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of GIAPREZA, as well as future product candidates that we may develop, are: efficacy, safety and tolerability profiles; convenience in dosing; and price and reimbursement.
Government Regulation
Pharmaceutical Regulation
Pharmaceutical products in the U.S., including GIAPREZA, are subject to extensive government regulation. Likewise, if we seek to market and distribute products abroad, they would also be subject to extensive foreign government regulation.
In the U.S., the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products. FDA regulations govern the testing, research and development activities, manufacturing, quality, storage, advertising, promotion, labeling, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. Accordingly, there is a rigorous process for the approval of new drugs and ongoing oversight of marketed products. We are also subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and drug products if products are tested or marketed abroad. The approval process outside the U.S. varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the time required may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.

See Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our development of commercial products and industry regulation.
Regulation in the U.S.

The FDA testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and money. We cannot assure you that any of our product candidates will ever obtain approval. The FDA approval process for new drugs includes, without limitation:

• | preclinical studies;


• | submission in the U.S. of an IND for clinical trials conducted in the U.S.;


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy of the product;


• | review of an NDA in the U.S.; and


• | inspection of the facilities used in the manufacturing of the drug to assess compliance with the FDA’s current cGMP regulations.

The FDA monitors the progress of trials conducted in the U.S. under an IND and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s benefit-risk assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. The FDA may also withdraw approval for an IND for that drug if deemed warranted. Furthermore, even after regulatory approval is obtained, under certain circumstances, such as later discovery of previously unknown problems, the FDA can withdraw approval or subject the drug to additional restrictions.
Preclinical Testing
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the product, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and effectiveness of the product. Most of these studies must be performed according to Good Laboratory Practices, a system of management controls for laboratories and research organizations to ensure the consistency and reliability of results. 
An IND is the request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The IND includes information regarding the preclinical studies, the investigational product’s chemistry and manufacturing, supporting data and literature, and the investigational plan and protocol(s). Clinical trials may begin 30 days after an IND is received, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trials. If concerns or questions are raised, an IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials begin. 
Clinical Trials

Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate that is the subject of the trial to volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator and in accordance with a clinical trial protocol, which sets forth details, such as the study objectives and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (IRB) in the U.S. or ethics committee in the European Union (EU) at each institution at which the study will be conducted. The IRB or ethics committee will consider, among other things, ethical factors, safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution arising from the conduct of the proposed clinical trial. In addition, clinical trials in the U.S. must be performed according to good clinical practices, which are enumerated in FDA regulations and guidance documents. Some studies include oversight by an independent group of experts, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether a study may move forward based on certain data from the study and may stop the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or on other grounds.
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.

5

Clinical trials in the U.S. typically are conducted in sequential phases: Phases 1, 2, 3 and 4. The phases may overlap. The FDA may require that we suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including if the FDA makes a finding that the subjects participating in the trial are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 

In Phase 1 clinical trials, the investigational product is usually tested on a small number of healthy volunteers to determine safety, any adverse effects, proper dosage, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and other drug effects. Phase 1b clinical trials may also evaluate efficacy with respect to trial participants.
In Phase 2 clinical trials, the investigational product is usually tested on a limited number of patients (generally up to several hundred) to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted indications, determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning Phase 3 clinical studies and support proof of concept. 

In Phase 3 clinical studies, the investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to support efficacy claims, provide evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple clinical sites.

In Phase 4 clinical studies or other post-approval commitments, additional studies and patient follow-up are conducted to gain experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. FDA may require a commitment to conduct post-approval Phase 4 studies as a condition of approval. Additional studies and follow-up may be conducted to document a clinical benefit where drugs are approved under accelerated approval regulations and based on surrogate endpoints. In clinical trials, surrogate endpoints are alternative measurements of the symptoms of a disease or condition that are substituted for measurements of observable clinical symptoms. Failure to timely conduct Phase 4 clinical trials and follow-up could result in withdrawal of approval for products approved under accelerated approval regulations. 
We cannot assure you that any of our current or future clinical studies will result in approval to market our product candidates.

Clinical Data Review and Approval in the U.S.
The data from the clinical studies, together with preclinical data and other supporting information that establishes a product candidate’s safety, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA, or NDA supplement (for approval of a new indication if the product candidate is already approved for another indication). Under applicable laws and FDA regulations, FDA reviews the NDA within 60 days of receipt of the NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on FDA’s threshold determination that the NDA is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If deemed complete, the FDA will “file” the NDA, thereby triggering substantive review of the application. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable.

The FDA has established internal substantive review goals of ten months for most NDAs. The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for approval based on surrogate endpoints. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs to treat serious diseases and fill an unmet medical need. The request may be made at the time of IND submission and generally no later than the pre-NDA meeting. The FDA will respond within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Priority review, which is requested at the time of an NDA submission, is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten months. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides an earlier approval of drugs to treat serious diseases, and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. The FDA, however, is not legally required to complete its review within these periods, and these performance goals may change over time.
If the FDA approves the NDA, it will issue an approval letter authorizing the commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use. Additionally, the FDA 
6

will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. In many cases, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, is not an actual approval, but a “complete response” that generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission, which may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter.

Satisfaction of FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local, and foreign regulatory agencies typically take several years and requires the expenditure of substantial financial resources. Information generated in this process is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval at any stage of the process. Accordingly, the actual time and expense required to bring a product to market may vary substantially. We cannot assure you that we will submit applications for required authorizations to manufacture and/or market potential products or that any such application will be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities in a timely manner, if at all. Data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Success in early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage clinical trials. Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or have conditions placed on it that restrict the commercial applications, advertising, promotion or distribution of these products.
Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory standards are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety or effectiveness of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. The FDA may also request or require additional Phase 4 clinical trials after a product is approved. The results of Phase 4 clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information to augment the FDA’s voluntary adverse drug reaction reporting system. Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements on us and our third-party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we, or our present or future suppliers, will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements.

In addition, both before and after approval is sought, we are required to comply with a number of FDA requirements. For example, we are required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with certain limitations and other requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with continuing cGMP. In addition, discovery of problems, such as safety problems, may result in changes in labeling or restrictions on a product manufacturer or NDA holder, including removal of the product from the market.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs. Approval may be subject to post-marketing surveillance and other record-keeping and reporting obligations, and involve ongoing requirements. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. 

Clinical Trial Conduct and Product Approval Regulation in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions

In addition to regulations in the U.S., we may be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Our clinical trials conducted in the EU must be done under a clinical trial application (CTA), which must be supported by an Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier (IMPD), and the oversight of an ethics committee. If we market our products in foreign countries, we also will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing marketing approval for pharmaceutical products. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product approval, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained before manufacturing or marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time required for such 
7

approvals may differ substantially from that required for FDA approval. There is no assurance that any future FDA approval of any of our product candidates will result in similar foreign approvals or vice versa. The process for clinical trials in the EU is similar, and trials are heavily scrutinized by the designated ethics committee.
Section 505(b)(2) Applications
Some of our product candidates may be eligible for submission of applications for approval under the FDA’s Section 505(b)(2) approval process, which provides an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, and allows approval of NDAs that rely, at least in part, on studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant and to which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Such studies can be provided by published literature, or the FDA can rely on previous findings of safety and efficacy for a previously approved drug. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA's previous approval is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical studies or clinical trials of the new product. Section 505(b)(2) applications may be submitted for drug products that represent a modification (e.g., a new indication or new dosage form) of an eligible approved drug. In such cases, the additional information in 505(b)(2) applications necessary to support the change from the previously approved drug is frequently provided by new studies submitted by the applicant. Because a Section 505(b)(2) application relies in part on previous studies or previous FDA findings of safety and effectiveness, preparing 505(b)(2) applications is generally less costly and time-consuming than preparing an NDA based entirely on new data and information from a full set of clinical trials. The FDA may approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. The law governing Section 505(b)(2) or FDA’s current policies may change in such a way as to adversely affect our applications for approval that seek to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) approach. Such changes could result in additional costs associated with additional studies or clinical trials and delays.
The FDA provides that reviews and/or approvals of applications submitted under Section 505(b)(2) will be delayed in various circumstances. For example, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of market exclusivity during which the FDA will not approve, and may not even review, a Section 505(b)(2) application from other sponsors. If the listed drug is claimed by one or more patents that the NDA holder has listed with the FDA, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must submit a certification with respect to each such patent. If the 505(b)(2) applicant certifies that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed by the product that is the subject of the Section 505(b)(2) application, it must notify the patent holder and the NDA holder. If, within 45 days of providing this notice, the NDA holder sues the 505(b)(2) applicant for patent infringement, the FDA will not approve the Section 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of a court decision favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant or the expiration of 30 months. The regulations governing marketing exclusivity and patent protection are complex, and it is often unclear how they will be applied in particular circumstances.
Drug Enforcement Agency Regulation
Our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals. Some of these hazardous materials are considered to be controlled substances and subject to regulation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). Controlled substances are those drugs that appear on one of five schedules promulgated and administered by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The CSA governs, among other things, the distribution, recordkeeping, handling, security and disposal of controlled substances. We must be registered by the DEA in order to engage in these activities, and are subject to periodic and ongoing inspections by the DEA and similar state drug enforcement authorities to assess ongoing compliance with the DEA’s regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could lead to a variety of sanctions, including the revocation, or a denial of renewal, of the DEA registration, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties.

Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
Commercial success of GIAPREZA, and any of our other product candidates that are approved or commercialized for any indication will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors at the federal, state and private levels. Government payor programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private healthcare insurance companies and managed care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments. The U.S. Congress and state legislatures, from time to time, propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment. Ongoing federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid payment systems.

Examples of how limits on drug coverage and reimbursement in the U.S. may cause reduced payments for drugs in the future include:

• | changing Medicare reimbursement methodologies;


• | fluctuating decisions on which drugs to include in formularies;


• | revising drug rebate calculations under the Medicaid program or requiring that new or additional rebates be provided to Medicare, Medicaid, other federal or state healthcare programs; and


• | reforming drug importation laws.

Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and to operate profitably.
Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and, within some countries, by region. Reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In many foreign markets, including markets in which we hope to sell our products, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government pricing control. In these markets, once marketing approval is received, pricing negotiations could take significant additional time. As in the U.S., the lack of satisfactory reimbursement or inadequate government pricing of any of our products would limit widespread use and lower potential product revenues.
Anti-Kickback, Fraud and Abuse and False Claims Regulation

On commercial launch of a product in the U.S., we will be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. 
Regulations under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the federal healthcare programs’ Anti-Kickback Law, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral or purchase of any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced-price items and services. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state healthcare programs as well as private payors. In addition, the False Claims Act (FCA) imposes liability on persons who, among other things, present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. 
The risk of being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Moreover, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened many of these laws. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes to clarify that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, PPACA provides that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. 
The continuing interpretation and application of these laws could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to compete should we commence marketing a product.

Federal and State Sunshine Laws 
We must comply with federal “sunshine” laws that require transparency regarding financial arrangements with healthcare providers. This would include the reporting and disclosure requirements imposed by the PPACA on drug manufacturers regarding any “payment or transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals. Failure to submit required information can result in civil monetary penalties. A number of states have laws that require the implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices, and/or require pharmaceutical companies to track and report payments, gifts and other benefits provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1997 (FCPA). The FCPA and other similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties, or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity by U.S. regulators, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the SEC. A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or government investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence. 
Patient Privacy and Data Security
We are required to comply, as applicable, with numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, and to govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. In addition, most healthcare providers who may prescribe products we may sell in the future and from whom we may obtain patient health information are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and its implementing regulations. We are not a HIPAA covered entity, do not currently intend to become one, and we do not operate as a business associate to any covered entities. Therefore, these privacy and security requirements do not apply to us. However, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA or for aiding and abetting the violation of HIPAA. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states requiring security breach notification. These laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business, and any failure to comply could result in harm to our reputation and potential fines and penalties. 
In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Environmental, Health and Safety Laws
Our operations and those of our third-party manufacturers are subject to complex and increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Further, in the future, we may open manufacturing facilities that would likely be subject to environmental and health and safety authorities in the relevant jurisdictions. These authorities typically administer laws which regulate, among other matters, the emission of pollutants into the air (including the workplace), the discharge of pollutants into bodies of water, the storage, use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances, the exposure of persons to hazardous substances, and the general health, safety and welfare of employees and members of the public. Violations of these laws could subject us to strict liability, fines, or liability to third parties.
