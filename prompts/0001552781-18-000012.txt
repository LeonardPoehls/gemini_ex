Item 1. Business.
HISTORY OF OUR COMPANY
 
We were incorporated in Delaware on September 17, 2007 as 1 Lane Technologies Corporation. On February 27, 2009, our corporate name was changed to Adama Technologies Corporation to better reflect our business activities. We acquired the rights to a patent-pending technology upon which a unique wireless data platform is built. On October 27, 2008, we abandoned the business relating to the patented technology and executed an exclusive brownfield license agreement with Solucorp Industries Ltd., pursuant to which we acquired a 15-year license to certain environmental hazard remediation technology. Subsequently, we have acquired and thereafter abandoned several mining and mining related companies, but as of December 31, 2014, we became a shell company and have no operating activities. On September 10, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Acquisition with Incubator Holdings, Inc., a Wyoming corporation (the “Agreement”). Under the terms of that Agreement, Incubator Holdings formed an acquisition subsidiary, ADAC Acquisition Corp. in Florida; Incubator Holdings, Inc. (Wyoming) merged with that Florida subsidiary. This Agreement was later unwound by the board, however, the plan to continue with the reverse split of the common shares of the stock that was previously approved by the Board and Shareholders. This decision was submitted to the ADAC preferred shareholder and approved by vote of the preferred shares representing 51 percent of the total votes of all shareholders. ADAC, by Board resolutions and majority preferred shareholder vote, approved and reaffirmed this reverse action on November 1, 2016. On November 18, 2016 FINRA effectuated this reverse and stock was reverse 250 to 1. On November 23, 2016 Adama Technologies successfully completed its acquisition of Alpine Industries, a defense contractor that manufactures a number of parts for the United States government. This purchase and sale agreement was disclosed in an 8-K filed on December 13, 2016. With Alpine having substantial annual revenues, Adama Technologies underwent a reverse merger and ceased to be a shell company at that time.
 
Our principal executive offices are now located at 110 Director’s Row, Suite B Jackson, TN 38301. Our registered office in Delaware is located at 113 Barksdale Professional Center, Newark, DE 19711, and our registered agent is Delaware Intercorp. Our fiscal year end is December 31.
 
OUR CURRENT BUSINESS
 
During the past year our main business was derived from our reverse merger target, Alpine Industries, which is a defense contractor for divisions of the United States military. We derive most of our revenues from government contracts. Our contracts are principally with the Department of Defense and various military acquisition organizations. Alpine is in the process of continually expanding its base of operation. It looks to develop a broader range of activities to accomplish its objectives. To that end Alpine has focused on developing its commercial services division and has developed key relationships to facilitate that. Alpine has developed a key relationship with IPEX Corporation based out of Canada. Throughout the year we have serviced 11 Research and Development contracts with them and this trend looks to continue. It is the hope of the corporation that more production work will come from these contracts.

Additionally, Alpine has been doing production work for Ducworks, a diverse company offering aerospace products as well as high-end commercial construction products. These types of projects add diversity and showcase Alpine’s ability to develop and manage multiple types of products. Alpine looks to continue building this relationship.
 
Focusing on continuing its Aerospace division, Alpine continues to service its 16 existing contracts. With over $2.2 million in anticipated revenues, it represents a major part of the business to be completed. As a commitment to its aerospace division Alpine also continues to bid on contracts available. Alpine has currently bid on over 40 contracts that fit within the over 200 different types of products that Alpine can produce.
 
Alpine looks to continue its path to deliver record setting growth, and feels as if the newly developed commercial services along with the steady and growing government contracts will produce the results the Company is looking for.
 
Additionally, we are actively seeking merger and acquisition candidates.
 
In the process of seeking merger and acquisition partners Adama has been able to successfully engage in three additional transactions which are asset purchase opportunities.
 
Transaction #1: On April 29, 2017, Adama completed the asset purchase of SafeGuard PII in which Adama acquired the technology products within SafeGuard PII. Safeguard protects families and businesses from identity theft. This technology provides far more than the typical credit card protection. In fact, it supplies the “7” essential components of whole identity protection. These include:
 

1. | Whole identity monitoring-not just credit cards 
---+--------------------------------------------------------
2. | Cyber-crime protection—hackers, viruses, etc. 
3. | Credit-management and credit protection 
4. | Privacy-minimized junk mail, spam, etc. 
5. | Lost wallet protection 
6. | Whole identity recovery—restoration to pre-theft status
7. | Cyberhood watch—24/7 real-time alerts 

 
SafeGuard PII’s technology is an industry pioneer and top-tier Privacy Management Firm that provides compliance solutions to companies throughout the U.S. SafeGuard PII is also a provider of the most robust identity theft protection and restoration product in the marketplace. SafeGuard PII has become known not only for educating the corporate environment on data protection strategies and privacy law compliance, it is also known for its whole identity monitoring and restoration solutions.
 
Where many programs just focus on credit cards and bank accounts, our PII Defender program monitors internet black market sites, other internet trading sites where ID thieves buy and sell information, utility and phone records, public databases, criminal databases and DMV records, in addition to credit files for your personal information. No other service gives you this level of protection. Members also receive lost wallet recovery services, Cyber security membership, credit report review and correction services and fully managed expert recovery assistance, restoring your identity back to pre-theft status including prosecution of the identity thief and so much more.
 
The terms of the transaction with Safeguard were an asset purchase of the technology in software for $2,000,000, payable in restricted shares of stock. Additionally, the Company appointed the founder of Safeguard, Mr. Mark Brown, to an advisory position and named him the director of sales in order to help better market and sale the assets acquired.
 
Transaction #2: Subsequent to this filing period, Adama Technologies negotiated and completed an asset acquisition of several technology platforms called Prenr, Trove and Generation H.E.R.O. from Element 99, LLC. In this transaction, Adama Technologies acquired a 25% participation of these technologies and platforms within their own sales environments. This transaction is pending the Company becoming current in its financial reporting obligations with the SEC.
 
Element99 was founded in early 2016 as a startup focused on creating innovative solutions for entrepreneurs. During the last 20 months, Element99 has been in development of several product brands that will become the foundation for the upcoming entrepreneurial ecosystem. One of the driving motivators behind Element99 is to band together with organizations worldwide to help fight entrepreneurial burnout and depression. Generation H.E.R.O. was formed to help entrepreneurs reach out in times of failure and distress, a common enemy that every entrepreneur can relate with. Generation H.E.R.O. will begin by publishing unique content showcasing the journeys of several successful entrepreneurs through short films, podcasts, interviews, and social broadcasts. The mechanism to distribute awareness for Generation H.E.R.O. is the product PRENR, a lifestyle brand that provides education, services, and merchandise to support the overall identity of this subculture. 
 
Element99 has also been developing a social commerce platform called Trove, innovating around how people discover and share the things they use and enjoy every day. This social platform is an integrated marketplace that allows consumers to discover and share products with their

peers in a dedicated network focused on user experiences instead of friendship and status. Trove provides a social experience that cannot be found on any other platform and has created a vehicle to connect consumer and advertiser together in ways that can push commerce forward into the digital economy. 
 
The team behind Element99 has over 40 years combined marketing and product development experience and is growing rapidly as they enter the first phase of release in late 2017. The mission behind Element99 is to help entrepreneurs reach their goals through passion, creativity, and the relentless pursuit of innovation. This mission is driven and reiterated throughout the company by founder Chris Jones, and in his words, ”My passion is to build the greatest entrepreneurial brand in the world and my vision is to always believe we can build a brand that makes a difference.”
 
Transaction #3: Subsequent to this filing period, Adama Technologies negotiated the acquisition of EZ Mart Food Stores, Inc. This acquisition will include the assignment of two contracts to purchase convenience store operations in Cusseta, Alabama and Holiday, Florida. These operations are currently generating $10 million and $8 million in annualized revenue respectively. Both locations are set to close in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 
Employees The Company currently has 7 full time employees, 3 of those are salaried employees and 4 of those employees earn an hourly wage.
 
Facilities Our principal executive offices are now located at 110 Director’s Row, Suite B Jackson, TN 38301. Our registered office in Delaware is located at 113 Barksdale Professional Center, Newark, DE 19711, and our registered agent is Delaware Intercorp.
 
Alpine Industries leases a 11,700 square foot facility in Richmond, Utah that is utilized for manufacturing and operations.
