Item 1. Business
Background 
 
Ubiquity, Inc. (“Ubiquity” or the “Company”) provides a platform that enables users to connect to internet-based content on any type of device. Ubiquity’s unique technology and robust patent portfolio has led to the development of the Company’s signature product, the Sprocket. The Sprocket can be easily downloaded onto any type of device (such as mobile phone, tablet, laptop, smart TV, VR and AR devices, gaming consoles etc.) and then easily customized to provide the user with access to all web-based content, social media outlets, video-based content, private networks, social networks, personalized files, intelligent search, and virtually all other media. In short, the Sprocket provides easy and expedited access to content in the manner and choices selected by the user. The Sprocket also provides detailed analytics and data on the end-users, delivering tremendous value as a marketing tool to the content providers and advertisers.


Ubiquity expects new markets to be created and existing markets to be disrupted by Virtual Reality (“VR”) , Augmented Reality (“AR”) and Mixed Reality (“MR”) as used in the Sprocket platform. There are many examples of how (“VR”), (“AR”) and (“MR”) can reshape existing forms of entertainment and commerce - from buying a new home, interacting with a doctor, or watching a football game. As the technology advances, we believe that price points will decline, and an entire new marketplace of applications (both business and consumer) will enter the market. Ubiquity believes VR/AR has the potential to spawn a multibillion-dollar industry, and may possibly be as game changing as the advent of the PC. VR (which immerses the user in a virtual world) and AR (immerses the user which overlays digital information onto the physical world) is driving a trend towards the adoption of software and applications delivered via head-mounted-devices (HMDs) as a new computing form factor.
 
Ubiquity has adapted its platforms to include the advancement of Virtual, Augmented and Mixed reality. It has excited the public for decades, and is happening now due to the alignment of ecosystem drivers and technology advancements enabling the delivery of products and services via this medium. Currently, mobile technologies are accelerating the adoption of products and services designed to stimulate our human senses with realistic feedback that is truly immersive and that allows intuitive interactions. We believe desktop, video, shopping, entertainment, travel, education and training, fitness, and healthcare applications can be materially enhanced by Virtual, (VR) Augmented (AR) and Mixed reality (MR). Ubiquity aims to capitalize on the evolving use cases, the potential market disruption, and the challenge of moving from science fiction to widespread adoption.
 
Virtual, Augmented and Mixed reality is essentially an artificial, software-created environment presented to users in such an immersive way that it is accepted by the user as real. By stimulating the senses of sight and sound –and sometimes touch– we can interact with these environments in much the same way as we would the real world.
 
Immersion enhances everyday experiences, making them more realistic, engaging, and satisfying. VR, AR and MR provide the ultimate level of immersion, creating a sense of physical presence in real or imagined worlds. They bring a new paradigm for how we can interact with the world, offering unprecedented experiences and unlimited possibilities that will enhance our lives in many ways.

On December 31, 2014, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Sponsor Me, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Sponsor Me”). Sponsor Me is a related party as Brenden Garrison was the CEO of Sponsor Me and is also the CFO of the Company. The Effective Date of the transaction was March 31, 2015 and resulted in the acquisition of Sponsor Me. Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, Ubiquity acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Sponsor Me from the Sponsor Me shareholders for an aggregate of 3,878,467 shares, or 3.59% of the Company’s common stock at that time, and Sponsor Me became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
In addition, in connection with the transaction, the Company forgave notes/accounts receivables due from Sponsor Me and SC Business, Inc., and members of SME management and SME consultants, who are also members of Ubiquity management, forgave approximately $3.2M in accrued salary and related expenses, Christopher Carmichael forgave $1,470,863, Connie Jordan forgave $1,198,565, and Brenden Garrison forgave $257,026 and the Company was relieved of paying payroll liabilities accrued in the amount of $313,136. On the closing date the management of SME relinquished all shares held as follows: Christopher Carmichael cancelled 19,800,000 in Sponsor Me, Inc. Connie Jordan cancelled 19,800,000 shares in Sponsor Me, Inc. and Brenden Garrison cancelled 25,000 shares in Sponsor Me, Inc., owning an aggregate 39,625,000 shares in Sponsor Me, Inc. and did not receive any additional shares in Ubiquity, Inc. or any other compensation in Ubiquity, Inc. as part of the Share Exchange Agreement. The Company recorded the acquisition of the remaining non-controlling interest as an equity transaction in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810.
 
SC Business, Inc. (“SC”) is an entity owned by the Company’s CFO, Brenden Garrison. At times SC, in order to assist the Company in accessing its credit card lines (as provided by the Carmichael family – see “Loans Payable – Related Parties” below), periodically charged the Company’s credit cards and remitted the related funds, net of fees, back to Ubiquity or to SME.
 
Remittances to SME are intercompany transactions. Accordingly, such amounts are eliminated in the consolidation of SME.
 
Video Search (MOFF)
 
The Company’s Match Orientation Field Filter (“MOFF”) software platform specializes in detecting objects and logos that have few artifacts enabling it to perform at a higher degree of efficiency and accuracy than its competition in both live transmissions and video environments. The software utilizes a methodology of detecting geometry over intensity which provides an advantage to our solutions over other products currently in the market.
 
The Company’s object and logo detection software platform provides a semantic understanding by combining edge detection and object tracking to recognize objects and activity within a scene. This allows for the detection of logos, locations and consumer products which can then be linked to offers and advertisements. This process can be executed on existing film libraries and/or on new content assets and can be applied to feature films, television programs, and user generated content.
 
MOFF for intelligent sports television is based on an interactive engagement platform providing the viewer the ability to interact with the programming on a real time basis. Our video intelligence provides the technology to generate information based on a robust proprietary object and logo detection platform.
 
MOFF video intelligence with object recognition technology, combined with our object tracking methodology offers the ability to detect numbers and names on sport jerseys, helmets, cars, etc. in sports broadcasts. By integrating this technology with existing search and voice recognition technologies, our product can highlight and track a given player in a sports broadcast. As an example, a viewer can instruct the television set to “highlight the running back” in a football game or track the statistics of a certain player.


MOFF also allows for the detection of objects such as guns, tattoos, license plates, and other artifacts that may be of interest in a security, military or law enforcement environment.
 
In our system we employ effective depth map processing techniques, along with edge detection, components detection and filtering approaches, in order to design a complete image-processing algorithm for efficient object detection of multiple individual objects in a single scene, even in complex scenes with many objects or video noise. The Company is currently offering this technology for licensing to enterprise and government customers.

The Restructuring Plan
 
In addition, the Company is currently indebted in the amount of approximately $3.1 million to certain hedge funds and other investors holding convertible debt securities and warrants of the Company. Substantially all of these obligations are currently in default, either by reason of non-payment or alleged breaches of covenants contained in the various investment agreements.
 
Since 2015, the Company has been named as a defendant in 16 lawsuits filed by various third parties, primarily consisting of holders of its debt securities, alleging damages in excess of $3.0 million. In addition, due in part to its prior lack of funds to defend certain all claims, in some cases, default judgments aggregating approximately $8.0 million were entered against the Company. The Company has recently retained or is in the process of retaining litigation counsel for all such matters to the extent they are not resolved in the near future. Litigation counsel is in the process of evaluating the Company’s positions in such matters, including the possibility of seeking to vacate the default judgments.


Although the Company believes that under its proposed Restructuring Plan set forth below (the “Restructuring Plan”), most, if not all, of the litigation relating to investors who provided debt or equity financing to the Company can be settled on commercially reasonable terms, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to settle any of such claims or vacate any default judgments.
 
As indicated in our March 24, 2017 Form 8-K, Ubiquity was unable to file its Annual Reports on Form 10-K as of, and for the annual periods ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016 or the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q required under the Exchange Act during 2016, for several reasons including its inability to obtain requisite financial information from a Non-U.S. entity. We recently were able to obtain such financial information and have commenced all procedures necessary to enable us to prepare such financial statements, including our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and enable our auditors to audit our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and review such unaudited interim consolidated financial statements.
 
The Company intends to undertake a Restructuring Plan described in order to (a) ultimately achieve compliance with its reporting obligation under the Exchange Act, (b) settle all, if not substantially all, of its outstanding litigation, and (c) implement its business plan to commercialize its patent portfolio and provide software as a service (SaaS) , mobility as a service (MaaS), virtual and augmented reality products and services.
 
Our Restructuring Plan consists of the following actions to be taken by the Company:


Compliance with Exchange Act Reporting Requirements.
 
The Company is currently working with its securities counsel and its independent auditors, to complete and file with the SEC on or before June 30, 2017 or as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, its past due periodic SEC required filings.
 
In the event that the Company’s registration under Section 12 of the Exchange Act is revoked, or if the Company ultimately elects to voluntarily delist its securities under the Exchange Act, the Company will nevertheless undertake to complete its audited and unaudited financial statements for the past due fiscal years and interim periods. The Company will then seek to relist its securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, by filing a registration statement under either the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act.
 
However, if the Company’s registration under Section 12 of the Exchange Act is revoked, or if the Company ultimately elects to voluntarily delist its securities under the Exchange Act, even if we comply with our commitments set forth above and in our Restructuring Plan, there can be no assurance that the Company’s will ever be able to relist its securities for trading under Section 12 of the Exchange Act.

Equity Financing
 
Under our proposed Restructuring Plan, the Company will undertake to obtain commitments from strategic investors for a private placement equity financing of between $5.0 million and $10.0 million. In such connection, the management of the Company has sent proposed subscription documents to prospective investors, under which such investors would subscribe to purchase Common Stock at $0.25 per share (subject to certain “make-whole” share adjustments provided therein). All funds provided with subscriptions would be placed into a special escrow account acceptable to such investors, and shall be released to the Company only upon consummation of the Restructuring Plan described herein, including the filing of all SEC Reports and (if applicable) relisting of the Company’s securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. In addition, such subscription agreement provides that each subscribing investor will have the option, exercisable within ten days of receipt of either (a) the Company’s 2016 Form 10-K Annual Report and the Form 10-Q Quarterly Report for the three months ended March 31, 2017, or (b) a registration statement covering Company securities declared effective by the SEC, to rescind his or its investment in the Company’s securities.
 
There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain subscriptions for the contemplated minimum $5,000,000 of equity financing on the above contemplated terms, if at all.
 
Settlements with Creditors.
 
Subject to establishment of an escrow account with a minimum of $5,000,000, the Company will then seek to negotiate settlements with its creditors which would include payment or restructuring of the terms of convertible notes currently in default. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to effect such settlements on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all.
Stockholders Meeting.
 
At such time as the Company has completed its audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016 and its unaudited interim financial statements, the Company will call a stockholders meeting to (a) elect board of directors, which will include, in addition to the current board members, three independent directors; and (b) ratify prior transactions, including the Restructuring Plan. In any event, whether or not the Restructuring Plan has been accomplished, the Company will nonetheless hold its annual stockholders meeting on or about September 5, 2017, or as soon thereafter as is practicable.
 
There can be no assurance that all or any material portion of the Company’s proposed Restructuring Plan will be accomplished on or about June 30, 2017, if at all. The failure to achieve all or substantially all of the provisions of such Restructuring Plan would have a material and adverse effect on the Company and put its ability to continue its business operations into substantial doubt; as a result of which, current investors in the Company could lose their entire investment


Other Arrangements
 
Ubiquity entered into a Mandate agreement with Strategic Capital Management, Ltd., (“SCM”) on February 3, 2016 (the “SCM Agreement”).  The SCM Agreement provided, in part, for the following:
 
●        SCM agreed to acquire certain Convertible Notes in the approximate outstanding balance of $3.5 Million and the notes were to be retired without conversion. 
 
●        Manage the commercialization of the Company’s Sprocket products and technology through Sprocket HK Limited and iWebGate dba Netlinkz (ASX:NET) and establish new royalty agreements in order that any revenue generated through the commercialization can be provided to Ubiquity under a royalty percentage.
 
●        Among other things SCM was to provide capital raising, debt restructuring, and specific corporate advisory services leading to the commercialization of the Company’s products and services offerings.


In connection with the SCM Agreement, SCM entered in to agreements to purchase convertible promissory notes issued to Ubiquity, Inc. from Vista Capital, First Fire Global ,Blue Citi, JDF Capital and Call and Jensen. In connection with these purchases, SCM made small payments against the notes. These purchase agreements did not release the Company from its obligations under the notes, and the assignments of such notes to SCM was not effective until full payment of the note by SCM.  Unfortunately, SCM did not complete its purchase of such promissory notes, defaulting on their agreements, and as a result Ubiquity was sued by certain noteholders for performance of its obligations to certain convertible note holders. Vista Capital and Firstfire Global sued the Company for the balance of the note for non-payment (see legal section).
