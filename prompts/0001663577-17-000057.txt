Item 1. Business 
Company Overview
 
We are in the business of purchasing and selling colored diamonds and other valuables.
 
On August 10, 2015, we purchased our first set of colored diamonds from Kashif Khan, our officer and director, with a wholesale value of US$4 Million, in exchange for issuing to him three secured demand convertible promissory notes totaling US$4 Million. On July 15, 2016, however, Khan demanded payment on his convertible notes. Because we had not raised $5 million in debt or equity financing and no portion of the notes had been converted, we elected to return the diamonds to Khan in lieu of payment, as provided for in the notes.
 
Since our initial purchase of diamonds, we have continued to acquire colored diamonds to build our inventory. At year end, we issued 4,880,215 shares of common stock related to various Diamond Purchase Agreements for colored diamonds with a liquidation value of approximately $1.3 million.
 We plan to manage a portfolio of rare colored diamonds that are selected for price potential. Our officer and director, Kashif Khan, has established a worldwide reputation as a purveyor of exquisite, extraordinary fine quality colored diamonds that are sold at competitively reasonable prices. Through Mr. Khan’s reputation and long standing close business ties to the diamond wholesale market, we plan to have direct access to acquiring an unsurpassed collection of the highest investment grade colored diamonds that are released on a wholesale basis to auction houses, investors and jewelry wholesalers and retailers throughout Toronto and Vancouver, Canada. We also intend to move our business into the United States, and thereafter internationally as funds permit and if our growth sustains the effort.
 On April 25, 2016, we signed an Acquisition of Shares Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Karrah Inc., an Ontario corporation (“Karrah”), and the sole shareholder of Karrah, Farrah Khan (“Khan”). Khan is the wife of our director, Kashif Khan. Pursuant to the Agreement, we agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock in Karrah, resulting in a parent subsidiary relationship. In consideration for the acquisition of Karrah, we agreed to issue to Khan a three year promissory note (the “Note”) in the amount of $1,500,000, with interest at 6% per annum and secured by the assets of Karrah.
 In addition, we agreed to assume 100% of all account receivables currently outstanding by Karrah as of the date of the Agreement. In exchange for the outstanding receivable, we issued to Khan a three year promissory note (the “AR Note”) in the amount of $293,275.67, with interest at 6% per annum, also secured by the assets of Karrah.
 
On October 26, 2016, however, we learned that it was not possible to obtain an audit of Karrah that we were required to file with the SEC in connection with the acquisition as a result of the nature of the company’s jewelry inventory. Because we were unable to obtain an audit of Karrah, on October 28, 2016, we have restructured the entire transaction by entering into a Termination and Restructure Agreement. First, we and Khan have mutually agreed to cancel the Agreement to acquire the issue and outstanding shares of stock in Karrah. Second, we agreed to purchase from Karrah its customer list in exchange for a revised promissory note (the “New Note”). The New Note will be in favor of Karrah (and not Khan), valued at $1,500,000 with interest at 6% per annum, and will not be secured by the assets of Karrah. The customer list has been invaluable in establishing our current colored diamond inventory. Third, we have acquired some of the inventory from Karrah, and the value of the New Note reflects that consideration as well. Finally, we will not be acquiring the accounts receivable of Karrah so the AR Note will be terminated.
 
On December 5, 2016, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Cornerstone United Capital, LLC (“Cornerstone”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we were to acquire from Cornerstone colored diamonds with a wholesale value of $105,000,000 (the “Assets”).
 In consideration for the Assets, we issued to Cornerstone and its nominees a total of 214,000,000 shares of our common stock. In addition, Kashif Khan, our prior officer and director, agreed to transfer his 16,000,000 shares of common stock as part of the Purchase Agreement in exchange for 9,457,931 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock.
 On December 21, 2016, however, we were informed that Cornerstone could not fulfill its obligations under the Purchase Agreement. As a result, Cornerstone and its nominees are required to return all shares issued under the Purchase Agreement.
 We intend to continue to search out and acquire colored diamonds to expand our inventory.
 
Our fiscal year end is July 31. Our principal offices are located at 3425 Laird, Unit 2, Mississauga, Ontario L5L 5R8. Our phone number is 416-919-9509.

Colored Diamonds
 
The allure of diamonds is, like gold, they are easily authenticated, eternal lasting and an excellent store of value and safe haven from inflation. Unlike gold or oil, diamonds have exhibited stable pricing and avoided the high price volatility and instability seen in other commodity based stores of value.
 
Colored diamonds are especially unique as they exist in almost every color, size and price range. Colored diamonds vary from the faintest shade of pastel pink, brown or yellow to the most deep or vivid shade of blue, green or orange.
 
Colored diamonds can vary in color saturation or strength from very faint to more vivid in color. A slight shift in color strength can make a color diamond significantly more expensive than its counterparts. Only one in every 10,000 diamonds possesses natural color and is referred to as a colored diamond. For this reason, colored diamonds are purchased almost exclusively for the intensity and distribution of the diamond’s color. The value of a colored diamond typically increases with the intensity of the most salient color within the diamond. The more intense the color, the rarer and more valuable the diamond will be.
 
After color grade, carat weight has the most impact on price for colored diamonds. When diamonds are mined, large gems are discovered much less frequently than small ones. This makes large diamonds much more valuable. Other factors also play into the value of colored diamonds, just as they do in white diamonds, such as clarity, cut, shape and certification.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our long-term investment strategy includes:
 
•  The creation of a world class portfolio of unique color diamonds with high appreciation value, based on factors including closure of major producing mines, world availability and cost per carat.
 
•  To establish the company as an international branded investment colored diamond and valuables merchant for the acquisitions of investment grade precious stones that are acquired from individuals, mines and estates and sold through private transactions to auction houses, investors and consumers interested in obtaining such precious stones. 
 
•  To identify additional business opportunities where access to capital, expert knowledge of rare and precious stones, and reputation are paramount to success.
 
•  To sell our valuables to wholesale or retail customers, including outfitted and enhanced merchandise with our colored diamonds.
 
Keys to Success
 
Some of the key factors that will help us expand our operations include:
 
•  Timely accessing capital and debt financing sufficient to support increasing short term and long term capital requirements and to expand opportunities and respond to new business opportunities.
 
•  Establishing proper risk and internal controls to assure that all inventory assets are assessed correctly, properly secured and safeguarded to assure and protect inventory.
 
•  Maintaining the highest business integrity such that all sellers and buyers can have comfort that they are being treated fairly and with the utmost of respect, that there is transparency, and that there is a consistency in practices across transactions.
 
•  Expanding our visibility and access to sellers of colored diamonds and other valuables such that we will be able to secure a sufficient volume of high worth merchandise to support the buyer base and business overhead.
 
•  Becoming more visible to diamond investors and speculators across Canada and the United States.
 
•  Developing a state of the art information system, inclusive of inventory database, historical purchase and sale prices, number of days in inventory by item and category, seller and buyer information and locations, demographics, product interests, etc. that will give us an added competitive advantage and improve our internal controls and information technology.
 
•  Implementing a public relations and marketing program that will introduce and reinforce our branding.

Acquisition of Inventory
 Most of our colored diamond inventory comes from local suppliers in the open market. The inventory that we directly maintain is based on projected sales and revenues of our merchandise but ultimately is at the discretion of Mr. Khan, and his experience in the industry. We do not rely on any principal suppliers and do not have any formal contracts with our suppliers. Our business dealing with suppliers are based solely on long-standing personal relationships between them and Mr. Khan. In the event that we are unable to conduct business on satisfactory terms with any of these suppliers, we believe that an extensive number of alternative sources will be available us and that our business can continue without disruption or adverse change in terms of pricing and availability.
Our Marketing Plan
 
We intend to focus our marketing initiatives to establish distribution partners such as retailers and other wholesalers. We intend to initially focus marketing efforts in Canada and then the U.S. and, upon encountering significant success in these markets, we intend to expand marketing internationally.
 Branding will play a critical role in our success. We intend to conduct a marketing and capabilities landscape assessment to understand consumer purchase behaviors and values, assess short and long term socio-cultural and market trends, and analyze the marketplace and competitive landscape. For instance, India and China are currently a hot spot for colored diamonds. We intend to seek out the best targets for our merchandise in terms of demand and market trends.
 We intend to develop a website and advertisements for print and online media, and sales materials for retail strategic partners. We intend to maintain a graphics library to be used on all touch points.
 We also intend to establish a presence on Google, Yelp, Bing, Yahoo and all other online search engines that are used to search for colored diamonds. We intend to engage in significant SEO marketing efforts to ensure that we have strong results upon natural searches related to colored diamonds and other valuables. We intend to utilize PPC advertising, display advertising, and article marketing. Our future website is expected to display a full catalogue of our merchandise, background information regarding colored diamonds, information about our management team, and contact information. We also intend to maintain a social media presence on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media websites to have an interactive presence.
 Our goal is to evolve the brand voice to embody quality, variety, and a strong market position. We are in an enviable position in this ‘space’ whereby we can position the company and develop its identity as a new colored diamond company that provides a direct bridge between independent sellers and auction houses, wholesalers and retailers.
 Sales and Distribution 
 Our colored diamonds are mostly sold to auction houses in Toronto and Vancouver, Canada. We intend to sell to auction houses in the United States as we grow the business.
 We sell our other merchandise directly to distributors, retailers and other wholesalers, who then in turn sell the merchandise to consumers through retail stores. Independent retailers that offer our merchandise are not under formal contracts and most sell competing products as well.
 Our Team
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, we had one full-time employee. We use the services of independent consultants and contractors from time to time when needed.
Competition
 The valuable gems industry is highly fragmented and competitive. We compete primarily against other specialty gem sellers as well as other wholesalers that sell such merchandise. On a larger scale, the precious gem category competes for customers’ share-of-wallet with other consumer sectors such as electronics, clothing and furniture, as well as travel and restaurants. This competition for consumers’ discretionary spending is particularly relevant to gift giving, but less so with regard to bridal jewelry (e.g. engagement, wedding, and anniversary). Our competitive strengths are as follows:
 •  Our officer and director, Kashif Khan, is highly skilled at purchasing diamonds and has longstanding relationships with wholesale sources for investment grade diamonds through his well-established trade connections. 
 •  Successful development and growth of branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise.
