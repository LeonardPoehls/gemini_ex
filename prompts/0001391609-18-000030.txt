ITEM 1 BUSINESS 
Overview
 
NuLife Sciences, Inc. ("NuLife," the "Company," "we," or "us.") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 15, 2013, at which time we acquired a business plan for an online marketplace and community and website from Mr. Derek Cahill. Following our formation, we issued 7,250,00 shares of our common, now 21,750,000 shares following the 3:1 forward stock split (the “Forward Split”), to our founder, Derek Cahill, as consideration for the purchase of a business plan along with a developed website, www.anytimeJobs.com (the “Website”). The acquisition of the business plan and website was valued at $72,500. The cost incurred by Mr. Cahill for the business plan as well as related professional services was approximately $72,500 which is the value placed upon the shares issued to Mr. Cahill. As discussed below, the Website was taken down for reprograming due to security issues which resulted in cyber-attacks during the roll-out phase.
 
On October 3, 2016, Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire all of the assets (the “Asset Purchase”) of GandTex, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“GandTex”). GandTex is a biomedical company focused on advancing human organ transplant technology and medical research. The assets consist of certain proprietary patents for eliminating the need for an organ or tissue match, and the necessity for anti-rejection drugs, as well as management of, and historical data for, animal trials (“Animal Trials”) conducted by GandTex (collectively, the “GandTex Assets”). Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase, and upon achieving certain pro-forma goals, the Company agreed to provide additional funding for the continuation of the AnimalTrials in the aggregate amount of $300,000. In exchange for the GandTex Assets, the Company agreed to issue to GandTex 10,000,000 shares of its Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. The Asset Purchase was approved by a majority of the Company’s disinterested directors. GandTex was owned and controlled by a single individual Managing Member who beneficially owns 70% of GandTex at the time of the Asset Purchase, but is currently revoked in Texas, the state of its organization.
 
On December 30, 2016, the Company announced the completion of its due diligence with respect to the Asset Purchase to acquire all of the GandTex Assets on January 2017 the Company announced the Closing of the Asset Purchase.
 
As a result of the Asset Purchase, the Company redefined its business strategy to further fund, develop, gain regulatory approval for, and ultimately market the Nulife Process together with other applications and possible uses or derived from the GandTex Assets, or discovered by the Company while in the process of continuing the initial stages of the Animal Trials.

At September 30, 2017 the Company had one business segment: the resumption and development of the GandTex Assets, particularly the transplantation surgeries, in an attempt to obtain regulatory approval of the Nulife Process and related applications through various affiliated medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories and other third parties, such as CROs (collectively referred to herein as “Third-Party Contractors”), which were engaged to conduct our preclinical and clinical studies of the NuLife Process. The Company’s redesign of the Website, an online marketplace and community platform, which represented our original business commenced in fiscal 2014, is under suspended development pending the results of the evaluation of the Animal Trials, and the investigation of related applications of the NuLife Process through various affiliated medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories and other third parties, such as CROs (collectively referred to herein as “Third-Party Contractors”), which were engaged to conduct our preclinical and clinical studies of the NuLife Process.
 
Due principally to delays resulting from (a) the protracted negotiations with the Third-Party Contractors as to the consulting agreements, leases of facilities, and approval of our operational protocol, we did not recommence the Animal Trials until August 2017, and (b) shortly thereafter, being forced to suspend the Animal Studies due to the hurricanes that moved through southern Florida during late 3rd and early 4th fiscal quarters of 2017, which effectively shut down non-emergency business operations and certain Medical Facility operations such as ours until we could resume operations during and the 1st quarter of fiscal 2017-18.
 
In March 2017, we learned that Mr. James Gandy did not have the authority to transfer a component of the GandTex Assets from Duplitrans, Inc. ("Duplitrans"), to GandTex prior to closing on the Asset Purchase, and that Duplitrans was the actual owner of a license to one of the GandTex Assets. Therefore, on July 27, 2017 Duplitrans and GandTex entered into various agreements, some of which we were parties to, including a Royalty Agreement, Indemnity Agreement, Settlement Agreement, and Lock-Up Agreement, and an Addendum to the Asset Purchase Agreement between the Company and GandTex (collectively, the “GandTex Restructuring Agreements”). The purpose of these GandTex Restructuring Agreements was to effect the transfer of the benefit of the Asset Purchase Agreement from GandTex to Duplitrans, with additional royalty benefits to Duplitrans, and to authenticate the Assignment from GandTex to us of the Exclusive License Agreement which Duplitrans alleged was wrongfully cancelled by Mr. James Gandy , or transferred from Duplitrans to GandTex by Mr. James Gandy, for the sole purpose of GandTex meeting one of its commitments in the Asset Purchase Agreement, without proper authority. After the proposed transaction was approved by the Duplitrans shareholders, we restructured the transaction by way of the GandTex Restructuring Agreements so that we ended up with exclusive use and ownership of the intellectual property that was in dispute, but at the same time the Duplitrans shareholders were compensated for the license termination by way of an amendment to the conversion terms of the Series B Preferred Stock and a Royalty Agreement in favor of Duplitrans (the “GandTex Restructuring”).
 
Following our initial stage of the resumption of the Animal Trials conducted earlier in Ecuador by Duplitrans and GandTex, we learned that certain critical information concerning the organ transplantation process, thought to be contained in the GandTex Assets, was not contained in any of the Patents or License comprising the GandTex Assets, and was withheld by the inventor, Mr. Gandy during his review of our Protocol for the transplantation procedures (the “Omitted Transplantation Information”). In October 2017, as described in our Form 8-K filed October 21, 2017 following the discovery of the Omitted Transplantation Information, we entered into a settlement agreements with Duplitrans and GandTex pursuant to which we reversed the Asset Acquisition and the GandTex Restructuring Agreements in their entirety, and GandTex and Duplitrans agreed to the full return of the 10,000,000 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock, the cancellation of the Royalty Agreement with Duplitrans/GandTex, and a full release by GandTex and Duplitrans from any and all claims that they may have believed they had against us (the “Release”). In consideration for the termination of the Asset Purchase Agreement and the GandTex Restructuring Agreements, the Release and the return of our Series B Preferred Stock, we issued 2,000,000 shares of our common Stock to Duplitrans and to Duplitrans legal counsel.
 
In conjunction with Mr. Gandy’s final disclosure of the Omitted Transplantation Information and the Settlement Agreement, the Company agreed to assign all of the GandTex patents back to Gandex and the Exclusive License to Duplitrans. The transfer of the of the Exclusive License Agreement to Duplitrans together with the Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”)with NuGenesis, an entity in formation organized by certain of the Duplitrans shareholders(“NuGenesis”), should enable us to continue to pursue the organ transplantation activities already underway at our facilities in Florida. We must enter into an agreement with Duplitrans in the future to create a shared interest in the application of the Exclusive License for the joint development of NuGenesis' business model.

In October 2017, following the suspension of the Animal Studies, we began investigating a secondary application of the NuLife Process – known as “Wound Care” applications. To date, the proposed Wound Care activities (the “Wound Care Technique”) is still in the investigation stage, without significant expenditures by the Company due to our efforts to maintain adequate funding for our corporate operations. The Company has not had any direct participation in any of the Wound Care procedures which were conducted in Ecuador by James Gandy and others associated with GandTex or Duplitrans, with the view of pursuing a joint venture with certain parties affiliated with Duplitrans to exploit the NuLife Process as to the Wound Care Technique in the biomedical space. In late September and early October of 2017, we conducted a preliminary investigation of the Wound Care Process which had been conducted by third parties in Ecuador in February and March of 2017. As of the date of this report we are waiting for NuGenesis to complete the transfer of the patent rights to the NuLife Process from Duplitrans to NuGenesis, and for NuGenesis to complete the funding necessary to proceed forward with the assumption of certain of our obligations related to our Florida facilities and working relationships with the physicians performing the surgeries and Dr. Youxue Wang. The commercial relationship between the NuGenesis and Duplitrans have not been established in an adequate joint venture agreement, but only through the MOU during this exploratory stage of the business.
 
NuLife Process and Developing the Patented NuLife Process for Kidney Transplantation
 
The procedure itself, in its simplified format, follows six (6) steps: First the organ is removed, or the donor organ is examined. Then the Organ is put through a decellularization processes to isolate the extracellular matrix (ECM) of a tissue from its inhabiting cells, leaving an ECM scaffold of the original tissue. Specific cells are then harvested from bone marrow of the intended recipient. Following the bone marrow harvest the Particular hematopoietic cells are used in the process as well as a novel procedure involving temperature and pressure factors. As a result of the vacuum process, specific cells are released from platelets without complete platelet degranulation. The negative pressure created by the vacuum pulls the growth factors out of the platelets and into the plasma. Once processed, the cells are reintroduced into the recipient influencing further growth of an already implanted and recellularized organ which is an exact tissue match with a high probability of not being rejected without anti-rejection drugs.
 
Beginning over 3 years ago Pilot Studies were conducted: initially the 1st surgery was conducted in Ecuador, with 3 additional animal surgeries, one in the United States. Each study involved 2-3 animals per surgery, and all but one – unknown to the study group and the surgeons involved - had a virus prior to the transplant surgery, and did not pass the post-operative examination. As mentioned above, our initial US efforts to launch the Animal Trials utilizing the NuLife Process met with severe obstacles, the most important of which were the delays associated with negotiating agreements with and developing a protocol which were acceptable to the universities where we intended to resume the Animal Trials, and once we finally began our Animal Trials, we suffered another setback as a result of the severe weather - which shut-down our transplantation early and put us in a “suspension”, or holding pattern. Notwithstanding the severe weather problems and other factors causing the delays in starting the Animal Trials, we elected to suspend the transplantation activities.
 
The NuLife Wound Care Technique.
 
NuLife Biomed was actively assessing the Wound Care opportunity in Ecuador and Latin America. World-wide between 2% and 6% of the population suffer from wounds. Of those, approximately 15% experience wounds that are resistant to standard treatment. The largest segment are wounds associated with diabetic foot ulcers. The result of these wounds is significant impact on quality of life, risk of developing life-threatening complications, and increased costs of treatment.
 
The lyophilized Cytokine Concentrated Plasma (lyoCCP) product, which is the lyophilized output of the NuLife Process, is being studied for its potential use in accelerating the healing of these otherwise treatment-resistant wounds. During March and April of 2017, a small observational study was conducted in a clinic in Ecuador to assess the benefits of using the lyoCCP product in this setting. The results were promising, with all 8 subjects experiencing total or near-total closure to wounds that had been resistant to healing for months.

The Website: Online Platform
 
To date the Website segment of our business has not generated any revenue, however we have not abandoned the development of the Website, with certain modifications. Modifications are needed to ‘update’ the site to make it a competitive product related to the new entrants into the space since 2015. Companies like Yelp, TaskRabbit, and HomeAdvisor have extensive sales operations and marketing expenditure aimed at the reservation and culmination of market share. Growth in the area of consumer to direct home improvement services has led to the growth of an organic market of licensed and unlicensed contractors working to service extended demand resulting from the increase in market activity surrounding home improvement and commercial services (e.g. drywall, painting, fixture replacement, window washing, landscaping, car detailing etc.) Additional efforts are needed to safeguard against cyber-attack.
Competitive Conditions
 
NuLife Process
 
NuLife Organ Transplant Competitive Conditions
 
The current market in kidney transplant is primarily focused on optimally managing individuals who are awaiting transplants and, post-transplant, attempting to limit the threat of rejection. A number of companies and institutions are researching different methods to improve the current kidney transplant process including but not limited to: better methods to match donors and recipients, improve dialysis machines, grow replacement organs, use of stem cells, methods to treat the underlying kidney disease, and development of better anti-rejection medicines. The impact of any of these areas could potentially impact the importance of adoption of the NuLife Process.Further, as a result of our late start in the resumption of the Animal Trials together with the necessary restructuring of the Asset Acquisition and our currently limited financial resources, we could fall behind in the development of this transplantation process to the point that any number of companies could beat us to commercialization.
Online Platform and Community Competitive Conditions
 
There are many online and offline technologies similar to our Website’s current features, such as Craig's List, Angies List, Task Rabbit, HomeAdvisor, Kudzu, eBay Auctions, Penny Saver, and others; however, we do not believe there are any online websites that focus only on the service industry as an eCommerce / classifieds / auction marketplace. It appears that the Website may not be competitive in the “service” sector of the Internet space without certain modifications, but could have other applications which we may consider pursuing depending upon the results of the current Animal Trials, the investigation of the Wound Care Process and the results of our investigation of the opportunities in the oncology data management space. And, additional efforts are needed to safeguard the website against cyber-attack which was presented itself as an ongoing problem in initial launch and following prior phases of reprograming. .At the present time development of the Website is suspended. As funds are available, we may resume the modifications necessary to resolve the Websites security issues and resume the development of the Website.
Market Demand - Demographics 
 
Demographics - We believe the historical trend that sees the older population growing at a faster pace than the total population will continue well into the 21st Century. However, at the same time there are more and more competitors entering both segments of our current active and proposed business activities.
Intellectual Property
 
As previously noted, on January 19, 2017, the Company acquired certain proprietary patents and a related license in respect of a series of procedures and medical techniques focused on advancing human organ transplant technology which would eliminate the need for an organ or tissue match, and the necessity for anti-rejection drugs. Other than the aforementioned Website and the had no other patents or trademarks at September 30, 2017

Government Regulation and Industry Standards
 
NuLife Process- Organ Transplantation 
 
Government authorities do not permit us to commercialize, market, promote, or sell any NuLife Process in the United States without obtaining marketing approval from the FDA or in other countries without obtaining approvals from comparable foreign regulatory authorities, such as the EMA. Gaining approval to market a process such as ours, requires extensive preclinical development and clinical trials that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the process for the intended indication to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authority.
 
Once regulatory approval has been granted, the approved Nulife Process is subject to continual review by the FDA and/or non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Any regulatory approval that we receive for our NuLife Process may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing follow-up studies or surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product. In addition, if the FDA and/or non-U.S. regulatory authorities approve any of our NuLife Process, we will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements by the FDA and other regulatory authorities with regard to labeling, adverse event reporting, procedures, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and submission of safety and other post-market information. Facilities utilizing the Nulife Process would be required to comply with GMP regulations, which include requirements related to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control. We will also be required to report certain adverse reactions, if any, to the FDA and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our product
 
In addition to the above, and from time to time, regulatory requirements and policies change and additional government regulations are enacted. We, or our future collaboration partners, will be required to comply with such adjustments.
 
Online Market and Community Platform
 
There are an increasing number of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad pertaining to communications and commerce on the Internet. In addition, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals are under consideration by federal, state, local and foreign governments. Laws or regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet relating to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet, user privacy, taxation and the quality of products and services. Moreover, the application to the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as intellectual property ownership and infringement, pornography, obscenity, libel, gaming, employment and personal privacy is uncertain and developing. Any such legislation or regulation, or the application or interpretation of existing laws, may decrease the growth in the use of the Internet in general, prevent us from delivering our content in different parts of the world and increase our costs of selling products or otherwise operating our business.
 
Furthermore, sovereign nation legislation regulating online content could limit the growth and use of the Internet generally, and decrease the overwhelming acceptance of the Internet as an advertising and e-commerce medium.

Some privacy advocates and governmental bodies have suggested limiting or eliminating the use of cookies. In addition, the European Union and many countries within the EU have adopted privacy directives or laws that strictly regulate the collection and use of information regarding Internet users that is identifiable to particular individuals. Privacy legislation has been proposed in the US as well, and the US Federal Trade Commission has taken action against website operators that do not comply with state privacy policies. These and other governmental efforts may limit our ability to target advertising or collect and use information regarding the use of our websites. Fears relating to a lack of privacy could also result in a reduction in the number of our users and subscribers which could harm our business and financial results.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Pursuant to the closing of that certain Asset Purchase completed in January,2017we acquired certain proprietary patents and a related license in respect of the development of a series of procedures and medical techniques focused on advancing human organ transplant technology which would eliminate the need for an organ or tissue match, and the necessity for anti-rejection drugs, and identified it as the “NuLife Process”. The pursuit of the development of the organ transplant technologies acquired by way of the GandTex Asset Acquisition became our primary business activity during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. However, due principally to delays resulting from (a) the protracted negotiations with the Third-Party Contractors, particularly the South Broward Hospital District d/b/a Memorial Healthcare System (“Memorial”), the leases of facilities at NOVA Southeastern University (“NOVA”), and approval of our operational protocol, we did not begin the Animal Trials until August 2017, and (b) being forced to suspend such transplanting operations due to the hurricane damage to our transplantation facilities resulting from the hurricanes which moved through southern Florida during the Fall of 2017 effectively shutting down non-emergency business operations at FIU, with included certain medical facility operations such as ours. Asa result of the suspension of our Animal Trials, we began a more in-depth investigation of the Wound Care Technique. 
 
The Website Intellectual Property, which served as an online marketplace and community platform that was suspended due to the security problems that plagued the Website, but which represented our original business commenced in fiscal 2014, is still owned by us but is currently in a suspended development status due primarily to our recent allocation of financial resources to the NuLife Process. As funds are available, we may resume the modifications necessary to resolve the Website security issues and resume the development of the Website.
 
Employees 
 
As of September 30, 2017, we had four employees; Mr. John Hollister, serving as the Company’s CEO and President of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, NuLife BioMed Inc. (“NuLife BioMed”), Dr. Youxue Wang served as the Director of Research and who was the author of the NuLife BioMed protocol for the organ transplantation, Mr. Fred Luke who serves as our President, and Mr. Sean Clarke who serves as our Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and is our sole Director. Only Mr. Hollister, Mr. Luke and Dr. Wang worked for the Company on a full-time basis as at September 30, 2017. Mr. Clarke is serving on a contractual basis as he had other clients who demanded a portion of his time. Mr. Hollister subsequently resigned as CEO in December 2017. Refer to NOTE 14 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS in our Financial Statements.
 
We have used and will continue to use the services of various contract personnel from time-to-time in various positions within the Company and its subsidiaries. Although national unemployment rates remain high relative to historical averages, there exists a significant amount of competition for skilled personnel in the healthcare. Nevertheless, we expect to be able to attract and retain such additional employees as are necessary. Further, we expect to continue to use consultants, contract labor, attorneys and accountants as necessary.
