     ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
  Overview 
         We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company using our proprietary peptide chemistry platform to develop novel therapeutics for the treatment of serious diseases that are caused by excessive or uncontrolled activation of the complement system, a critical component of the immune system. Inappropriate activation of the complement system can quickly turn it from a beneficial defense system to an aggressor that plays a major role in immune and inflammatory diseases. We are developing our lead product candidate, RA101495, a convenient self-administered subcutaneous, or SC, injection, which is an injection into the tissue under the skin, for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH. PNH is a rare, chronic, life-threatening, blood disorder where red blood cells are mistakenly attacked and destroyed by the complement system. We expect to initiate our Phase 2 clinical program for RA101495 in PNH patients in the first quarter of 2017 and release data in the second half of 2017. We are also developing RA101495, administered SC, to treat other debilitating complement-mediated diseases such as refractory generalized myasthenia gravis, or rMG, and lupus nephritis, or LN. We expect to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial with RA101495 for rMG and a Phase 1b clinical trial supporting development in LN in the second half of 2017. 
         RA101495 is a potent synthetic macrocyclic peptide inhibitor of complement component 5, or C5. C5 plays a key role in the rupture and destruction of red blood cells, or hemolysis, associated with PNH. Inhibition of C5 is a clinically validated target for the control and suppression of complement-induced hemolysis in patients with PNH. Currently the only drug approved to treat PNH is eculizumab (Soliris), a humanized monoclonal antibody that acts as a C5 inhibitor and is administered biweekly by intravenous, or IV, infusion by healthcare professionals. Eculizumab had reported annual sales of $2.8 billion in 2016 for its two approved indications, PNH and aHUS. However, loss of hemolysis control, or breakthrough hemolysis, has been observed in patients treated with eculizumab, particularly towards the end of its two-week administration cycle. If approved for PNH, we believe RA101495, when self-administered SC on a more frequent basis, will provide sustained and improved disease control, which reduces the risk of breakthrough hemolysis, and offers PNH patients more convenience and flexibility compared with eculizumab. 
         The complement system, which consists of approximately 30 interacting proteins, offers a target-rich opportunity for us to leverage our Extreme Diversity platform technology that was pioneered by Nobel Laureate Dr. Jack Szostak and allows us to inhibit certain uncontrolled complement pathway factors involved in complement-mediated diseases. Our platform allows us to produce synthetic macrocyclic peptides that combine the diversity and specificity of antibodies with the pharmacological properties of small molecules. The highly specific and stable peptide-like molecules generated are much smaller than monoclonal antibodies and other biologics, enabling more convenient routes of administration while still offering the opportunity to target protein-protein interactions, a type of molecular interaction that historically has been difficult to address with other small molecules. We believe our technology will allow us to pursue challenging targets for which only monoclonal antibodies have been developed. 
         We are developing a portfolio of drug candidates designed to treat a variety of complement-mediated diseases, including rare blood, neurologic, ophthalmologic, renal and inflammatory diseases. We also have preclinical programs targeting selective inhibition of other complement factors for diseases with no approved therapies, including Factor D for ophthalmologic and renal diseases, an oral, small molecule C5 inhibitor and C1 inhibitor for certain autoimmune and central nervous system, or CNS, diseases. In addition to our focus on developing novel therapeutics to treat complement-mediated diseases, we have validated our Extreme Diversity platform by successfully identifying and delivering

    Our Strategy 
         Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company that transforms the lives of patients with serious complement-mediated diseases by combining our expertise in complement with our leadership in macrocyclic peptide technology. To achieve this goal, we are executing on the following strategy: 


 Advance our lead program, RA101495 SC, through clinical
development.  In our Phase 2 clinical program, we intend to establish clinical proof-of-concept by using convenient SC self-administration
in PNH patients. We plan to evaluate various hematologic parameters in PNH patients previously untreated with eculizumab, whom we refer to as naïve patients, patients currently treated
satisfactorily with eculizumab, whom we refer to as switch patients, and patients who have an inadequate response to eculizumab. Designed to be a SC self-administered product, we believe RA101495 will
provide improved control of hemolysis, reduce the risk of breakthrough hemolysis, and offer PNH patients greater convenience and flexibility. We expect to initiate our Phase 2 clinical program
in PNH patients in the first quarter of 2017 and to release data in the second half of 2017. 
 Efficiently advance clinical development of RA101495 for other serious
complement-mediated diseases, such as rMG and LN.  We intend to leverage our work in PNH, including the CMC and preclinical data packages, to
advance RA101495 for other complement-mediated diseases, initially including rMG and LN. There is strong mechanistic and clinical evidence for a beneficial effect of C5 inhibition in patients with
rMG, an autoimmune disease characterized by muscle weakness, and in LN, an autoimmune disease characterized by kidney inflammation and failure. We have established relationships with key opinion
leaders in both fields to design clinical development plans. We expect to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial with RA101495 for rMG and a Phase 1b clinical trial supporting development in
LN in the second half of 2017. 
 If approved, commercialize RA101495 globally either independently or by collaborating
selectively in certain geographies.  We have worldwide development and commercialization rights to RA101495. We intend to independently pursue the
approval and commercialization of RA101495 in PNH patients in the United States and Europe. Outside of the United States and Europe, we may pursue the approval and commercialization of RA101495 for
PNH patients either independently or in collaboration with others. We intend to develop and commercialize RA101495 for other indications independently or through collaborations with third parties. 
 Pursue clinical development of our pipeline programs targeting additional serious
complement-mediated diseases with limited treatment options.  In addition to developing RA101495 for PNH, rMG and LN, we are also leveraging our
structural knowledge of C5 to develop traditional, oral C5 inhibitors for follow on, next generation products to RA101495 and a broader spectrum of diseases of complement dysfunction such as diabetes,
autoimmune diseases and neurodegeneration. Other programs in our complement pipeline include Factor D administered by intravitreal injection, a clinically validated approach for dry AMD, Factor D
administered SC for orphan renal diseases, DDD and C3GN, and C1 inhibitors for certain autoimmune and CNS diseases. 
 Enhance our leadership position in the field of macrocyclic peptide technology through
continued development of our Extreme Diversity platform.  We have validated our Extreme Diversity platform by successfully identifying and
delivering orally-available cyclic peptides for a non-complement cardiovascular target with a large market opportunity in a collaboration with Merck. We intend to enhance our proprietary drug
discovery capabilities by expanding the chemical diversity of our peptide libraries to identify molecules with more favorable drug-like properties. We are also using our novel macrocyclic peptides to
guide the development of next-generation, orally-available small molecule drugs that bind to and inhibit targets in similar ways as the original peptides.

    The Complement System 
         The complement system is a critical component of the immune system. The immune system protects the body by recognizing and removing bacteria, viruses and other infectious agents, collectively referred to as pathogens. The complement system consists of approximately 30 interacting proteins that are produced primarily by the liver and circulate in the blood and through the body's tissues. Activation of the complement system leads to a series of enzyme reactions that produce factors that both directly kill pathogens and recruit immune cells to sites of infection. The complement system is activated in three distinct pathways, referred to as the classical pathway, the lectin pathway and the alternative pathway. Each pathway is activated by different triggers associated with the presence of an abnormal cell or pathogen. Irrespective of the activation event, these pathways converge on C5, triggering a series of enzyme reactions that leads to the formation of a pore in the target cell, which is known as the membrane attack complex, or MAC. In its physiological role, this is an extremely potent agent causing the rupture and destruction of bacterial cell walls. 
         Normally the complement system is tightly regulated to restrict activation to the site of infection and avoid injury to host tissues, or "self" cell surfaces. Under conditions of excessive or uncontrolled activation, the complement system plays a key role in a range of debilitating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In these conditions, the complement system causes damage:
 

 directly through the inappropriate formation of the MAC and destruction of healthy tissue or by the activation of detrimental pathways within
cells; 
 indirectly by signaling other elements of the immune system to attack healthy tissues; or 
 passively through deposition of complement factors in tissues. 

         The following figure depicts the key elements, proteins and factors within the complement system cascade. Many of these proteins are abbreviated with a "C" followed by a number. For example, C5 denotes complement component 5. Others are called "Factor" followed by a letter, such as Factor B. As depicted in Figure 1 below, irrespective of the activation event, these pathways converge on C5, triggering a series of enzyme reactions that lead to the cleavage of C5 into C5a and C5b. C5b then binds to C6, C7, C8 and C9 to form a MAC.

    Figure 1. Schematic diagram of the complement system cascade. 
 
  Our Approach 
         There are numerous potential therapeutic targets in the complement cascade, and inhibiting the cascade at different points may be beneficial to treat different conditions depending on the disease biology. Inhibition of C5 cleavage effectively blocks generation of C5a and MAC regardless of the specific pathway involved in complement activation. This approach of inhibiting C5 cleavage is most relevant to diseases with significant MAC deposition resulting in tissue injury, as is the case for PNH, rMG, and LN. In other conditions, the tissue injury is related to activation of a specific pathway of complement, such as kidney diseases like C3 glomerulopathies, in which tissue injury may be mediated by deposition of complement component C3 following uncontrolled activation of the alternative pathway. In this case, selective inhibition of the alternative pathway by targeting a key enzyme in the alternative pathway, Factor D, may block C3 deposition while preserving the capacity of the classical and lectin pathways of complement to continue to fight infection. The classical pathway is activated when an antibody binds to the surface of a pathogen, and recruits a complex of C1q, C1r, and C1s, and we believe that inhibition of C1 may be efficacious for treatment of certain autoimmune and CNS diseases. 
         Our pipeline of product candidates was discovered using our Extreme Diversity platform, a proprietary macrocyclic peptide chemistry technology pioneered by Nobel Laureate Dr. Jack Szostak. Our platform allows us to produce synthetic macrocyclic peptides that combine the diversity and specificity of antibodies with the pharmacological properties of small molecules. This platform allows us to generate highly specific and stable cyclic peptides that are much smaller than monoclonal antibodies and other biologics. Traditional peptides have been difficult to develop into drugs due to their susceptibility to degradation, limiting their circulating half-life, and lack of structural rigidity, limiting their potency and specificity. We have developed our Extreme Diversity platform to efficiently discover synthetic macrocyclic peptides that have greater structural rigidity and are less prone to degradation. 
 9

  We believe our synthetic macrocyclic peptides will be deliverable through more convenient routes of administration than monoclonal antibodies due to much greater bioavailability. 
         The complement system offers a number of particularly attractive targets where we can apply our platform technology to disrupt protein-protein interactions or produce highly specific enzyme inhibitors. We are initially developing a portfolio of drug candidates to treat a variety of complement-mediated diseases, including rare blood, neurologic, ophthalmologic, renal and inflammatory diseases. 
   Our Programs 
         Our lead product candidate, RA101495, is a potent synthetic macrocyclic peptide inhibitor of C5 formulated for daily SC administration that we are initially developing for the treatment of PNH. We expect to initiate our Phase 2 clinical program for RA101495 in PNH patients in the first quarter of 2017 and to release data in the second half of 2017. 
         In addition to developing RA101495 for PNH, we are also developing RA101495, administered SC, to treat other serious complement-mediated diseases such as rMG and LN. In the second half of 2017, we expect to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial with RA101495 for rMG and a Phase 1b clinical trial supporting development in LN. In addition to RA101495 and our collaboration with Merck, we have discovery and preclinical programs targeting selective inhibition of other complement factors, including Factor D administered by intravitreal injection for dry AMD, Factor D administered SC for DDD and C3GN, an oral, small molecule C5 inhibitor, and C1 inhibitors for certain autoimmune and CNS diseases. 
   RA101495 for Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria 
   Background 
         PNH is a rare, chronic, debilitating, acquired blood disorder that is most frequently diagnosed in early adulthood and usually continues throughout the life of the patient. Some of the prominent symptoms of PNH include severe anemia, a condition that results from having too few healthy red blood cells, severe abdominal pain, severe headaches, back pain, excessive weakness and fatigue. If not treated, PNH results in the death of approximately 35% of affected individuals within five years of diagnosis, and 50% of affected individuals within 10 years of diagnosis, primarily due to the formation of life-threatening blood clots inside the blood vessels, or thrombosis. We estimate that there are approximately 16,000 PNH patients worldwide. Eculizumab, the only drug currently approved to treat PNH, had reported worldwide sales of approximately $2.8 billion in 2016 for its two approved indications. A third-party study estimated that, as of 2015, the cost per year for treatment with eculizumab was approximately $543,000 in adults. 
         Certain PNH patients acquire a genetic mutation that prevents the normal attachment of complement regulatory proteins to the membranes of blood cells. On normal cells, these proteins are critical inhibitors of complement activity and provide one means of distinguishing host cells from invading pathogens. The absence of these proteins results in the accumulation of a complement protein called C3b, which leads to cleavage of C5 and the deposition of the MAC on essentially all blood cells, including red blood cells and platelets. Red blood cells are particularly susceptible to lysis by MAC, resulting in their destruction and release of hemoglobin, leading to anemia. Uncontrolled activation of complement on platelets can promote thrombosis which is the most common cause of death in PNH patients. Other serious and potentially life-threatening complications of PNH include high blood pressure in the lungs and damage to the kidneys. 
 10

    Current Therapies and Their Limitations 
         The only approved disease-modifying therapy is eculizumab, marketed under the name Soliris by Alexion Pharmaceuticals. Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds C5 and prevents its cleavage to C5a and C5b, thus blocking a key step in the complement activation pathway. Eculizumab prevents hemolysis, reduces the risk of thrombosis, and reduces the overall mortality rate in PNH patients to less than 3% over three years. Eculizumab is administered intravenously by healthcare professionals at biweekly intervals. Treatment duration is indefinite as the management of PNH requires ongoing chronic treatment. While eculizumab has demonstrated that inhibition of C5 cleavage results in improved clinical outcomes, breakthrough hemolysis has been observed to occur in a subset of patients in the last few days of each bi-monthly eculizumab treatment period. Such breakthrough hemolysis episodes are associated with worsening anemia and other symptoms of PNH. Furthermore, the recommended dosing regimen of eculizumab for PNH is 600 mg weekly for four weeks, followed by 900 mg on week five and 900 mg every two weeks thereafter. However, to address breakthrough hemolysis, a proportion of patients require higher off-label doses or more frequent dosing, leading to higher costs or further inconvenience. 
 Potential Benefits of Our Approach 
         RA101495 is a potent synthetic macrocyclic peptide inhibitor of C5, which is a clinically validated target for patients with PNH. We are developing RA101495 as a SC formulation packaged as a convenient, self-administered product that can be administered in a small daily, or less frequent, such as weekly, dose. We believe this approach will facilitate sustained hemolysis suppression, greatly reducing the possibility of breakthrough hemolysis. In addition, we believe self-administration will alleviate the significant time and cost burden associated with regular intravenous infusions by healthcare professionals, as well as reduce complications associated with IV infusions, including infections, thrombosis, and loss of venous access. 
         RA101495 is designed to bind C5 and block generation of C5a, C5b and MAC, potentially reducing hemolysis in humans to similar levels as eculizumab and allowing physicians to treat PNH with the same therapeutic rationale as the approved monoclonal antibody. Also, RA101495 binds to a site on C5 that is distinct from that of eculizumab, potentially conferring additional benefits, including the treatment of patients with R885H/C mutations, a population of PNH patients that does not respond to eculizumab. Importantly, RA101495 also blocks interaction of C5b with C6 and the formation of the MAC. For more information, see the figure in the section titled "The Complement System." We believe this feature of directly blocking MAC assembly would be a differentiating property of RA101495 that may be beneficial to patients in hypercoagulative and inflammatory states, such as infection, sepsis and trauma. 
         In addition, RA101495 is a synthetic product, and we expect that it can be produced at commercial scale at lower cost than biologics and monoclonal antibodies. As a synthetic, non-biologic product, RA101495 has essentially no risk for contamination by viruses and animal cell products. 
   Clinical Development 
         We have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of RA101495 in healthy volunteers in Australia. We expect to initiate our Phase 2 clinical program in PNH patients in the first quarter of 2017, and to release data in the second half of 2017. 
 Phase 1 Clinical Trial in Healthy Volunteers 
         We have completed a Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial of RA101495 in healthy volunteers to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, or PK (the activity of a drug after it enters the body of the patient), and pharmacodynamics, or PD (the effect of a drug 
 11

  on the target of interest and the patient), of RA101495 following single- and multiple-dose SC administration. In the Phase 1 trial, PK assessment focused on the concentration of drug in the plasma, and PD assessment focused on the suppression of hemolysis and complement activity. The results from this trial were presented at the European Hematology Association meeting on June 10, 2016. 
   Results from the Phase 1 Trial 
         In healthy volunteers, we observed the following in subjects treated with RA101495, as compared to placebo:
 

 highly predictable, dose dependent PK after single and multiple dose SC injections; 
 maintenance of robust ex vivo hemolysis suppression and complement inhibition with daily SC dosing; 
 near-complete suppression of ex vivo hemolysis and complement activity after a single SC dose; and 
 an acceptable safety and tolerability profile with no serious adverse events reported. 

 Single Ascending Dose 
         We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteer subjects to assess safety, tolerability, PK, and PD following a single administration of RA101495 at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 mg/kg. Twenty-two subjects were enrolled into four dose cohorts. Within each dose cohort, subjects were randomized to RA101495 or placebo. The trial design schematic is shown in Figure 2. 
         Since complement inhibition is recognized to increase the risk for infection with Neisseria meningitides, all subjects received ciprofloxacin prophylactically during the trial. Subjects in the highest dose cohort, cohort 4, also received vaccination against Neisseria meningitides. Blood samples were taken at pre-dose, and post-dose at 15 minutes, one hour, three hours, six hours, 12 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours in clinic and at each follow-up visit for PK and PD assessments. 
   Figure 2. Trial design of single-ascending dose cohorts in healthy volunteers. 
 



Pharmacokinetics 

         As shown in Figure 3, the maximum concentrations, or Cmax, of RA101495 achieved in subjects were highly consistent with the predicted values from a simulated model. We observed a linear 
 12

  relationship between the measured Cmax and dose, confirming dose-dependent exposure to the compound. The approximate terminal half-life across all subject cohorts was seven days, which we believe will allow for daily, or less frequent, dosing. 
   Figure 3. Pharmacokinetics of RA101495 following single SC administration in healthy volunteers. 
 
        Plasma concentrations of RA101495 were predicted by computer modeling, as shown in the left panel of Figure 3, and measured directly by Liquid ChromatographyHigh-Resolution Mass Spectrometry, or LC-HRMS, as shown in the right panel of Figure 3. 
 


Pharmacodynamics 

         After a single dose, we observed that RA101495 achieved rapid, dose-dependent inhibition of ex vivo hemolysis and complement activity in all subjects, as measured in the three assays shown in Figure 4. 
         We observed the maximum inhibitory effect of RA101495 on hemolysis and complement activity within three to six hours of dosing across all cohorts, and greater than 90% suppression of hemolysis was maintained over four days in some subjects who received a single dose of 0.4 mg/kg RA101495. 
   Figure 4. Evaluation of hemolysis and complement activity in plasma samples from healthy volunteers following a single administration of RA101495. 
 
13


        Red blood cells from healthy volunteers do not induce C5 activation due to protective factors normally expressed on their surface. To test the ability of RA101495 to suppress hemolysis, plasma from healthy volunteers was tested using two assays to evaluate hemolysis of antibody-sensitized sheep red blood cells, or sRBC. The first measured direct hemolysis of sRBCs in 1% plasma from subjects, as shown in the left panel of Figure 4. The second assay measured the concentration of plasma required to hemolyse 50% of the sRBCs in the assay, a value called CH50, as shown in the middle panel of Figure 4. The third assay measured complement activity by measuring MAC deposition when plasma samples were exposed to a surface known to activate the alternative pathway of complement, as shown in the right panel of Figure 4. 
 


Safety and Tolerability 

         In all dose groups, we observed that single SC doses of RA101495 were well tolerated in healthy volunteers. Injection site erythema, or ISE, was observed in three subjects at the highest dose and was mild (grade 1) with no pain, induration, tenderness or swelling and resolved spontaneously within two to five hours post-injection. No clinically significant changes were observed in vital signs, physical examination or clinical laboratory parameters, including hematology, blood chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis and ECGs. 
   Multiple Dose 
         In the second part of our randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, Phase 1 clinical trial, we assessed the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of RA101495 following daily administration at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg for seven days. Six subjects were enrolled and randomized to receive 0.2 mg/kg of RA101495 daily for seven days (four subjects), or placebo (two subjects), and were followed for four weeks to assess safety and collect PK and PD data. 
         As in the highest single ascending dose cohort, subjects receiving RA101495 received ciprofloxacin for seven days and were vaccinated to prevent Neisseria meningitides infection. Blood samples were taken at pre-dose, and post-dose at three hours and six hours on each dosing day and at each follow-up visit for PK and PD assessments. 



Pharmacokinetics 

         As shown in Figure 5, measured drug levels were consistent with predicted values from a PK model generated using data from non-human primate studies and single- and multi-dose data from the Phase 1 clinical trial. Plasma levels commenced with the PK model across all subjects, with minimal variability in exposure. At a dose of 0.2 mg/kg, RA101495 concentrations in plasma are expected to reach steady-state by day 11 (without a loading dose).

        Plasma concentrations of RA101495 were measured directly by LC-HRMS, as shown in the right panel of Figure 5. 
 


Pharmacodynamics 

         RA101495 exhibited rapid and sustained inhibition of both classical and alternative pathways of complement. We observed that inhibition of hemolysis was maintained at greater than or equal to 95% across the seven-day dosing period in all subjects and at greater than or equal to 97% at 24 hours after the last dose, as shown in the left panel of Figure 6. Hemolysis activity returned to pre-dose levels within two weeks following the last dose. Similarly, inhibition of alternative pathway complement activity as measured by MAC deposition was rapid and sustained at greater than or equal to 90% across the dosing period in all subjects. Complement activity returned to pre-dose levels within two weeks following the last dose.

15


        Complement activity was assessed by detecting destruction of antibody-sensitized sRBC by classical complement activity in 1% plasma samples from subjects, as shown in Figure 6. 
 


Safety and Tolerability 

         We observed that repeat dosing of RA101495 was well-tolerated in healthy volunteers. ISE was observed in three of six subjects. All three subjects were in the RA101495 dose group, and ISE was observed after one out of seven injections in two subjects, and after four out of seven injections in a third subject). All ISEs were mild (grade 1) with no pain, induration, tenderness or swelling and all resolved spontaneously within 23 hours post-dosing. No clinically significant changes were observed in vital signs, physical examination, or clinical laboratory parameters, including hematology, blood chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, and ECGs. 
   Planned Phase 2 Clinical Trial(s) 
         The global Phase 2 program is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of RA101495 in patients with PNH. We expect that the program will consist of two open-label Phase 2 trials, one conducted in the United States, and one conducted outside the United States. We expect that these trials will enroll three distinct populations of PNH patients based on their treatment history as follows. 


 eculizumab naïve patients, meaning patients who have never received eculizumab (Ex-US Protocol). 
 eculizumab switch patients, meaning patients who are currently treated with eculizumab (Ex-US Protocol). 
 eculizumab inadequate responders, meaning patients who are currently treated with eculizumab but have inadequate response. 

         Based on feedback we received from the FDA to date, we anticipate enrolling eight to 12 eculizumab naive patients, six to eight eculizumab switch patients, and six to eight eculizumab inadequate responders. Each patient will be dosed with a 0.3mg/kg loading dose of RA101495 followed by 0.1 mg/kg daily thereafter. After two weeks of treatment, and based on review of safety and efficacy data, patients will continue with 0.1 mg/kg daily or be up-titrated to 0.3 mg/kg daily if needed to achieve adequate control of hemolysis. Patients will be eligible for long-term extension following the completion of the initial 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint will be change in lactate dehydrogenase from baseline to the mean of six through 12 weeks. 
         We have received approval from the FDA and other ex-U.S. regulatory agencies to initiate our Phase 2 program. 
   Preclinical Studies 
         We have completed numerous preclinical studies with RA101495 in laboratory animals and in vitro experiments. RA101495 is designed to be a potent inhibitor of primate complement and a poor inhibitor in most other species, therefore in vivo evaluation of PK and PD was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. Data shown in Figure 7 demonstrate the strong correlation between plasma levels of drug and inhibition of complement activity in cynomolgus monkeys. These data show that plasma concentrations greater than or equal to 2.5 µg/ml are sufficient to inhibit greater than 90% of complement activity in cynomolgus monkey.

          Data in Figure 8 are representative of multiple studies conducted in cynomolgus monkeys, and show plasma levels of RA101495 and complement activity as measured by hemolysis of sRBCs following seven daily SC doses of 0.21 mg/kg and for 11 days following the last dose.

        We have evaluated the effects of RA101495 in a combination of efficacy and standard in vitro and in vivo toxicology assays to identify what we believe to be the appropriate first-in-human dose and dose-limiting toxicity for RA101495. 
   RA101495 for Refractory Generalized Myasthenia Gravis 
   Background 
         Myasthenia gravis, or MG, is a rare complement-mediated autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies targeting proteins that are critical for the normal transmission of electrical signals from nerves to muscles. Although the prognosis of MG is generally benign, in 10% to 15% of patients disease control either cannot be achieved with current therapies, or results in severe side effects of immunosuppressive therapy. This severe form of MG is known as rMG, and affects approximately 9,000 individuals in the United States 
         Patients present with muscle weakness that characteristically becomes more severe with repeated use, and recovers with rest. Muscle weakness can be localized to specific muscles, such as those responsible for eye movements, but often progresses to more diffuse muscle weakness. rMG may even become life-threatening when muscle weakness involves the diaphragm and the other chest wall muscles responsible for breathing. This is the most feared complication of rMG, known as myasthenic crisis, and requires hospitalization, intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Approximately 15% to 20% of patients experience a myasthenic crisis within two years of diagnosis. 
         The most common target of autoantibodies in rMG is the acetylcholine receptor, or AchR, located at the neuromuscular junction, the point at which a motor neuron transmits signals to a skeletal muscle fiber. Binding of anti-AchR autoantibodies to the muscle endplate results in activation of the classical complement cascade; deposition of MAC on the post-synaptic muscle fiber leads to local damage to the muscle membrane, and reduced responsiveness of the muscle to stimulation by the neuron. 
         Inhibition of terminal complement activity at the level of C5 or C6 has been demonstrated to prevent development of disease pathology in experimental animal models of rMG. Additionally, 
 17

  inhibition of C5 by eculizumab has been shown to improve clinical symptoms in patients with rMG. A recently-completed Phase 3 trial of eculizumab for patients with rMG showed a positive trend towards improvement in quality of life measures, although the primary endpoint did not reach statistical significance. 
   Current Therapies and Their Limitations 
         Current therapies focus on either boosting the AchR signal or suppressing the immune response, and none of these treatments targets the injury to the post-synaptic muscle endplate caused by complement attack. First-line therapy for mild symptomatic rMG is with inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, such as pyridostigmine bromide, marketed as Mestinon by Valeant Pharmaceuticals. If remission is not achieved with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, a course of systemic immunosuppressive therapy may be initiated. These agents have inconsistent evidence of efficacy, and all have long-term toxicities. They include corticosteroids, azathioprine, mycophenylate mofetil, and rituximab. Surgical removal of the thymus is sometimes performed in patients with moderate to severe rMG to try to switch off the production of autoantibodies. Intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange may be needed in patients with myasthenic crisis. 
 Potential Benefits of Our Approach 
         We believe that inhibiting terminal complement activity with our C5 inhibitor RA101495 may block complement-mediated damage to the motor endplate thereby preserving responsiveness to signaling and potentially preventing muscle weakness. 
 Clinical Development Plan 
         We plan to leverage our work in PNH to efficiently advance clinical development of RA101495 for rMG and intend to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of RA101495 in patients with rMG in the second half of 2017. 
 RA101495 for Lupus Nephritis 
   Background 
         Systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE, is a serious, potentially lethal autoimmune disorder characterized by multi-organ involvement and a chronic relapsing clinical course. LN refers to the specific involvement of the kidney that is seen in approximately 20% of SLE patients. It is estimated that approximately 63,000 individuals in the United States have LN. Although LN is a chronic disease, its course is characterized by intermittent periods of acute kidney inflammation and high disease activity, which are known as nephritic flares. The cumulative impact of these flares over time can cause irreversible damage to the kidneys. Although immunosuppressive therapy has improved prognosis for patients with LN, approximately 10% to 15% of these patients will develop end-stage renal disease, requiring a kidney transplant or initiation of dialysis. As such, LN is associated with an approximately six-fold increase in the rate of mortality compared with the general population. 
         The pathophysiology of LN involves the inappropriate production of autoantibodies which recognize self or "host" antigens, such as double-stranded DNA. The deposition of autoantibody-antigen complexes in the kidney activates the classical pathway of complement, resulting in generation of C5a, deposition of MAC, and subsequent tissue injury. Levels of the circulating complement components C3 and C4 are depleted in patients during LN flares, due to accelerated consumption of classical complement pathway proteins. Deposition of MAC has been observed in kidney biopsy samples from patients with LN. In a recent case report, MAC deposition, as measured by the presence of C9 in kidney tissue, was significantly reduced following treatment with eculizumab, and was 
 18

  accompanied by corresponding improvement in kidney function and clinical status. There have been several other case reports of improved kidney function in LN patients treated with eculizumab, suggesting that inhibition of C5 may be disease modifying. Additionally, inhibition of C5a activity has been shown to improve renal function and histopathological features associated with LN in animal models of the disease. 
   Current Treatments and Limitations 
         Treatment of LN flares varies according to disease severity and the type of lesions seen on kidney biopsy. Generally, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme are used to reduce proteinuria and hypertension, while corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, or azathioprine are used to suppress the immune system. These immunosuppressive treatments have significant toxicities associated with long-term use, and do not address complement-mediated tissue injury. 
 Potential Benefits of Our Approach 
         We believe that RA101495, by binding C5 and inhibiting generation of both C5a and MAC, may prevent progression of kidney disease in LN by blocking complement-mediated damage to kidney cells. By inhibiting renal injury, we believe that RA101495 may reduce dependence on steroids and other immunosuppresive agents, thereby potentially improving the long-term outcome for patients. 
 Clinical Development Plan 
         We plan to leverage our work in PNH to efficiently advance clinical development of RA101495 for LN and intend to initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial of RA101495 supporting development in LN in the second half of 2017. 
 Our Discovery Programs 
   Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration/Geographic Atrophy 
         AMD is the most common cause of blindness in older adults, and has an estimated worldwide prevalence of 8.7% among all individuals aged 45 to 85. AMD is subdivided into two forms based on the underlying pathophysiologic process. These are known as dry AMD and wet AMD. Dry AMD comprises 90% of all AMD cases, and is characterized by deterioration of the retina associated with the appearance of small deposits of debris, called drusen, under the macula. The remaining 10% of AMD cases are wet AMD , which is caused by abnormal growth of blood vessels in the retina. Whereas visual loss in patients with wet AMD occurs rapidly, within months to a year, dry AMD progresses much more slowly, over the course of decades. In dry AMD, patients experience progressive blurriness and blank spots in the center of their field of vision. It is estimated that approximately 1,000,000 individuals in the United States have GA. 
         The alternative pathway of the complement system is implicated in dry AMD by the presence of almost all alternative pathway complement components in drusen deposits. Moreover, specific variations in the genes encoding the alternative pathway complement regulatory proteins Factor H or Factor I, resulting in increased complement activity, are associated with increased risk of developing dry AMD. Variations in the genes encoding the alternative cascade proteins Factor B and C3 are also associated with risk for dry AMD. 
         Although several therapeutics targeting vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, to block growth of abnormal blood vessels are approved to treat wet AMD, such as Avastin, Lucentis and Eylea, there are no approved therapies for dry AMD or GA. Lampalizumab, an antibody to complement Factor D being developed by Roche, has demonstrated clinical activity for dry AMD. In Phase 2 clinical 
 19

  trials, lampalizumab reduced progression of GA in patients with a specific gene variant in complement Factor I. 
         We are developing inhibitors of complement Factor D for intravitreal administration, designed to prevent or reduce progression of GA in patients with dry AMD, thereby potentially preventing further vision loss and preserving sight. 
   C3 Glomerulonephritis/Dense Deposit Disease 
         C3GN and DDD are closely-related but distinct alternative pathway complement-mediated diseases characterized by C3 deposition in the kidney, with absent or minimal immunoglobulin deposition. The two diseases can be distinguished from each other by electron microscopy, based on the precise location and pattern of C3 deposits within the kidney. The combined prevalence of C3GN and DDD is 1-3 per million individuals, with an estimate of approximately 1,000 patients in the United States. The clinical features of C3GN and DDD include compromised renal function and high blood pressure. The pathophysiology of C3GN and DDD involves both genetic factors and acquired triggers. Patients typically present in adolescence or early adulthood, following an infectious episode which, in susceptible individuals results in uncontrolled activation of C3. Susceptibility to C3GN and DDD may be inherited on the basis of mutations in proteins that regulate the alternative pathway of complement activation. 
         There are no approved therapies for C3GN or DDD. Patients are usually treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers to modulate proteinuria, and with nonspecific immunosuppressants, including corticosteroids, when kidney inflammation is present. 
         We are developing specific inhibitors of Factor D, a critical component of the alternative pathway of complement, as targeted drug candidates for C3GN. By blocking the alternative pathway upstream of C3, we believe that this mechanism may prevent C3 deposition and subsequent renal injury. 
   Oral C5 Inhibitor 
         We are actively pursuing the identification of orally-bioavailable inhibitors of C5 that bind to and inhibit targets in similar ways as our peptides, but are traditional small molecules with the benefit of oral bioavailability. Leveraging our structural knowledge of C5 we have identified two series of molecules. Both series have demonstrated oral bioavailability in rat DMPK and low nanomolar potency has been observed in vitro in a red blood cell hemolysis assay. Furthermore, one of these series bind to a previously unrecognized site on C5, inhibiting cleavage and activation of C5. 
         These series are being further optimized by structural understanding of crystals obtained with full length C5 in stabilized tertiary co-complex. It is expected that this could yield a pipeline of orally available products for a broader set of systemic indications including metabolic diseases (e.g., diabetes). We have also identified early evidence of CNS penetration in one series, offering the possibility of treating complement dysfunction in complex CNS disorders such as neuroinflammatory (e.g., stroke, multiple sclerosis) and neurodegenerative disease (e.g., Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease). 
 Complement Component 1 (C1) 
         We are also engaged in discovery efforts to identify inhibitors of C1 with potential applications in a range of autoimmune and CNS diseases. C1s is involved in the classical complement pathway. A complex comprised of C1s, along with complement components 1q and 1r (C1r and C1q) bind to antigen-antibody complexes, and the serine protease domain of C1s cleaves C4 to generate C4b as an initial step in forming the classical pathway C5 convertase, C4bC2bC3b, where C4b, C2b, and C3b are domains of complement components 4, 2, and 3, respectively. In cases of inappropriate production of self-reactive antibodies in autoimmune disease, or production of anti-tissue antibodies in organ transplantation setting, C1s activity can lead to pathologic C5 activation, producing C5b9 (MAC) and the inflammatory mediator C5a. 
 20


        Thus, inappropriate C1 and classical complement convertase activity is linked to a variety of immune complex-mediated indications, including cold agglutinin disease, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, antibody-mediated rejection (such as with kidney transplant), Guillain-Barre Syndrome, neuromyelitis optica, rMG, multiple sclerosis, bullous pemphigoid (a rare and debilitating skin disease), and other diseases. Furthermore, inappropriate activity of the C1q-C1r-C1s complex and C4 levels has been implicated in a variety of neurologic conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, spinal muscular atrophy, frontal temporal dementia, glaucoma, and schizophrenia. We estimate that the incidence rates of these indications include approximately one in 80,000 people for cold agglutinin disease, approximately one in 100,000 people for warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and an aggregate of approximately 5.4 million total patients in the United States with Alzheimer's disease. Other neurodegenerative diseases include Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Guillain-Barre syndrome. 
         We have used our platform technology to generate cyclic peptides that bind C1s and inhibit the protease activity of C1s, C4b production, and red blood cell lysis in an in vitro assay. We are further working to identify cyclic peptides that bind to other protein domains and components of the C1q-C1r-C1s complex. 
         In addition to the programs described above, we also have discovery and preclinial programs targeting selective inhibition of various complement factors for other indications. For example, we are also a developing a Factor D inhibitor program designed to reduce C3 fragment coating on PNH red blood cells and subsequent spleen phagocytosis, which could potentially increase the risk of infection and limit investigator interest, but which we also believe has the potential to serve as an efficacious treatment method. 
   Our Extreme Diversity Platform 
         Known as our Extreme Diversity platform, our proprietary macrocyclic peptide chemistry technology allows us to produce synthetic macrocyclic peptides that combine the diversity and specificity of antibodies with the pharmacological properties of small molecules. 
         We utilize a process called "mRNA display" to produce extremely large and diverse libraries of peptides from which to screen for potential product candidates. Figure 9 illustrates the step-by-step process of mRNA display. 
 

 Step 1, creation of peptide-mRNA fusion
libraries.  mRNA is translated into peptides by ribosomes using both naturally occurring amino acids and non-natural amino acids. The antibiotic
puromycin is linked to each mRNA to create peptide-mRNA fusions. As a result, the translation of a relatively small amount of mRNA results in a large and diverse library of up to 100 trillion
peptide-mRNA fusions. 
 Step 2, creating rigid macrocycle
peptides.  The peptide-mRNA display libraries are then modified chemically to link two specific amino acids together and cyclize the peptide into
rigid macrocycle peptides. In addition, the mRNA components of the fusions are converted to cDNA (a hybrid of mRNA and DNA) at this step. 
 Step 3, selecting target
peptides.  Once a cyclic peptide mRNA display library is prepared we select peptides that bind to the desired target protein immobilized on the
surface of a small, solid bead. 
 Step 4, DNA amplification.  After
an initial set of peptides that bind to the target protein are selected, we leverage the mRNA to then amplify the peptides' corresponding DNA via a DNA amplifying technique called Polymerase Chain
Reaction, or PCR. 

 21

  

 Steps 5, 6 and 7, repeat process to select lead
candidate.  The cycle can be repeated to enrich for candidate peptides (Step 5), and the DNA's
sequence is ultimately determined and desired peptide candidates are synthesized based on the information in its corresponding DNA (Step 6), and
candidate peptides are then further screened and optimized for desired target binding affinity to select a lead candidate (Step 7). 

   Figure 9. A diagram illustrating our Extreme Diversity platform. 
 
        RA101495 and our pipeline of peptide product candidates were discovered using our Extreme Diversity platform, our proprietary technology that allows us to rapidly and efficiently discover cyclic peptides comprised of natural and non-natural amino acids, with the advantages set forth below. 
 

 High affinity and potency.  Our
peptides are cyclic, and therefore are conformationally rigid, thereby "locking" the molecule in the conformation in which it binds optimally to its target and leading to affinity and potency similar
to antibodies. 
 High specificity.  Our peptides
are larger than most drugs taken in pill form, allowing them to have more contact points when bound to their targets, thus affording similar specificity as antibodies. 
 Novel mechanisms of
interaction.  The use of non-natural amino acids with new chemical functionalities expands the manner in which peptides can interact with target
proteins, potentially enabling new mechanisms to modulate protein function in the body. 
 High stability.  The backbone
modification and relatively rigid, cyclic structure of our peptides are designed to reduce degradation. As a result, we believe our peptides will have higher stability in the body than natural
peptides. Further, they will not denature or unfold over time, and have higher stability than antibodies and biologics, potentially allowing for room temperature storage over the entire distribution
chain. 
 Improved bioavailability.  The
relatively small size of our peptides allows them to enter the circulation readily when administered by a variety of potential routes, including SC injection or 

 22

  

oral
administration, an advantage over many monoclonal antibody and biologic therapies which require intravenous infusion. 


 Half-life modification.  As
synthetic products, we can readily modify our cyclic peptides with chemical groups that modify the circulating half-life in the body, including lipids, carbohydrates, and polymers such as polyethylene
glycol, providing the potential to optimize dosing by fine-tuning the pharmacokinetic properties and improve patient outcomes. 
 Reduced safety risks.  Unlike
antibodies and biologics, our peptides are completely synthetic, eliminating the potential for viral and cellular protein contamination, risks to therapeutics produced in mammalian cells, and
potentially allowing for administration to patients with hypersensitivity to products produced using mammalian cells. 
 Favorable manufacturing processes and
costs.  As synthetic products, our peptides do not need complex fermentation facilities, allowing their production to be easily sourced from
multiple vendors at lower costs than mammalian cell products. 

         We are driving the development of the next generation of orally available drugs. Certain of our cyclic peptides are being developed into orally available drugs, as exemplified by our high value target developed in our collaboration with Merck. We can also use our platform to develop novel macrocycle peptides to guide the development of orally-available, traditional small molecule drugs such as our oral C5 inhibitors. 
         We protect our intellectual property rights related to the Extreme Diversity program through a combination of licensed patents, trade secrets and know-how. For more information, see the section titled "Intellectual Property." 
   Our Merck Collaboration and License Agreement 
         In April 2013, we entered into a multi-target collaboration and license agreement with Merck to use our proprietary drug discovery technology platform to identify orally available cyclic peptides for non-complement program targets nominated by Merck and provide specific research and development services. Under the agreement, we granted Merck licenses under certain of our intellectual property rights to manufacture, develop and commercialize compounds and products directed to selected program targets. The agreement consists of a research phase, where we and Merck collaborated on identifying and pre-clinically developing orally available cyclic peptides suitable for further development by Merck, and a development and commercialization phase pursuant to which Merck has sole discretion and responsibility, including financial responsibility, for further development and commercialization of these peptides, on a program-by-program basis, from the collaboration. In April 2015, the agreement was amended to extend the research term of the collaboration to April 2016. 
         At the signing of the agreement, Merck made an upfront non-refundable, technology license fee of $4.5 million to us. In addition, during the research term, which ended in April 2016, the agreement provided for reimbursement of research and development services provided by us in accordance with pre-specified limits for the number of our full-time equivalent employees ("FTEs") working under the agreement. At the conclusion of the research term, Merck elected to continue the development of a non-complement cardiovascular target with a large market opportunity, for which we had received $3.5 million in preclinical milestone payments as of June 2016. 
         We are entitled to receive future aggregate milestone payments of up to $61.5 million for the non-complement cardiovascular target selected, consisting of remaining preclinical and clinical milestones of $16.5 million, regulatory milestones of $19.0 million and commercial milestones of $26.0 million, and low-to-mid single digit percentage royalties on future sales, if any. Royalties will be payable from the first commercial sale in a country until the later of the last to expire valid claim in such country and a specified number of years from the date of such first commercial sale. The 
 23

  agreement expires on a country-by-country basis upon expiration of Merck's royalty obligations. Merck may terminate the agreement in its entirety upon prior written notice to us. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of bankruptcy of the other party or uncured material breach. We may terminate the agreement if Merck challenges any of our patent rights covered by the agreement. 
   Intellectual Property 
   Overview 
         We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including our Extreme Diversity platform. This includes seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how that may be important for the development of our business. This includes aspects of our proprietary technology platform; our continuing technological innovation; and on in-licensing opportunities used to develop, maintain, and strengthen our position in the field of peptide, peptidomimetic, and small molecule-based therapeutics. We additionally may rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available. 
         Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, defend and enforce our patents; prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. 
         Our ability to stop third parties from making, having made, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. In some cases, these rights may need to be enforced by third party licensors. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same. For more information, please see "Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property." 
         We seek to protect our proprietary position in a variety of ways, including by pursuing patent protection in certain jurisdictions where it is available. For example, we file U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel products. We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. We are a party to various other license agreements that give us rights to use specific technologies in our research and development. 
         The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application related to the patent. A U.S. patent also may be accorded a patent term adjustment, or PTA, under certain circumstances to compensate for delays in obtaining the patent caused by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In some instances, such a PTA may result in a U.S. patent term extending beyond 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application related to the U.S. patent. In addition, in the United States, the term of a U.S. patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the 
 24

  length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. 
   Company-Owned Intellectual Property 
         Our lead C5 inhibitor portfolio includes four families of United States patent applications directed to our lead C5 inhibitor and related methods of use. Any patents that may grant from these patent applications are generally expected to expire between 2035 and 2037, subject to possible patent term extensions. 
         We also own one United States patent and various patent applications directed to other technologies. The United States patent is expected to expire in 2034, and any patents granted on the pending applications are expected to expire between 2034 and 2037, subject to possible patent term extensions. 
   Licensed Intellectual Property 
         We have exclusively licensed one patent family directed to an in vitro translation system for incorporating unnatural amino acids from Dr. A. C. Forster. This family, which covers certain rights related to our Extreme Diversity platform, includes five granted patents, including one in the United States and four in foreign jurisdictions including Australia, Canada, Europe and Japan. Patents in this family are generally expected to expire in 2022, subject to possible patent term extensions. This license may be terminated if we fail to make payments thereunder, if we commit a material breach of our obligations thereunder, or if we make an assignment for benefit of creditors or have a petition in bankruptcy filed; also, we may terminate the license for any reason upon 30 days' prior written notice. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have paid an aggregate amount of approximately $250,000 under this license. In connection with the execution of this license, we paid an issue fee of approximately $175,000, and annual maintenance fees are approximately $15,000. In addition, we issued equity in the amount of approximately 8,500 shares of common stock in connection with this license. The license provides for running royalties equal to 0.25% of net sales of licensed products thereunder, payable on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis until the expiration of the last valid claim covering such product in such country. 
         We also have a fully paid-up, non-exclusive license to more than 20 United States and more than 50 foreign granted patents directed to various display library technologies as a result of our acquisition of Cosmix, which covers other rights related to our Extreme Diversity platform. These include patents that have been granted in the United States, Canada, China, Europe, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, and Taiwan. These patents are generally expected to expire between 2018 and 2022, subject to possible patent term extensions. We paid an aggregate amount of approximately $1.4 million and approximately 123,456 shares of common stock in connection with the Cosmix acquisition that includes this fully paid-up license, though no breakdown of amounts specifically attributable to this license is available.

    Trademark Protection 
         We have filed for protection and our marks are allowed in the United States for the RA PHARMACEUTICALS mark for goods and services, the RA PHARMA word mark for goods, and the RA PHARMA logo mark for goods. We have filed for protection for goods and services in foreign jurisdictions, including Europe, Australia and Canada for the RA PHARMACEUTICALS word mark, the RA PHARMA word mark, and the RA PHARMA logo mark. We have received a Notice of Opposition for the RA PHARMA word mark (Application No. 015611726). 
         We have filed for and obtained trademark protection in the United States for the RA PHARMA service word mark for "pharmaceutical research and development in the field of peptides and/or peptidomimetics; the foregoing services not related to rheumatoid arthritis." The mark is listed on the Principal Register, Registration No. 5022228. 
         We have filed for and obtained trademark protection in the United States for the RA PHARMA service mark logo for "pharmaceutical research and development in the field of peptides and/or peptidomimetics; the foregoing services not related to rheumatoid arthritis." The mark is listed on the Principal Register, Registration No. 5026109. 
         We have filed for and obtained trademark protection in Europe for the RA PHARMA logo mark for goods and services. The mark registered as Registration No. 015611775. 
   Trade Secret Protection 
         Finally, we may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. In particular, with the underlying patents expiring by 2022, we anticipate relying on trade secrets to protect the know-how behind our proprietary peptide chemistry platform. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For further information, please see "Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property." 
 Competition 
         The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
         There are a number of currently marketed products and product candidates in preclinical research and clinical development by third parties to treat the various diseases that we are targeting. In general, these products and product candidates can be categorized based on their proposed mechanisms of action. The mechanisms of action for these product candidates include inflammation suppression by

  agents such as complement inhibitors and corticosteroids, as well as immune modulators, visual cycle modulators, anti-amyloid agents, antioxidants, neuroprotectants, cell and gene therapies and vascular and interstitial tissue remodeling agents. 
         If our lead product candidates are approved for the indications for which we are currently undertaking clinical trials, they will compete with the products and product candidates discussed below. 
  PNH.    The principal competitor for our program in PNH is eculizumab, a C5 inhibitor, which is marketed as Soliris by Alexion Pharmaceuticals and is the only drug approved for the treatment of PNH. Alexion Pharmaceuticals is also developing a next-generation C5 inhibitor named ALXN 1210 that has a less frequent intravenous dosing schedule. In addition, we are aware that there are a number of other companies that are actively developing product candidates for the treatment of PNH, including the following:
 

 product candidates directed at C5 inhibition being developed by Alnylam that is in early clinical trials, Coversin, a small protein inhibitor
of C5 being developed by Akari Pharmaceuticals that is in early clinical trials, LFG316, a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of C5 being developed by Novartis Pharma and RO7112689, a monoclonal antibody
inhibitor of C5 being developed by F. Hoffman-La Roche; 
 a product candidate directed at C3 inhibition that is currently in preclinical development by Amyndas Pharmaceuticals; 
 a product candidate directed at C3 inhibition that is currently in clinical development by Apellis Pharmaceuticals; and 
 other product candidates directed at other mechanisms of complement inhibition such as an antibody against C1s, being developed by True North
Therapeutics in early clinical trials, and an orally available small molecule inhibitor of complement Factor D, that is currently in preclinical development by Achillion Pharmaceuticals. 

         Certain of our competitors are developing product candidates intended to be administered SC, IV or orally, with dosing frequencies ranging from twice daily to monthly, and with varying dose strengths and half-lives. We believe that the combination of SC administration, dose frequency and dose strength will allow RA101495 to provide improved control of hemolysis and suppression of breakthrough hemolysis. 
  LN.    There are no specific therapies for LN. Although approved for patients with active, autoantibody-positive, systemic lupus erythematosus who are receiving standard therapy, belimumab, which is marketed under the name Benlysta by GlaxoSmithKline, has not been evaluated in patients with LN. There are numerous phase 2 and later stage clinical studies on non-specific immunosuppressive agents, including agents currently used as standard of care in LN, with tacrolimus, mycophenolate, bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, azothioprim, voclosporin, laquinimod, and ACTHAR Gel being tested. In addition, a number of agents are being tested as targeted monoclonal antibody therapies, such as anti-CD40, anti-IL6, rituximab (anti-CD20), anti-TWEAK (an antibody directed against the TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis), and belimumab (anti BLys), as well as B7 antagonists such as CTLA4-Ig. The only complement pathway inhibitors proposed as targeted, disease-modifying agents in LN are OMS721, which is in Phase 2 development by Omeros, an anti-MASP-2 antibody that inhibits the mannose-binding lectin arm of the complement system, and eculizumab, where the antibody has shown benefit in a small number of published case report studies. There are no ongoing studies of eculizumab or any other C5 inhibitor in LN. 
  rMG.    rMG is currently treated with cholinesterase inhibitors and non-specific immunosuppressive agents, including azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, IV IG, mycophenolate, prednisone, and tacrolimus. Approximately 20% of patients are refractory to these therapies. Alexion Pharmaceuticals 
 27

  has recently presented Phase 3 data with eculizumab in rMG patients. While both Phase 2 and Phase 3 data were highly supportive of a treatment effect with eculizumab, the Phase 3 data narrowly missed the primary efficacy endpoint. Nonetheless, the data show promise for C5 inhibitor therapy in rMG. In January 2017, Alexion Pharmaceuticals announced that it had submitted marketing applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) eculizumab as a treatment for patients with refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive. Both rituximab, marketed by Roche, and belimumab, marketed by GlaxoSmithKline, which target B cell activity, are in clinical development for rMG. Anti-CD40, being developed as CFZ533 by Novartis, bortezomib, and a small molecule activator of the muscle protein troponin being developed as Cytokinetics by Tirasemtiv, are being tested in clinical trials in rMG. A therapeutic vaccine targeting B-and T-cell receptors (CV-MG-01) is in early clinical testing for rMG. 
  AMD.    There are currently no approved treatments for dry AMD or GA. We are aware that there are a number of companies that are actively developing product candidates for the treatment of GA, including the following product candidates that are in clinical development: lampalizumab, a Factor D complement inhibitor for the treatment of GA being developed by Roche that is in Phase 3 clinical trials; LFG316, an anti-C5 monoclonal antibody being developed by Novartis Pharma that has completed a 12 month Phase 2 study and failed to demonstrate efficacy (effectiveness) against the development of geographic atrophy, the end stage of dry age-related macular degeneration; Zimura, a C5 inhibitor being developed by Ophthotech Corporation that is entering Phase 2/3 clinical trials; APL-2, a C3 inhibitor developed by Apellis Pharmaceuticals; and other product candidates that do not target the complement system that are in Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials, including compounds being developed by Acucela, Allergan, GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis Pharma. There are no currently available treatments for intermediate AMD. 
  C1.    Many of our competitors are developing product candidates targeting C1 or indications that we may target with our C1 program. These include Soliris by Alexion Pharmaceuticals, which completed a Phase 2 trial targeting cold agglutinin disease; TNT-009, a C1s inhibitor being developed by True North Therapeutics that is in Phase 1 trials for cold agglutinin disease and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia; Fostamatinib, an oral Syk inhibitor being developed by Rigel Pharmaceuticals that is in Phase 2 trials for warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia; rituximab, a monoclonal antibody marketed under the name Rituxan by Roche that is currently in Phase 3 trials for warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia; and a C1q inhibitor being developed by Annexon that is in a preclinical phase for neurodegenerative diseases. 
   Sales and Marketing 
         We hold worldwide commercialization rights to all of our complement-mediated product candidates. Subject to receiving marketing approval, we intend to independently pursue the commercialization of RA101495 in PNH patients in the United States and Europe by building a focused sales and marketing organization in these geographies. We believe that such an organization will be able to address the community of physicians who are key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our product candidates are being developed. 
         We also plan to build a marketing and sales management organization to create and implement marketing strategies for any products that we market through our own sales organization and to oversee and support our sales force. The responsibilities of the marketing organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved products and establishing relationships with researchers and practitioners in relevant fields of medicine. 
         Outside of the United States and Europe, we may pursue the approval and commercialization of RA101495 for PNH patients either independently or in collaboration with others. We intend to develop 
 28

  and commercialize RA101495 for other indications independently or through collaborations with third parties. 
   Manufacturing 
         We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates. We intend to rely on third-party contract manufacturers to produce our products and have recruited personnel with experience to manage the third-party contract manufacturers producing our product candidates and other product candidates or products that we may develop in the future. 
         The process for manufacturing our product candidates consists of a multiple-stage-chemical synthesis, purification using liquid chromatography, and freeze drying into a powder form. The initial chemical synthesis process is similar to other cyclic peptide synthetic processes. For some of our products, the peptide is modified after cyclization using a common synthetic processes to attach bio-distribution modifying chemical moieties. We expect the costs associated with manufacturing drug substance for our product candidates to be comparable to the current manufacturing costs for other complex and similarly sized peptide-based components, and because our product candidates are synthetic, we believe they can be manufactured in a more cost effective manner relative to competitive biologic and monoclonal antibody therapies. 
         We currently engage two third-party manufacturers to provide clinical supplies of RA101495, an additional third-party manufacturer to provide non-clinical supplies of RA101495 and a different, single third-party manufacturer to provide fill-finish services for RA101495. 
   Government Regulation 
         Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
   Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States 
         In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. Although we have not yet selected the device component to use for administration of our lead product candidate, we expect that, if approved, our lead drug product candidate may be regulated as a combination product, which means that it is composed of both a drug product and device product. If marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and reviewed by different centers within the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a center that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination product's primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of our lead product candidate, we expect the primary mode of action to be attributable to the drug component of the product, which means that the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research would have primary jurisdiction over the premarket development, review and approval. The failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, 
 29

  imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities. In addition, an applicant may need to recall a product. 
         An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:
 

 completion of nonclinical, or preclinical, laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA's good
laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations; 
 submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin; 
 approval by an independent IRB representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
 performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety
and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication; 
 preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA; 
 review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; 
 satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof,
are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product's
identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data; 
 payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and 
 compliance with any post-approval requirements, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and post-approval studies
required by the FDA. 

 Preclinical Studies 
         Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
   Human Clinical Trials in Support of a NDA 
         Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols 
 30

  detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA can place an IND on full or partial clinical hold at any point in development, and depending upon the scope of the hold, clinical trial(s) may not restart until resolution of the outstanding concerns to the FDA's satisfaction. 
         In addition, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct a continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
         Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
 

 Phase 1.  The drug is
initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption,
metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage. 
 Phase 2.  The drug is
administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to
determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
 Phase 3.  The drug is
administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to evaluate the efficacy and
safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 
 Phase 4.  Post-approval
studies may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. 

         Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. 
 31


        Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the applicant must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
   Review of a NDA by the FDA 
         Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product's chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to an application user fee, currently exceeding $2.0 million, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $97,000 per product and $512,000 per establishment. These fees are typically increased annually. 
         The FDA conducts a preliminary review of a NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing, and most applications for "priority review" products are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 
         Before approving a NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with a NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. 
         In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product. 
 32

          The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
   Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations 
         The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation and priority review designation. 
         Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product's application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA's time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
         Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
         Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting adverse reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that is expected to lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA's goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. 
   Accelerated Approval Pathway 
         The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict 
 33

  clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
         For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a product, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product. 
         The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. 
         The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor's agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product's clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
   The FDA's Decision on a NDA 
         On the basis of the FDA's evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
         If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug's safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after 
 34

  commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
   Post-Approval Requirements 
         Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
         In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the NDA holder and any third-party manufacturers that the NDA holder may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
         Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

 restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary product recalls; 
 fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
 refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
 product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
 injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

         The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 35

          In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 
   Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 
         In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under a NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD. 
         Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is "bioequivalent" to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if "the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug." 
         Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is "therapeutically equivalent" to the RLD in its publication "Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations," also referred to as the "Orange Book." Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA's designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient. 
         Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, which states the proposed generic drug will not infringe the already approved product's listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. 
         The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved.

    Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay 
         Upon approval of a NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant's product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. An applicant who submits a section 505(b)(2) NDA, which is for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved drug products and where at least one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant for approval were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted, also must certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. 
         Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
 

 the required patent information has not been filed; 
 the listed patent has expired; 
 the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or 
 the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. 

         A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product's listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval). 
         If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
   Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity 
         Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, a NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA's internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 
 37


        The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 
         Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA's request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. 
   Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
         Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an "orphan drug" if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting a NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
         If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will be receiving orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
   Patent Term Restoration and Extension 
         A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a NDA, plus the time between the submission date of a NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product's approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.

    Europe/Rest of World Regulation 
         In addition to regulations in the United States, a manufacturer is subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of products, if approved. Even if a manufacturer obtains FDA approval of a product, it must still obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each country's national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the clinical trial application is approved in accordance with a country's requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under EU regulatory systems, a manufacturer must submit a marketing authorization application. More concretely, in the EEA (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations:
 

 The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for
Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of
products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune
and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic,
scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. 
 National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are
available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can
be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved
simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. 

         Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
         In Europe, the period of orphan drug exclusivity is ten years, although it may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the criteria for orphan drug designation are no longer met, in other words, when it is shown on the basis of available evidence that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. In September 2016, the EMA's Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products adopted a positive opinion recommending RA101495 for the treatment of PNH for designation as an orphan medicinal product to the European Commission, which will decide whether to grant an orphan designation. 
         For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product approval, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are to be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

    Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
         Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
         In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. Additionally, a payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor's determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. 
         The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
         Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our product candidates will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. 
         In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some 
 40

  countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements. 
   Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations 
         Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted regulatory approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting and physician sunshine laws. Some of our pre-commercial activities are subject to some of these laws. 
         The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer or a party acting on its behalf to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or provide any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order or recommendation or arranging of, any good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute's intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, and can also result in criminal fines, civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 
         The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Persons and entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to "cause" the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, any of our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for federal civil False Claims Act violations may include up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,781 and $21,563 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, False Claims Act violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. 
 41

          The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, to the extent that any of our product candidates, if approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws. 
         HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney's fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties. 
         The Affordable Care Act, or ACA, imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for "knowing failures." Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation or other remuneration to physicians. 
         Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we intend to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal control to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject. Although the development and implementation of compliance programs designed to establish internal control and facilitate compliance can mitigate the risk of investigation, prosecution, and penalties assessed for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. 
 42

          If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
   Healthcare Reform 
         There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. 
         By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the United States Congress passed the ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential drug candidates are:
 

 an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned
among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; 
 expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain
individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer's Medicaid rebate liability; 
 expansion of manufacturers' rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and
generic drugs and revising the definition of "average manufacturer price," or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices; 
 a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled,
infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 
 expansion of the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program; 
 establishment of the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount
off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers' outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare
Part D; and 
 a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research,
along with funding for such research. 

         Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several 
 43

  providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
         There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
