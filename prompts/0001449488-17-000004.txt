We are a provider of compression services and equipment for natural gas and oil production, gathering, transportation, processing, and storage. We sell standard and custom-designed compressor packages and oilfield fluid pump systems, and provide aftermarket services and compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers. We provide these compression services and equipment to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, and transmission companies operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States as well as in a number of foreign countries, including Mexico, Canada, and Argentina. We design and fabricate a majority of the compressor packages that we use to provide compression services and that we sell to customers.

We are one of the largest service providers of natural gas compression services in the United States, utilizing our fleet of compressor packages that employs a full spectrum of low-, medium-, and high-horsepower engines. Low-horsepower compressor packages enhance production for dry gas wells and liquid-loaded gas wells by deliquifying wells, lowering wellhead pressure, and increasing gas velocity. Our low-horsepower compressor packages are also utilized in connection with oil and liquids production and in vapor recovery and casing gas system applications. Low- to medium-horsepower compressor packages are typically utilized in wellhead and natural gas gathering systems and other applications primarily in connection with natural gas and oil production. Our high-horsepower compressor package offerings are typically utilized in natural gas production, natural gas gathering, centralized compression facilities, and midstream applications. 
Our equipment sales business includes the fabrication and sale of standard compressor packages, custom-designed compressor packages, and oilfield fluid pump systems designed and fabricated primarily at our facility in Midland, Texas. We design and fabricate natural gas reciprocating and rotary screw compressor packages up to 8,000 horsepower for sale to our customers. The compressor packages that we fabricate are sold to customers for their use in various applications including gas gathering, gas lift, carbon dioxide injection, wellhead compression, gas storage, refrigeration plant compression, gas processing, pressure maintenance, pipeline transmission, vapor recovery, gas transmission, fuel gas boosters, and coal bed methane systems. Our pump systems can be utilized in multiple applications including oil and liquids production, transfer, and pipeline transmission, as well as water injection and disposal and other systems.
Our aftermarket business provides a wide range of services to support the needs of customers who own compression equipment as well as the sale of compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers. These services include operations, maintenance, overhaul, and reconfiguration services and may be provided under turnkey engineering, procurement and construction contracts.

Our long-term growth strategy includes expanding our existing businesses – through internal growth and acquisitions – both in the U.S. and in select foreign countries.

Our operations are organized into a single business segment. For financial information regarding our revenues and total assets, see Note N –Geographic Information contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.

2014 Compressor Systems, Inc. Acquisition
On August 4, 2014, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated July 20, 2014, one of our subsidiaries acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Compressor Systems, Inc. ("CSI") for $825.0 million cash (the "CSI Acquisition"). The CSI Acquisition purchase price was funded by the sale and issuance of new senior notes and common units and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. A subsidiary of TETRA purchased a portion of the new equity issued and TETRA contributed cash to maintain its approximately 2% general partner interest in us following the offering of the new common units. The issuance of the new common units, including those purchased by TETRA, together with the contribution by TETRA of additional capital to maintain its general partner interest, resulted in the net reduction of TETRA’s ownership interest in us from approximately 82% to approximately 44%. Through TETRA’s wholly owned subsidiary, CSI Compressco GP Inc., TETRA manages and controls us. As of December 31, 2016, common units held by the public represent approximately a 56% ownership interest in us.

Certain of our domestic services are performed by our wholly owned subsidiary CSI Compressco Operating LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (our “Operating LLC”), pursuant to contracts that our legal counsel has concluded generate qualifying income under Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code, or “qualifying income.” We do not pay U.S. federal income taxes on the portion of our business conducted by Operating LLC. CSI Compressco Sub Inc. and CSI, which are also wholly owned subsidiaries of ours, conduct substantially all of our operations that our legal counsel has not concluded generate qualifying income, and pay U.S. federal income tax with respect to such operations. We strive to ensure that all new domestic compression contracts are entered into by our Operating LLC and generate qualifying income. We also pay state and local income taxes in certain states, and we incur income taxes related to our foreign operations.
We rely on our general partner’s board of directors and executive officers to manage our operations and make decisions on our behalf. Our general partner is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of TETRA. Unlike shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, our unitholders are not entitled to elect our general partner or its directors. All of our general partner’s directors are elected by TETRA. Our general partner does not receive any management fee in connection with its management of our business. However, our general partner is reimbursed for certain indirect and direct expenses, including compensation expenses, incurred on our behalf. In addition, our general partner receives distributions based on its limited and general partner interests and incentive distribution rights.

Strategy to Improve Liquidity and Strengthen Our Balance Sheet in 2016
During 2016, we were proactive in preparing for changes in the market environment by managing our cost structure, reducing capital expenditures, and strengthening our balance sheet. While remaining committed to a long-term growth strategy, our near-term focus during this period of reduced activity and demand was to preserve and enhance liquidity through strategic operating and financial measures.
These efforts included:

• | In May 2016 and November 2016, we entered into amendments of the agreement governing our bank revolving credit facility by, among other things, favorably amending certain financial covenants.


• | In August 2016 and September 2016, we issued and sold newly-authorized Series A Convertible Preferred Units (the "Preferred Units") in a private placement and used the aggregate net proceeds of $76.9 million to reduce outstanding indebtedness under our bank credit facility and 7.25% Senior Notes. TETRA purchased a portion of the Preferred Units for $10.0 million.

(For detailed information on each of these items, see “Item 7- Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.")

Each of the above described liquidity and balance sheet measures was implemented to position us to be able to capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise in connection with the long-anticipated recovery of the oil and gas services industry. In early 2017, we are seeing indicators of improving demand for certain of our products and services. We intend to continue taking the actions we believe appropriate to strengthen our balance sheet and to position us financially to be able to capitalize on opportunities in the recovering market.
Products and Services
We are a provider of compression services and equipment for natural gas and oil production, gathering, transmission, processing, and storage. Natural gas compression is a mechanical process in which the pressure of a given volume of natural gas is increased to a higher pressure. It is essential to the production and movement of natural gas. Compression is typically required numerous times in the natural gas production and sales cycle, including (i) at the wellhead, (ii) throughout gathering and distribution systems, (iii) into and out of processing and storage facilities and (iv) in natural gas pipelines. Compression is also utilized for gas lift, an artificial lift technique for producing oil that has insufficient reservoir pressure. We fabricate and sell standard compressor packages, custom-designed compressor packages, and oilfield fluid pump systems. We also provide aftermarket compression services and sell compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers. 
Compression Services
We utilize our fleet of compressor packages to provide a variety of compression services to our customers to meet their specific requirements. Our fleet includes approximately 6,000 compressor packages that provide more than 1.1 million in aggregate horsepower, employing a wide spectrum of low-, medium-, and high-horsepower engines. We fabricate our compressor packages primarily at our fabrication facility in Midland, Texas. The horsepower of our natural gas compressor package fleet as of December 31, 2016 is summarized in the following table:

Range of Horsepower Per Package | Number of Packages | Aggregate Horsepower | | % of Aggregate Horsepower
0 - 100 | 3,904 | | 183,100 | | 16.4 | %
101 - 800 | 1,626 | | 457,809 | | 41.1 | %
Over 800 | 353 | | 473,403 | | 42.5 | %
Total | 5,883 | | 1,114,312 | | 100.0 | %

Low-Horsepower (0-100 Horsepower) Compression Services. Our natural gas powered, low-horsepower compressor packages include our GasJack® packages that are relatively compact and easy to transport to our customer’s well site. We utilize our electric powered, low-horsepower VJack™ compressor packages to provide production enhancement services on wells where electric power is available. Our low-horsepower packages allow us to perform wellhead compression, fluids separation, and optional gas metering services all from one skid, thereby providing services that otherwise would generally require the use of multiple, more costly pieces of equipment. We utilize our low-horsepower compressor packages to provide production enhancement for dry gas wells and liquid-loaded gas wells and backside auto injection systems (“BAIS”). BAIS monitors tubing pressure to redirect gas flow into the casing annulus as needed to help gas wells unload liquids that hinder production. We also utilize our low-horsepower compressor packages to collect hydrocarbon vapors that are a by-product of oil production and storage (“vapor recovery”) and to reduce casing pressure of pumping oil wells to enhance oil production (“casing gas systems”). 

Medium-Horsepower (101-800 Horsepower) Compression Services. Our medium-horsepower compressor packages are primarily utilized to move natural gas from the wellhead through the field gathering system by boosting the pressure of the natural gas flowing through the system. Additionally, these compressor packages are used to reinject natural gas into producing vertical and horizontal oil wells that have insufficient reservoir pressure, to help lift liquids to the surface ("gas lift operations"). Typically, these applications require medium-horsepower compressor packages located at or near the wellhead. These compressor packages are also used to increase the efficiency of low-capacity natural gas fields by providing a central compression point from which the natural gas can be further processed and transported. These compressor packages feature primarily two- and three-stage compressors powered by natural gas engines ranging from 101 to 800 horsepower and equipped with interstage cooling. 
3

High-Horsepower (Over 800 Horsepower) Compression Services. Our high-horsepower compressor packages are primarily utilized in midstream applications including natural gas gathering and centralized compression facilities. They move natural gas from individual wells or a group of wells to boost the pressure while being moved into a gathering pipeline that leads to various types of processing facilities. A significant number of these compressor packages in midstream applications also serve the dual purpose of gas lift operations by injecting a percentage of the compressed natural gas into producing oil wells. Our high-horsepower compressor packages are also used in connection with the movement of natural gas from gathering systems to storage facilities or the end user. These compressor packages feature primarily two- and three-stage compressors powered by natural gas engines over 800 horsepower and equipped with interstage cooling. 
Other Related Services.    In certain Latin America markets, we provide well monitoring and sand separation services in connection with our primary low-horsepower compression services. Well monitoring services include a variety of services that monitor and optimize production from oil and gas wells. We utilize automated sand separators, which are high-pressure vessels with automated valve operation functions, at the well to remove solids that would otherwise cause abrasive wear damage to compression and other equipment that is installed downstream and inhibit production from the well. We also provide early production services (“EPS”) to a customer in Argentina through a subcontract with TETRA. We rent the related equipment from TETRA under a separate rental agreement. Under our agreement with TETRA, TETRA bears all of the risk associated with the EPS customer contract, and we retain a portion of the income generated under the EPS contract.
Compression Services Contract Terms. Prior to the CSI Acquisition, our compression services were primarily performed under service contracts using our low-horsepower compressor packages. A significant portion of these low-horsepower compression services are provided under services contracts that our legal counsel has concluded will generate qualifying income that is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes. Under these services contracts, we are responsible for providing our services in accordance with the particular specifications of a job. As owner and operator, we are responsible for operating and maintaining the equipment we utilize to provide our services. Our domestic services contracts typically have an initial term of one month and, unless terminated by us or our customers with 30-days' notice, continue on a month-to-month basis thereafter. We charge our customers a fixed monthly fee for the services provided under the contract. If the level of services we provide falls below certain contractually-specified percentages, other than as a result of factors beyond our control, our customers are generally entitled to request limited credits against our service fees. To date, these credits have been insignificant as a percentage of revenue. Although CSI's contract compression business is very similar in substance to ours, it was not conducted under service contracts. The CSI contracts typically have twelve month to twenty-four month initial terms and are month-to-month thereafter. Some customers may renew for additional twelve month extensions. Since our acquisition of CSI, we have transitioned a significant majority of CSI's pre-acquisition customer contracts to compression service contracts.

We generally own the equipment we use to provide services to our customers, and we bear the risk of loss to this equipment to the extent not caused by (i) a breach of certain obligations of the customer, primarily involving the service site and the fuel gas being supplied to us, or (ii) an uncontrolled well condition. Utilizing our proprietary, satellite telemetry-based reporting system, we remotely monitor, in real time, on most equipment, whether our services are being continuously provided at domestic customer well sites. 

As owner of the equipment, we are obligated to pay ad valorem taxes levied on the equipment and related insurance expenses, and we do not seek reimbursement for such taxes and expenses from our service agreement customers.
Equipment and Parts Sales

We fabricate and sell natural gas compressor packages for various applications, including: gas gathering, gas lift, carbon dioxide injection, wellhead compression, gas storage, refrigeration plant compression, gas processing, pressure maintenance, pipeline transmission, vapor recovery, pipeline station optimization, gas transmission, fuel gas boosters and coal bed methane systems.
We also fabricate and sell oilfield fluid pump systems through our wholly-owned Pump Systems International, Inc. subsidiary. The pump systems are fabricated at our facility in Midland, Texas or by third-party fabricators and they are sold primarily in South American, Asian and Middle Eastern markets.

  Aftermarket Business
Through our aftermarket operations, we provide a wide range of services to support the needs of customers who own compression equipment. The services provided are primarily operation, maintenance, overhaul and reconfiguration services, which may be provided under turnkey engineering, procurement and construction contracts. We also sell engine parts, compressor package parts, and other parts manufactured by third parties that are utilized in natural gas compressor packages. We have factory- and internally-trained technicians in most of the major oil and natural gas producing basins in the United States to perform these services. 
Compressor Package Fabrication Facilities and Sources of Raw Materials

At our fabrication facility in Midland, Texas, we design, engineer, and fabricate a wide spectrum of natural gas reciprocating and rotary screw compressor packages up to 8,000 horsepower, including both standard field compression equipment meeting industry standards and specialty engineered compression equipment designed for unique customer specifications. We internally fabricate skids, pressure vessels built to American Society of Mechanical Engineers code, and piping systems and integrate them with engines, compressors, and other components obtained from third-party suppliers. The compressor packages are used in our services business and they are sold to major and independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies as well as midstream processing and transmission companies. We design, engineer, fabricate, and market high quality gas compressor packages that have a superior reputation in the industry as indicated by occasional sales to competitive fleets and to end users who have their own compressor package fabrication capabilities. 
A majority of the components we use to fabricate compressor packages and pump systems are obtained from third-party suppliers. These components represent a significant portion of the cost of the compressor packages and pump systems. Some of the components used in the assembly of our compressor packages and pump systems are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Typical contracts with these suppliers are for a period of twelve months. Should we experience a lack of availability of the components we use to fabricate our packages and systems, we believe that there are adequate, alternative suppliers and that any impact would not be severe, although short-term disruptions could be material. We occasionally experience long lead times for components from suppliers and, therefore, at times make purchases in anticipation of future orders.
Market Overview and Competition

Our operations are significantly dependent upon the demand for, and production of, natural gas and oil in the various domestic and international markets in which we operate. Beginning in 2014 and continuing throughout most of 2016, reduced prices of natural gas and oil led to declines in our customers' capital expenditure levels in the domestic and international markets in which we operate. The decline in activity in the natural gas and oil exploration and production industry resulted in reduced demand for our products and services compared to early 2014 levels, which is expected to continue. With the increase in oil and gas pricing in the second half of 2016 and in early 2017, we are seeing indicators of improving demand for certain of our products and services. 
Customers

We provide services to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, pipeline transmission, and storage companies operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States. We also have operations in Latin America and certain other foreign regions. While most of our domestic services are performed throughout Texas, the San Juan Basin, the Rocky Mountain region, and the Mid-Continent region of the United States, we also have a presence in other U.S. producing regions. We continue to seek opportunities to further expand our operations into other regions in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.
 Our service contracts are generally terminable upon thirty days’ notice after the primary term has expired. Although we enter into short-term contracts, many of our largest customers have been with us for over five years. Our most significant customer for the year ended December 31, 2016 was ConocoPhillips which accounted for approximately 11.2% of our consolidated revenues for the year. Other major customers included Anadarko, Cimarex Energy, Denbury Onshore, and Targa Resources, none of which individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. The loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.

Competition

The natural gas compression services and compressor package fabrication and sale businesses are highly competitive. We experience competition from companies that may be able to more quickly adapt to changes within our industry and changes in economic conditions as a whole, more readily take advantage of available opportunities, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Primary competition for our low-horsepower compression services business comes from smaller local and regional companies that utilize packages consisting of a screw or reciprocating compressor with a separate engine driver. These local and regional competitors tend to compete with us on the basis of price, as opposed to our focus on providing production enhancement value to the customer. Competition for our mid- and high-horsepower compression services business comes primarily from large national and multinational companies that may have greater financial resources than ours. Such competitors include ArchRock, AXIP Energy Services, Exterran, CDM Resource Management, J-W Power, and USA Compression. Our competition in the standard compressor package fabrication and sale markets includes several large companies and a large number of small, regional fabricators, including some of those who we compete with for compression services, as well as AG Equipment Company, Enerflex, SEC Energy Products & Services, and others. Our competition in the custom-designed market usually consists of larger companies with the ability to provide integrated projects and product support after the sale, including some of the competitors noted above. The ability to fabricate these large custom-designed packages at our facilities near the point of end-use of many customers is often a competitive advantage. 

Many of our compression services competitors compete on the basis of price. We believe our pricing has proven to be competitive because of the significant increases in the value that results from use of our services, our customer service, trained field personnel, and the quality of the compressor packages we use to provide our services.

Other Business Matters

Marketing

We utilize various marketing strategies to promote our services and compressor package and pump system products. Our account managers attempt to build close working relationships with our existing and potential customers to educate them about our services and products by scheduling personal visits, hosting and attending tradeshows and conferences, and participating in industry organizations. We sponsor and make presentations at industry events that are targeted to production managers, compression specialists, and other decision makers. Our marketing representatives also use these marketing opportunities to promote our value-added service initiatives, such as the use of our proprietary satellite telemetry-based system, our wellsite optimization program, and our call center.
Backlog

Our equipment and parts sales business consists of the fabrication and sale of standard compressor packages, custom-designed compressor packages, and pump systems. Our custom-designed packages are typically greater in size and complexity than standard fabrication packages, requiring more labor, materials, and overhead resources. This business requires diligent planning of those resources and project and backlog management in order to meet the customer's desired delivery dates and performance criteria, and achieve fabrication efficiencies. As of December 31, 2016, our equipment sales backlog was approximately $21.6 million, most of which is expected to be recognized in the year ended December 31, 2017, based on title passing to the customer, the customer assuming the risks of ownership, reasonable assurance of collectability, and delivery occurring as directed by our customer. This backlog consists of firm customer orders for which a purchase or work order has been received, satisfactory credit or financing arrangements exist, and delivery has been scheduled. This backlog is a measure of marketing effectiveness that allows us to plan future labor and raw material needs and measure our success in winning bids from our customers.
Employees

As of December 31, 2016, our general partner and certain of our subsidiaries had approximately 600 full-time employees who provide services to conduct our operations. Our general partner’s U.S. employees and our employees in Canada are not subject to collective bargaining agreements. Under our Omnibus Agreement with TETRA, certain employees of TETRA and its affiliates also provide services to our general partner, us, and our 
6

subsidiaries, and we reimburse TETRA for these services. Our employees in Argentina and Mexico are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. The employees of TETRA who provide services to us in Argentina and Mexico are subject to numerous collective labor agreements. We believe that the various employers of these employees have good relations with these employees and we have not experienced work stoppages in the past.

Proprietary Technology and Trademarks

It is our practice to enter into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, and third parties to whom we disclose our confidential and proprietary information. There can be no assurance, however, that these measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our trade secrets and expertise or that others may not independently develop similar trade secrets or expertise. Our management believes, however, that it would require a substantial period of time and substantial resources to independently develop similar know-how or technology.

We sell various services and products under a variety of trademarks and service marks, some of which are registered in the United States.

Health, Safety, and Environmental Affairs Regulations
We believe that our service and sales operations and fabricating plants are in substantial compliance with all applicable U.S. and foreign health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. We are committed to conducting all of our operations under the highest standards of safety and respect for the environment. However, risks of substantial costs and liabilities are inherent in certain of our operations and in the development and handling of certain products and equipment produced or used at our plants, well locations, and worksites. Because of these risks, there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future. Changes in environmental and health and safety regulations could subject us to more rigorous standards. We cannot predict the extent to which our operations may be affected by future regulatory and enforcement policies.
We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of human health and the environment. The primary environmental laws that impact our operations in the United States include:

• | the Clean Air Act and comparable state laws, and regulations thereunder, which regulate air emissions;


• | the Clean Water Act and comparable state laws, and regulations thereunder, which regulate the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, including industrial wastewater discharges and storm water runoff;


• | the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or (“RCRA”), and comparable state laws, and regulations, thereunder, which regulate the management and disposal of solid and hazardous waste; and


• | the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or (“CERCLA”), and comparable state laws, and regulations thereunder, known more commonly as “Superfund,” which impose liability for the cleanup of releases of hazardous substances in the environment.


Our operations in the United States are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") and comparable state laws, and regulations thereunder, which regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers.

The Clean Air Act and implementing regulations and comparable state laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements, including requirements related to emissions from certain stationary engines. These laws and regulations impose limits on the levels of various substances that may be emitted into the atmosphere from our compressor packages and require us to meet more stringent air emission standards and install new emission control equipment on all of our engines built after July 1, 2008. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") issued regulations in April 2012 that require the reduction of emissions of volatile organic compounds, air toxins, and methane, a greenhouse gas, at certain oil and gas operations. We are not currently aware of material impacts to our operations associated with these rules.
The EPA has determined that greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment because, according to the EPA, they contribute to global warming and climate change. As a result, the EPA has begun to regulate certain sources of greenhouse gases, including air emissions associated with oil and gas production particularly as they relate to the hydraulic fracturing of natural gas wells. In addition, the EPA has 
7

issued regulations requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain sources including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore oil and gas processing, transmission, storage, and distribution facilities. Reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from such facilities is required on an annual basis. The EPA’s rules relating to emissions of greenhouse gases from large stationary sources of emissions are currently subject to a number of legal challenges, but the federal courts have thus far declined to issue any injunctions to prevent the EPA or state environmental agencies from implementing the rules. Further, Congress has considered, and almost one-half of the states have adopted, legislation that seeks to control or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from a wide range of sources.

The Clean Water Act and implementing regulations and comparable state laws and regulations prohibit the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters without a permit and establish limits on the levels of pollutants contained in these discharges. In addition, the Clean Water Act and other comparable laws and regulations regulate storm water discharges associated with industrial activities depending on a facility’s primary standard industrial classification. Our facilities are in compliance with these requirements, as necessary.

RCRA and implementing regulations and state laws and regulations address the management and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. These laws and regulations govern the generation, storage, treatment, transfer, and disposal of wastes including, but not limited to, used oil, antifreeze, filters, sludges, and paint, solvents and sandblast materials. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for these types of wastes. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable requirements.

CERCLA and comparable state laws and regulations impose strict, joint, and several liabilities without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of a disposal site where a hazardous substance release occurred and any company that transported, disposed of, or arranged for the transport or disposal of such hazardous substances released at a site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be liable for the costs of remediating the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies.

We believe that we have properly disposed of all historical waste streams and we have no outstanding liability regarding any past waste handling or spill activities; however, there is always the possibility that future spills and releases of petroleum hydrocarbons, wastes, or other regulated substances into the environment could cause us to become subject to remediation costs and liabilities under CERCLA, RCRA, or other environmental laws. The costs and liabilities associated with the future imposition of remedial obligations could have the potential for a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position.

We are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes. These laws and regulations strictly govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA, and similar state statutes require that we maintain and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these requirements and other applicable similar laws.
Our compressor packages may be subject to additional regulatory requirements under the Clean Air Act. For example, regulations under the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAPS”) provisions of the Clean Air Act require control of hazardous air pollutants from new and existing stationary reciprocal internal combustion engines. Our equipment is also subject to additional prescribed maintenance practices and catalyst installation may also be required. More recently, the EPA finalized rules that establish new air emission controls under the New Source Performance Standards and NESHAPS for natural gas and natural gas liquids production, processing and transportation activities. These rules establish specific requirements associated with emissions from compressors and controllers at natural gas gathering and boosting stations.
We design and fabricate our compressor packages to meet applicable customer and government regulatory health, safety, and environmental requirements. Our operations outside the United States are subject to foreign governmental laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety, and other regulated activities. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with existing foreign governmental laws and regulations.

Under the Omnibus Agreement, we or TETRA may, but neither of us is under any obligation to, sell, lease, or like-kind exchange to the other such production enhancement or other oilfield services equipment as is needed or desired, in such amounts, upon such conditions, and for such periods of time, as may be mutually agreed upon by TETRA and our general partner. Any such sales, leases, or like-kind exchanges are required to be on terms that are (i) approved by the conflicts committee of our general partner’s board of directors, (ii) no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from non-affiliated third parties, as determined by our general partner, or (iii) fair and reasonable to us, taking into account the totality of the relationships between TETRA and us (including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us), as determined by our general partner. In addition, TETRA may purchase newly fabricated equipment from us at a negotiated price provided that such price may not be less than the sum of the total costs (other than any allocations of general and administrative expenses) incurred by us in fabricating such equipment plus a fixed margin percentage thereof, and TETRA may purchase from us previously fabricated equipment for a price that is not less than the sum of the net book value of such equipment plus a fixed margin percentage thereof, unless otherwise approved by the conflicts committee of our general partner’s board of directors, .

The Omnibus Agreement, as amended in June 2014 to extend its term, will terminate (other than the indemnification obligations contained therein) upon the earlier to occur of a change of control of the general partner or TETRA or upon any party providing at least 180 days' prior written notice of termination.

In addition to the Omnibus Agreement, we have entered into other operational agreements with TETRA. For a more comprehensive discussion of the Omnibus Agreement and other agreements we have entered into with TETRA, please see “Item 13 – Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.”
