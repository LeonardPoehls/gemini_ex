Overview 
 We are a leading provider of temporary mechanical circulatory support devices, and we offer a continuum of care to heart failure patients. We develop, manufacture and market proprietary products that are designed to enable the heart to rest, heal and recover by improving blood flow to the coronary arteries and end-organs and/or temporarily assisting the pumping function of the heart. Our products are used in the cardiac catheterization lab, or cath lab, by interventional cardiologists, the electrophysiology lab, the hybrid lab and in the heart surgery suite by heart surgeons. A physician may use our devices for patients who are in need of hemodynamic support prophylactically, urgently or emergently before, during or after angioplasty or heart surgery procedures. We believe that heart recovery is the optimal clinical outcome for a patient experiencing heart failure because it enhances the potential for the patient to go home with the patient’s native heart, facilitating the restoration of quality of life. In addition, we believe, that for the care of such patients, heart recovery is often the most cost-effective solution for the healthcare system.
 Our strategic focus, which has resulted in the majority of our revenue growth is the market penetration of our family of Impella® heart pumps. The Impella device portfolio, which includes the Impella 2.5®, Impella CP®, Impella RP®, Impella LD® and Impella 5.0® devices, has supported numerous patients worldwide. We expect that almost all of our product and service revenue in the near future will be from our Impella devices. Revenues from our non-Impella devices, largely focused on the heart surgery suite, have been decreasing over the past several years and are expected to be insignificant as we have strategically shifted our sales and marketing efforts towards our Impella devices, primarily in the cath lab.
 In March 2015, we received a Pre-Market Approval, or PMA, from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for use of the Impella 2.5 device during elective and urgent high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI, procedures. In December 2016, the FDA expanded this PMA approval in the U.S. to include the Impella CP device. With these PMA indications, the Impella 2.5 and Impella CP devices provide the only minimally invasive hemodynamic support treatment options indicated for use during high-risk PCI procedures. In April 2016, the FDA approved a PMA supplement for our Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0 and Impella LD devices to provide treatment for ongoing cardiogenic shock that occurs following a heart attack or open heart surgery. The intent of the Impella system therapy is to reduce ventricular work and to provide the circulatory support necessary to allow heart recovery and early assessment of residual myocardial function.
 In March 2017, we submitted a PMA application for Impella RP. We expect to continue to make additional PMA supplement submissions for our suite of Impella devices for additional indications.
 Our Impella 2.5, Impella 5.0, Impella LD, Impella CP and Impella RP devices also have CE Mark approval and Health Canada approval, which allows us to market these devices in the European Union and Canada.
 In September 2016, we received Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or PMDA, approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour & Welfare for our Impella 2.5 and Impella 5.0 heart pumps to provide treatment of drug-resistant acute heart failure in Japan. We are preparing for the market launch in Japan, including working with Japanese government authorities to obtain appropriate reimbursement for these products. We do not expect to have any material revenue in Japan during fiscal 2018. 
 In May 2017, we announced the enrollment of the first patient in the FDA approved prospective feasibility study, STEMI Door to Unloading with Impella CP system in acute myocardial infarction. This trial will focus on feasibility and safety of unloading the left ventricle using the Impella CP heart pump prior to primary PCI in patients presenting with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, or STEMI, without cardiogenic shock with the hypothesis that this will potentially reduce infarct size. The study, which received Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, approval from the FDA in October 2016, is a prospective, multi-center feasibility study. Up to 50 patients at 10 sites will be enrolled in the study. We enrolled the first patient in this study in April 2017 and we expect to complete enrollment in fiscal 2019.

 Our Products 
 Impella 2.5®
 The Impella 2.5 device is a percutaneous micro heart pump with an integrated motor and sensors. The device is designed primarily for use by interventional cardiologists to support patients in the cath lab who may require assistance to maintain circulation. The Impella 2.5 heart pump can be quickly inserted via the femoral artery to reach the left ventricle of the heart where it is directly deployed to draw blood out of the ventricle and deliver it to the circulatory system. This function is intended to reduce ventricular work and provide blood flow to vital organs. The Impella 2.5 heart pump is introduced with normal interventional cardiology procedures and can pump up to 2.5 liters of blood per minute.
 The Impella 2.5 device received 510(k) clearance from the FDA in June 2008 for partial circulatory support for up to six hours. In March 2015, we received a PMA from the FDA for the use of the Impella 2.5 device during elective and urgent high-risk PCI procedures. With this PMA indication, the Impella 2.5 device became the first FDA approved hemodynamic support device for use during high-risk PCI procedures. Under this first PMA, the Impella 2.5 is a temporary (up to six hours) ventricular support device indicated for use during high-risk PCI performed in elective or urgent hemodynamically stable patients with severe coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, when a heart team, including a cardiac surgeon, that has determined high-risk PCI is the appropriate therapeutic option. Use of the Impella 2.5 device in these patients may prevent hemodynamic instability that may occur during planned temporary coronary occlusions and may reduce periprocedural and post-procedural adverse events. The product labeling allows for the clinical decision by physicians to leave the Impella 2.5 device in place beyond the intended duration of up to six hours should unforeseen circumstances arise. Pursuant to our PMA approval requirements, we are conducting a single-arm, post-approval study on the Impella 2.5 device, collecting data on high-risk PCI patients. The study is a prospective, multi-center study comprised of 369 patients from up to 70 sites supported with the Impella 2.5 system.
 In April 2016, the FDA approved a supplement to our March 2015 PMA approval for the use of our Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0 and Impella LD devices to provide treatment for ongoing cardiogenic shock. This PMA supplement covers a set of indications related to the use of the Impella devices in patients suffering cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery and allows for a longer duration of support. 
 The data submitted to the FDA in support of the PMA supplement included an analysis of 415 patients from the RECOVER 1 study and the U.S. Impella registry, or cVAD Registry™, as well as a literature review using the Impella devices in 692 patients from 17 clinical studies. The PMA supplement also included a safety analysis evalulating the information in the FDA medical device reporting, or MDR, database, following the use of the Impella devices in more than 24,000 patients and which draws from seven years of experience using the Impella devices in the U.S. We believe this is the most comprehensive review ever submitted to the FDA for circulatory support in the cardiogenic shock population.
 Pursuant to the April 2016 PMA approval, the Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0 and Impella LD catheters, in conjunction with the Automated Impella Controller, or AIC, were approved as temporary ventricular support devices intended for short term use (≤ 4 days for the Impella 2.5 and Impella CP, and ≤ 6 days for the Impella 5.0 and LD) and indicated for the treatment of ongoing cardiogenic shock that occurs immediately (< 48 hours) following acute myocardial infarction or open heart surgery as a result of isolated left ventricular failure that is not responsive to optimal medical management and conventional treatment measures. The intent of the Impella system therapy is to reduce ventricular work and to provide the circulatory support necessary to allow heart recovery and early assessment of residual myocardial function.  Optimal medical management and convention treatment measures include volume loading and use of pressors and inotropes, with or without an intraortic balloon pump, or IABP.
 The Impella 2.5 device has CE Mark approval in Europe for up to five days of use and is approved for use in up to 40 countries. The Impella 2.5 device also has Health Canada approval which allows us to market the device in Canada.
 In September 2016, we received PMDA approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour & Welfare for our Impella 2.5 and Impella 5.0 heart pumps to provide treatment of drug-resistant acute heart failure in Japan. We are preparing for the market launch 
 2


in Japan, including working with Japanese government authorities to obtain reimbursement for these products.  We do not expect to have any material revenue in Japan during fiscal 2018.
 We expect to continue to make additional PMA supplement submissions for our Impella devices for additional clinical indications.  
 Impella CP®
 In September 2012, we announced that the Impella CP device
 received 510(k) clearance from the FDA. The Impella CP device provides blood flow of approximately one liter more per minute
 than the Impella 2.5 device and is primarily used by either interventional cardiologists to support patients in the cath lab or by cardiac surgeons in the heart surgery suite.
 In April 2016, the FDA approved the PMA supplement for certain of our devices, including our Impella CP device to provide treatment for ongoing cardiogenic shock.
 In December 2016, we received PMA approval from the FDA for the use of the Impella CP device during elective and urgent high-risk PCI procedures, identical to the indication for use for the Impella 2.5 device.  This approval allows the Impella CP to be used as a temporary (≤ 6 hours) ventricular support system indicated for use during high risk PCI procedures performed in elective or urgent hemodynamically stable patients with severe coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, when a heart team, including a cardiac surgeon, has determined that high risk PCI is the appropriate therapeutic option. The product labeling allows for the clinical decision by physicians to leave the Impella CP device in place beyond the intended duration of up to six hours should unforeseen circumstances arise.
 In May 2017, we announced the enrollment of the first patient in the FDA approved prospective feasibility study, STEMI Door to Unloading with Impella CP system in acute myocardial infarction. This trial will focus on feasibility and safety of unloading the left ventricle using the Impella CP heart pump prior to primary PCI in patients presenting with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, or STEMI, without cardiogenic shock with the hypothesis that this will potentially reduce infarct size. The study, which received Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, approval from the FDA in October 2016, is a prospective, multi-center feasibility study. Up to 50 patients at 10 sites will be enrolled in the study. We enrolled the first patient in this study in April 2017 and we expect to complete enrollment in fiscal 2019.
 The primary endpoints of the feasibility study will focus on safety, including Adverse Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Events, or MACCE, at 30 days. All patients will undergo cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to assess infarct size as a percent of left ventricular mass at 30 days post-PCI. Patients will be randomized to Impella CP placement with immediate primary PCI, or to Impella CP placement with 30 minutes of unloading prior to primary PCI. The hypothesis of this novel approach to treating STEMI patients, based on extensive mechanistic research, is that unloading the left ventricle prior to PCI reduces myocardial work load, oxygen demand and also initiates a cardio-protective effect at the myocardial cell level, which may alleviate myocardial damage caused by reperfusion injury at the time of revascularization. This feasibility study will help refine the protocol and lay the groundwork for a future pivotal study with more sites and patients and will be designed for statistical significance. 
 We expect to continue to make additional PMA supplement submissions for our Impella devices for additional clinical indications.  
 The Impella CP device has CE Mark approval in Europe for up to five days of use and is approved for use in up to 40 countries.
 Impella 5.0® and Impella LD®
 The Impella 5.0 and Impella LD devices are percutaneous micro heart pumps with integrated motors and sensors for use primarily in the heart surgery suite. These devices are designed to support patients who require higher levels of circulatory support as compared to the Impella 2.5.
 The Impella 5.0 device can be inserted into the left ventricle via femoral cut down or through the axillary artery. The Impella 5.0 device is passed into the ascending aorta, across the valve and into the left ventricle. The Impella LD device is similar to the Impella 5.0 device, but it is implanted directly into the ascending aorta through an aortic graft.  Both of these procedures are normally performed with the assistance of heart surgeons in the surgery suite. The Impella 5.0 and Impella LD devices can pump up to five liters of blood per minute, potentially providing full circulatory support.

The Impella 5.0 and Impella LD devices originally received 510(k) clearance in April 2009, for circulatory support for up to six hours.  In April 2016, the FDA approved the PMA supplement for certain of our devices, including our Impella 5.0 and Impella LD devices to provide treatment for ongoing cardiogenic shock following a heart attack or open heart surgery.
 The Impella 5.0 and Impella LD devices have CE Mark approval in Europe for up to ten days’ duration and are approved for use in over 40 countries.
 In September 2016, we received PMDA approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor & Welfare for our Impella 2.5 and Impella 5.0 heart pumps to provide treatment of drug-resistant acute heart failure in Japan. We are preparing for the market launch in Japan, including working with Japanese government authorities to obtain reimbursement for these products. We do not expect to have any material revenue in Japan during fiscal 2018.
 Impella RP®
 The Impella RP is a percutaneous catheter-based axial flow pump that is designed to allow greater than four liters of blood flow per minute and is intended to provide the flow and pressure needed to compensate for right side heart failure. The Impella RP is the first percutaneous single access heart pump designed for right heart support to receive FDA approval. The Impella RP device is approved to provide support of the right heart during times of acute failure for certain patients who have received a left ventricle assist device or have suffered heart failure due to acute myocardial infarction, or AMI, a failed heart transplant, or following open heart surgery.
 In November 2012, the Impella RP device received U.S. investigational device exemption, or IDE, approval from the FDA for use in RECOVER RIGHT, a pivotal clinical study in the U.S. This was a 30 patient study that presented signs of right side heart failure, required hemodynamic support, and were capable of being treated in the catheterization lab or cardiac surgery suite. The study was completed in March 2014 and collected safety and effectiveness data on the percutaneous use of the Impella RP device and was submitted to the FDA in support of a Humanitarian Device Exemption, or HDE, submission. An HDE is similar to a PMA application but is intended for patient populations of 8,000 or less per year in the U.S. and is subject to certain profit and use restrictions.  In December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act increased the upper population limit for an HDE from 4,000 to 8,000. An HDE approval requires demonstration of the safety and probable benefit of the product, which is a lower standard than is applied to a PMA. In order to receive an HDE, there must be no comparable devices approved under a PMA that are available to treat the targeted population. An approved HDE authorizes sales of the device to any hospital after review and approval by the hospital’s Institutional Review Board. In January 2015, we received HDE approval for the Impella RP device from the FDA. As part of the HDE approval, we were required to conduct post approval studies for the Impella RP device. We have completed our Impella RP post-market studies and submitted a PMA application in March 2017 with the FDA to convert our HDE approval to a PMA.
 In April 2014, the Impella RP device received CE Mark approval which allows for commercial sales of the Impella RP device in the European Union and other countries that require a CE Mark approval for commercial sales.
 AB5000™
 The AB5000 Circulatory Support System is for the temporary support of acute heart failure patients in profound shock, including patients suffering from cardiogenic shock after a heart attack, post-cardiotomy cardiogenic shock, or myocarditis. The AB5000 device was approved by the FDA in 2003. Revenues
 from the AB5000 device have been declining in recent years and we do not expect to have any significant revenues from this product in the future. We are no longer producing the AB5000 product as we focus our efforts on the Impella family of devices.
 ECP
 In July 2014, we acquired all of the issued shares of ECP Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH, or ECP, a German limited liability company, for $13.0 million in cash, with additional potential payments up to a maximum of $15.0 million based on the achievement of certain technical, regulatory and commercial milestones. In connection with this acquisition, ECP acquired all of the issued shares of AIS GmbH Aachen Innovative Solutions, or AIS, a German limited liability company, for $2.8 million in cash which was provided by us. AIS, based in Aachen, Germany, holds certain intellectual property useful to ECP’s business, and, prior to being acquired by ECP, had licensed such intellectual property to ECP. 
 ECP, based in Berlin, Germany, is engaged in research, development, prototyping and the pre-serial production of a percutaneous expandable catheter pump which increases blood circulation from the heart with an external drive shaft.  The ECP pump is designed for blood flow of >3 liters/minute.  It is intended to be delivered on the standard Impella 9 Fr catheter using the Impella Automated Controller console and will include an 18 Fr expandable inflow in the left ventricle with a smooth membrane crossing the 
 4


left ventricle. The Impella ECP™ pump is still in early stages of research and development and has not been approved for commercial use or sale.
 Summary of Recent Financial Performance 
 For fiscal 2017, we recognized net income of $52.1 million, or $1.21 per basic share and $1.17 per diluted share, compared to $38.1 million, or $0.90 per basic share and $0.85 per diluted share for the prior fiscal year. For fiscal year 2017, total revenue was $445.3 million, up 35% compared to revenue of $329.5 million in fiscal year 2016. The increase in our net income for fiscal 2017 was driven primarily by higher Impella product revenue due to greater utilization of our Impella devices in the U.S. and Germany. Information regarding our total assets are contained within our consolidated financial statements in this Report.
 Our Markets 
 According to the AHA’s Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics 2017 Update Report, coronary heart disease, or CHD, causes approximately one of every seven deaths in the U.S. CHD is a condition of the coronary arteries that causes reduced blood flow and insufficient oxygen delivery to the affected portion of the heart. CHD leads to acute myocardial infarction, or AMI, commonly known as a heart attack, which may lead to heart failure, a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to the body’s major organs. 
 A broad spectrum of therapies exists for the treatment of patients in early stages of CHD. Angioplasty procedures and stents are commonly used in the cath lab to restore and increase blood flow to the heart. These treatments are often successful in slowing the progression of heart disease, extending life, and/or improving the quality of life for some period of time. Patients presenting with acute cardiac injuries potentially have recoverable hearts. Treatment for these patients in pre-shock in the cath lab is primarily focused on hemodynamic stabilization. Acute heart failure patients in profound shock typically require treatment in the surgery suite. These are patients suffering from cardiogenic shock after a heart attack, post-cardiotomy cardiogenic shock or myocarditis complicated with cardiogenic shock. Chronic heart failure patients have hearts that are unlikely to be recoverable due to left and/or right-side heart failure and their conditions cause their hearts to fail over time. Limited therapies exist today for patients with severe, end-stage, or chronic heart failure. 
 In more severe cases of heart failure, patients are sent directly to the surgery suite for coronary bypass or valve replacement surgery. The most severe acute heart failure patients are in profound cardiogenic shock, including those suffering from myocarditis (a viral attack of the heart), or from those suffering from an impaired ability of the heart to pump blood after a heart attack or heart surgery. These patients typically require treatments involving the use of mechanical circulatory support devices that provide increased blood flow and reduce the stress on the heart. Many less severe patients in the cath lab could also benefit from circulatory support devices or other clinical treatment, which could potentially prevent them from entering into profound shock. 
 There are a few primary types of devices used in the cath lab and surgery suite in the U.S. for circulatory support for pre-shock and profound shock patients: intra-aortic balloons, or IABs, percutaneous assist devices, and surgical ventricular assist devices, or VADs. 
 An IAB is an inflatable balloon inserted via a catheter into a patient’s circulatory system and is inflated and deflated in the aorta. This is used as an initial line of therapy in the cath lab or the surgery suite for patients with diminished heart function. However, IABs typically provide only limited enhancement and depend on the patient’s own heart to generate the majority of the patient’s blood flow. In addition, IABs are often required to be used in conjunction with inotropes or other drugs to stimulate heart muscle ejection. The use of these drugs, however, increases the risk of mortality. Further, the clinical efficacy of IABs has been challenged due to the conclusions of the randomized, prospective, open-label, multicenter “SHOCK II” Trial. The conclusion of the trial was that the use of IAB counterpulsation did not significantly reduce 30-day mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction for whom an early revascularization strategy was planned. Further, IABs have limited effectiveness in patients that are arrhythmic and/or in cardiogenic shock and published reports have indicated that IABs do not reduce mortality for patients in cardiogenic shock. 
 Percutaneous assist devices and VADs are mechanical devices that help the failing heart pump blood or take over the pumping function of the failing heart. Historically, VADs have been highly invasive and require implantation in the surgery suite. Percutaneous assist devices allow for less invasive placement and removal, and can be done through a small puncture in the leg in the cath lab, electrophysiology lab, or operating room. The use of surgically placed VADs generally falls into three sub-categories: recovery, bridge-to-transplant and destination therapy. 
 5


Recovery VADs are designed to enable the patient’s heart to rest and potentially recover so that the patient can return home with his or her own heart. Because recovery is the goal, these devices are designed to minimize damage to heart tissue and are removed once the patient’s heart has recovered. If possible, recovery of a patient’s heart is generally preferred to transplantation or prolonged device implantation, both of which have significant side effects for the patient and increase the risk of mortality. We believe heart recovery is a preferred clinical outcome for patients, since it generally lowers the overall relative cost to the healthcare system versus alternative therapies and treatment paths that may require multiple surgeries, lengthy or repeated hospital stays, chronic therapeutic and immunosuppressant drugs and other related healthcare costs. 
 Research and Product Development 
 Since our founding in 1981, we have gained substantial expertise in circulatory support through the development of many product platforms to support heart patients. This includes our Impella platform that we currently market and other technologies that we have supported, such as our AB5000 systems. We also continue to work on developing new technologies as well, such as the ECP development program. Our current strategy is to develop a complete portfolio of products across the continuum of care in heart recovery, primarily focused in the area of circulatory care. We intend to continue to use this experience to develop additional circulatory support products as well as making enhancements to our existing products. In addition, we have a number of new products at various stages of development, some of which integrate the Impella technology platform. 
 As of March 31, 2017, our research and development staff consisted of 179 full-time employees. We expended $66.4 million, $49.8 million and $36.0 million on research and development in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our research and development expenditures include costs related to clinical trials, including ongoing clinical studies for our Impella devices. 
 Sales, Clinical Support, Marketing and Field Service 
 As of March 31, 2017, our worldwide sales, clinical support, marketing and field service teams included 398 full-time employees, 324 of whom are in the U.S. and Canada and 74 of whom are in Europe and Japan. In recent years, we have significantly increased the number of our direct sales and clinical support personnel in the U.S and Germany. 
 Our clinical support personnel consist primarily of registered nurses and other personnel with considerable experience in either the surgery suite or the cath lab, and they play a critical role in training customers in the use of our products. 
 International sales (sales outside the U.S., primarily in Europe) accounted for 9%, 8% and 10% of total revenue during fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Manufacturing 
 We manufacture our products in Danvers, Massachusetts and Aachen, Germany. Our Aachen facility performs final assembly and manufactures most of our disposable Impella devices, including the Impella 2.5, Impella 5.0, Impella LD, Impella CP and Impella RP devices. Our Danvers facility also manufactures the Impella CP device, certain Impella subsystems and accessories, including our Automated Impella Console, or AIC, our console for our Impella devices. In addition, we rely on third-party suppliers to provide us with components used in our existing products and products under development. For example, we outsource some of the manufacturing for components and circuit cards within our consoles. 
 We believe our existing manufacturing facilities give us the necessary physical capacity to produce sufficient quantities of products to meet anticipated demand for at least the next twelve months based on our current revenue forecast. We have recently expanded our manufacturing capacity in both our Aachen and Danvers facilities to support the growing demand for our Impella devices.  We expect to continue to expand our manufacturing capacity as we support expected growing demand for our Impella devices. Our U.S. and German manufacturing facilities are certified as being in compliance with standards established by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, and operate under the FDA’s good manufacturing practice requirements for medical devices set forth in the Quality System Regulation, or QSR. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We have developed significant know-how and proprietary technology, upon which our business depends. To protect our know-how and proprietary technology, we rely on trade secret laws, trademarks, patents, copyrights, and confidentiality agreements and other contracts. However, these methods afford only limited protection. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or technology, gain access to our trade secrets or disclose or use such secrets or technology without our approval. 
 6


A substantial portion of our intellectual property rights relating to the Impella devices and other products under development, such as the ECP pump, is in the form of trade secrets, rather than patents. We protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge in part through confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and other parties. We cannot assure you that our trade secrets will not become known to or be independently developed by our competitors. 
 We own or have rights to numerous U.S. and foreign patents. Our U.S. patents have expiration dates ranging from 2017 to 2035 and our foreign patents have expiration dates ranging from 2017 to 2033. We also own or have rights to certain pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. We believe patents will issue pursuant to such applications, but cannot guarantee it. Moreover, neither the timing of any issuance, the scope of protection, nor the actual issue date of these pending applications can be forecasted with precision. Where we have licensed patent rights from third parties, we are generally required to pay royalties. 
 Our patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. Our pending or future patent applications may not be issued. Others may hold or obtain patents that cover aspects or uses of our innovations. The patents of others may render our patents obsolete, limit our ability to patent or practice our innovations, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business. Because foreign patents may afford less protection than U.S. patents, they may not adequately protect our technology. 
 The medical device industry is characterized by a large number of patents and by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation. Our products and technologies could infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties. If third parties successfully assert infringement or other claims against us, we may not be able to sell our products or we may have to pay significant damages and ongoing royalties. In addition, patent or intellectual property disputes or litigation may be costly, result in product development delays, or divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. If any such disputes or litigation arise, we may seek to enter into a royalty or licensing arrangement. However, such an arrangement may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. We may decide, in the alternative, to litigate the claims or seek to design around the patented or otherwise protected proprietary technology, which may also be costly and time consuming. 
 The U.S. government may obtain certain rights to use or disclose technical data developed under government contracts that supported the development of some of our products. We retain the right to obtain patents on any inventions developed under those contracts, provided we follow prescribed procedures and are subject to a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to the U.S. government. 
 Competition 
 
Competition among providers of treatments for the failing heart is intense and subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards. We compete with companies that have substantially greater or broader financial, product development, sales and marketing resources and experience than we do. Furthermore, new product development and technological change characterize the areas in which we compete. Our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical as a result of technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies, including drug therapies. We must continue to develop and commercialize new products and technologies to remain competitive in the cardiovascular medical technology industry. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority supported by extensive data, and innovative features that enhance patient benefit, product performance, ease of use and reliability. Customer and clinical support, and data that demonstrate both improvement in a patient's quality of life and a product's cost-effectiveness are additional aspects of competition.
 
The cardiovascular segment of the medical technology industry is dynamic and subject to significant change due to cost-of-care considerations, regulatory reform, industry and customer consolidation, and evolving patient needs. The ability to provide products and technologies that demonstrate value and improve clinical outcomes is becoming increasingly important for medical technology manufacturers.
 
We are aware of other heart replacement device research efforts in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Japan. In addition, there are a number of companies; including Getinge (Maquet Cardiovascular), Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic, Edwards Lifesciences, CardiacAssist, Terumo Heart, Inc., Teleflex, Inc. and several early-stage companies, that are developing heart assist products, including implantable left ventricular assist devices and miniaturized rotary ventricular assist devices that directly and indirectly compete with our products.

Third-Party Reimbursement 
 Our products and services are generally purchased by healthcare institutions that rely on third-party payers to cover and reimburse the costs of related patient care. In the U.S., as well as in many foreign countries, government-funded or private insurance programs pay the cost of a significant portion of a patient’s medical expenses. No uniform policy of coverage or reimbursement for medical technology exists among all these payers. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payer to payer and by jurisdiction. 
 Third-party payers may include government healthcare programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, private insurers or managed care organizations. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, is responsible for administering the Medicare program in the U.S. and, along with its contractors, establishes coverage and reimbursement policies for the Medicare program. Medicare’s coverage and reimbursement policies are particularly significant to our business because a large percentage of the population for which our products are intended includes elderly individuals who are Medicare beneficiaries. In addition, private payers often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare. We cannot assure that government or private third-party payers will continue to cover and reimburse the procedures using our products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates for reimbursement will be adequate. 
 Medicare payment may be made, in appropriate cases, for procedures performed in the in-patient hospital setting using our technology. Medicare generally reimburses healthcare institutions in which the procedures are performed based upon prospectively determined amounts. For hospital in-patient stays, the prospective payment generally is determined by the patient’s condition and other patient data and procedures performed during the in-patient stay, using a classification system known as International Classification of Diseases, or ICD, and medical severity diagnosis-related groups, or MS DRGs. Prospective rates are adjusted for, among other things, regional differences, co-morbidity and complications. Hospitals performing in-patient procedures using our devices generally do not receive separate Medicare reimbursement for the specific costs of purchasing or implanting our products. Rather, reimbursement for these costs is bundled with the MS DRG-based payments made to hospitals for the procedures during which our devices are implanted, removed, repaired or replaced. Because prospective payments are based on predetermined rates and may be less than a hospital’s actual costs in furnishing care, hospitals have incentives to lower their in-patient operating costs by utilizing products, devices and supplies that will reduce the length of in-patient stays, decrease labor or otherwise lower their costs. 
 Coverage and reimbursements for procedures to implant, remove, replace or repair our products are generally established in the U.S. market. For instance, Medicare covers the use of LVADs when used for support of blood circulation post-cardiotomy, as a temporary life-support system until a human heart becomes available for transplant, or as destination therapy for patients who require permanent mechanical cardiac support, when the use is consistent with FDA approval and FDA-approved labeling instructions, as applicable. Coverage and reimbursements for procedures to implant the Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0, Impella LD and Impella RP devices are also established for in-hospital use by Medicare including ICD-10 for procedures and MS DRG coding. Actual coverage and payment may vary by local Medicare fiscal intermediary or third-party insurer. Our Impella devices are also covered by commercial and/or Medicare plans of many third-party insurers including Aetna, Humana, Cigna, HCSC Blue Cross Blue Shield, and United Healthcare. 
 In October 2016, the American Hospital Association (AHA) Coding Clinic publication confirmed MS-DRG 215, Heart Assist System Implant, for an Impella catheterization lab implant and ICU care. In addition to the October 2016 update, a recent AHA Coding Clinical publication in March 2017 added clarification of coding for implant of bi-ventricular Impella heart support along with the removal of the device provides hospital payment in MS-DRG 1 or 2 depending upon severity of illness. The Company’s Impella heart pumps  are now most commonly reimbursed under four MS-DRG categories including: 1) assistance in the catheterization lab only in MS-DRGs 216-221; 2) implant, assistance and removal after leaving the catheterization lab in MS-DRG 215; 3) right and left side heart support known as bi-ventricular and removal in MS-DRG 1-2, and; 4) hospitals receiving transferred patients with removal of the device in MS-DRG 268-269. In prior years, Impella was primarily reimbursed in only one category of MS-DRGs 216-221. The AHA and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have facilitated a system of care around the utilization of percutaneous heart pumps for the catheterization lab, ICU support, and transfer of patients to specialized centers. This progress also represents the expansion of Impella FDA indications for High Risk PCI, AMI Cardiogenic Shock, and bi-ventricular support.
 In April 2017, the CMS released a proposed set of hospital payment levels for patient discharges after October 1, 2017. The Proposed Rule for the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) is available on the CMS website at cms.gov and is open for public comment until June 13, 2017. Under the proposed rule, all discharges prior to October 1, 2017 are to remain under the current payment levels, and the final rulemaking is expected to be released in August 2017. The final rulemaking may differ substantially from this proposal. The text of the Proposed Rule did not include any changes to payment, coding or MS-DRG assignments for Impella, percutaneous heart assist, or related technology. However, data tables also released with the Proposed Rule include changes for all MS-DRGs which included a proposed reduction for MS-DRG 215 of 34.8%. The remaining MS-DRG categories have 
 8


proposed changes ranging from -7% to +3.5%. Even if the rule is finalized as proposed, all current MS-DRG rates will remain in place until October 2017.
 In addition to payments to hospitals for procedures using our technology, Medicare makes separate payments to physicians for their professional services when they perform surgeries to implant, remove, replace or repair our devices or when they perform percutaneous insertion and removal of Impella devices. Physicians generally bill for such services using a coding system known as Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes. Physician services performed in connection with the implantation, removal, replacement or repair of our approved products are billed using a variety of CPT codes. Generally, Medicare payment levels for physician services are based on the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and are revised annually by CMS. 
 In general, third-party reimbursement programs in the U.S. and abroad, whether government-funded or commercially insured, are developing a variety of increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs, including prospective reimbursement and capitation programs, group purchasing, reducing benefit coverage, requiring second opinions prior to major surgery, negotiating reductions to charges on patient bills, promoting healthier lifestyle initiatives and exploring more cost-effective methods of delivering healthcare. These types of cost-containment programs, as well as legislative or regulatory changes to reimbursement policies, could limit the amount which healthcare providers may be willing to pay for our medical devices. 
 Government Regulation and Other Matters
 
Our products and facilities are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA, European Community Notified Bodies, and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, to confirm compliance with the various laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and distribution of our products. We are also governed by federal, state, local, and international laws of general applicability, such as those regulating employee health and safety, and the protection of the environment. Overall, the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our business has increased over time.
United States Regulation

In the U.S., the FDA has responsibility for regulating medical devices under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA. The FDA regulates design, development, testing, clinical studies, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, import, export, sale promotion, and record keeping for medical devices, and reporting of adverse events, recalls, or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. Many of the devices that we develop, manufacture and market are in a category for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical investigation and pre-market clearance or approval requirements. The process of obtaining FDA clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive, lengthy, and costly. FDA review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products. A number of our products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales in various markets. Ultimately, the FDA may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other standards for clearance or approval. Additionally, even if a product is cleared or approved, the FDA may require postmarket testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized.
 
The FDA has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order the repair, replacement, or refund of the costs of such devices, or preclude the importation of devices that are or appear to be violative. The FDA also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the QSR concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and medical device reporting regulations, recall regulations, clinical testing regulations, and other requirements. The FDA may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards, or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval, and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. Additionally, the failure to comply with FDA or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines, delays, or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals, seizures, injunctions, recalls, refunds, civil money penalties, or criminal prosecution. Our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review. Moreover, the FDA and several other U.S. agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the U.S. and the import of devices into the U.S., which could also subject us to sanctions for noncompliance.
 
Premarket Regulation 
 In the U.S., the FDA strictly regulates medical devices under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and its regulations. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the statutory 
 9


framework described in the FFDCA. Class III devices are typically life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or new devices that have not been found to be substantially equivalent to legally marketed devices. Class III devices must generally receive PMA approval by the FDA before they may be marketed. 
 The PMA approval pathway requires that the applicant demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction, based on valid scientific evidence, that there is a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. During the PMA process, the FDA examines detailed data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the device. This information includes design, development, manufacture, labeling, advertising, preclinical testing and clinical study data. Prior to approving a PMA, the FDA may conduct an inspection of the manufacturing facilities and the clinical sites where supporting studies were conducted. The facility inspection evaluates the company’s compliance with the QSR. An inspection of clinical sites evaluates compliance with good clinical practice standards, including, for studies conducted under an investigational device exemption, or IDE, that the studies meet the requirements of FDA’s IDE regulations. Typically, the FDA wil
l convene an advisory panel meeting to review the data presented in the PMA. The panel’s recommendation is given substantial weight, but is not binding on the FDA. Under a set of performance measures that 
the FDA has committed to achieving in return for the receipt of user fees from manufacturers, FDA attempts 
to review all PMAs 
not requiring an advisory panel meeting within 180 “FDA days” and 
review of a PMA application that does require an advisory panel meeting within 320 “FDA days.” The term “FDA days” excludes the time the applicant spends responding to FDA requests for additional information
.  While the FDA has approved PMA applications within the allotted time period, reviews can occur over a significantly longer period. Upon completion of its review, FDA will either approve or deny the PMA. 
 If the FDA’s evaluation is favorable, the PMA is approved and the device may be marketed in the U.S. The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions such as post-market collection of clinical data. Failure
 to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the PMA approval. 
A PMA approval may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a device may be marketed. FDA 
interprets the FFDCA as prohibiting the promotion of approved medical devices for unapproved uses. After approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement is required in the event of a significant 
modification to the device, the device 
labeling, 
or the m
anufacturing process.  FDA can initiate proceedings to withdraw a PMA approval for failure to comply with regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial marketing.
 In March 2015, we received a PMA approval, from the FDA for use of the Impella 2.5 device in the U.S. during elective and urgent high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI, procedures. In December 2016, the FDA expanded this PMA approval in the U.S. to include the Impella CP device. With these PMA indications, the Impella 2.5 and Impella CP devices provide the only minimally invasive treatment options indicated for use during high-risk PCI procedures. In April 2016, the FDA approved a PMA supplement for our Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0 and Impella LD devices to provide treatment for ongoing cardiogenic shock, which occurs following heart attack or open heart surgery. The intent of the treatment is to reduce ventricular work and to provide the circulatory support necessary to allow heart recovery and early assessment of residual myocardial function.  We expect to make additional PMA supplement submissions for additional indications for use for our Impella devices in the future.
 When clinical trials of a device are required in order to obtain FDA approval, the sponsor of the trial is generally required to file an IDE application before commencing the trials. The FDA reviews and must approve an IDE before a clinical study may begin in the U.S. In addition, the clinical study must be approved by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site. The FDA, an IRB, or we may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including if information emerges suggesting that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. All clinical studies of investigational devices must be conducted in compliance with FDA requirements. Following the completion of a study, the data from the study must be collected, analyzed and presented in an appropriate submission to the FDA, either as a report submitted to the IDE file or in a marketing application such as a PMA. 
 In addition, certain medical devices can be approved by the FDA in the U.S. under an HDE rather than a PMA. In order for a device to be eligible for an HDE, there must be a qualifying target patient population of less than 8,000 patients per year for which there is no other comparable device available to treat the condition. In December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act increased the upper population limit for an HDE from 4,000 to 8,000. The FDA must agree that a device meets these criteria before it can be approved under an HDE. FDA approval of an HDE also requires demonstration that the device is safe for its intended application, that it is potentially effective, and that the probable benefits outweigh the associated risks. If another device receives approval through the PMA process that addresses the same patient population as the HDE device, the HDE device may need to be withdrawn from the U.S. market. An approved HDE authorizes sales of the device to any hospital after review and approval by the hospital’s IRB. Proposed modifications to approved HDE devices, like modifications to approved PMA devices, require FDA approval through a new HDE application or an HDE supplement. 
 In January 2015, we received FDA approval for the Impella RP heart pump under an HDE to provide circulatory assistance for up to 14 days in patients who develop acute right heart failure or decompensation after left ventricular assist device implantation, 
 10


myocardial infarction, heart transplant, or open-heart surgery. Impella RP is the first percutaneous single access heart pump designed for right heart support to receive FDA approval. As part of the HDE approval, we were required to conduct post approval studies for the Impella RP device. We have completed our Impella RP post-market studies and are currently working on a PMA application with the FDA to convert our HDE approval to a PMA approval.
 Postmarket Regulation 
 The medical devices that we manufacture and distribute pursuant to regulatory clearances or approvals by the FDA and other countries’ regulatory authorities are subject to continuing regulation by those agencies. The FDA reviews design, manufacturing, and distribution practices, labeling and record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experience and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. Among other FDA requirements, we must comply with the FDA’s g
ood manufacturing practice regulations for medical devices, known as QSR. These regulations govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, testing, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of
 all finished medical devices intended for human use. We must also comply with Medical Device Reporting, or MDR requirements, which require us to report to the FDA any incident in any of our products that may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, including medical intervention to prevent a death or serious injury, or in which any of our products malfunctioned and, if such malfunction were to recur, would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Labeling, advertising, and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. FDA’s enforcement policy prohibiting the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses. We are subject to routine inspection by the FDA for compliance with the QSR and MDR requirements, as well as other applicable regulations. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such devices, and require us to notify health professionals and others
 that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also seek a judicial injunction enjoining 
certain violations of the FFDCA and imposing operating restrictions and assess civil or criminal fines and penalties against our officers, employees, or us. The FDA may also recommend criminal prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Regulatory authorities outside the U.S. enforce similar laws and regulations within their respective jurisdictions.
 The FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce regulations prohibiting promotion of off-label uses and the promotion of products for which marketing clearance has not been obtained. If the FDA or another regulatory agency determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. Although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered off-label promotion of our products, the FDA or another regulatory agency could disagree and conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion. 
 On April 25, 2014, we received an administrative subpoena from the Boston regional office of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, Office of Inspector General requesting materials relating to our reimbursement of employee expenses and remuneration to healthcare providers from July 2012 through December 2012, in connection with a civil investigation under the False Claims Act (the “FCA Investigation”). Subsequently, we received Civil Investigative Demands from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts that collectively sought additional information relating to this matter for the time period of January 1, 2011 through September 14, 2016. We continue to cooperate fully with the government in this investigation and are exploring various ways to resolve this matter with the government. We are not able to predict what action, if any, might be taken in the future as a result of the investigation, or the potential impact to our financial position.
 The FDA can require post-market surveillance, or PMS, for significant risk devices, such as our medical devices, that require ongoing collection, analysis, and periodic submission to the FDA of clinical data during commercialization over a period of up to several years. The PMS data collection requirements are often burdensome and expensive. The failure to comply with the FDA’s regulations can result in enforcement action, including seizure of products, injunction, prosecution, civil fines and penalties, recall and/or suspension of FDA approval. 
 The FDA, in cooperation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, administers controls over the import and export of medical devices into and out of the U.S. International sales of our medical devices that have not received FDA approval are therefore subject to FDA export requirements. The CBP imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of medical devices, including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance. 
 
We are also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern our business operations, products, and technologies, including:
 11


 
• | federal, state, and foreign anti-kickback laws and regulations, which generally prohibit payments and other financial benefits to physicians or other purchasers of medical products as an inducement to purchase a product;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Stark law, which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare patients to a provider that bills this program for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician (or a member of the physician's immediate family) has a financial relationship with that provider, subject to numerous specific exemptions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal and state laws and regulations that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restrict the use and disclosure of such information, in particular, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or PPSA, which requires public disclosure of the financial relationships of United States physicians and teaching hospitals with applicable manufacturers, including medical device, pharmaceutical, and biologics companies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the False Claims Act, or FCA, which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally funded health care program, and health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any third-party payer; and may be enforced through whistleblower or ‘qui tam’ lawsuits filed by private individuals, and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which can be used to prosecute companies in the U.S. for arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties outside the U.S.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability, significant fines or penalties, negative publicity, and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation enforcement activities, and individual settlement agreements that impose a government monitor for a period of several years. To assist in our compliance efforts, we adhere to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding our sales and marketing activities in the United States and other countries in which we operate, including the ABIOMED code of Conduct and Compliance Policy. 
 
International Regulation

Internationally, the approval and regulation of medical devices is subject to a variety of laws and regulation. In Europe, our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements. Our Impella 2.5, Impella 5.0, Impella LD, Impella CP, Impella RP, and AIC are all approved under CE Mark and are available for sale in the European Union. The European Union requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed, maintained, and used in accordance with their intended purpose. National laws conforming to the European Union's legislation regulate our products under the medical devices regulatory system. Although the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated have been substantially replaced by the European Union Medical Devices Directive, individual nations can still impose unique requirements that may require supplemental submissions. The European Union medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the CE Mark. Manufacturers' quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body. In Europe, particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities. 
 In Japan, pre-market approval and clinical studies are required as is governmental pricing approval for medical devices. Clinical studies are subject to a stringent "Good Clinical Practices" standard. Approval time frames from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare vary from simple notifications to review periods of one or more years, depending on the complexity and risk level of the device. In addition, importation of medical devices into Japan is subject to the "Good Import Practices" regulations. As with any highly regulated market, significant changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect future sales.  In September 2016, we received PMDA approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour & Welfare for our Impella 2.5 and Impella 5.0 heart pumps to provide treatment of drug-resistant acute heart failure in Japan. We are preparing for the market launch in Japan, including working with Japanese government authorities to obtain reimbursement for these products.  
 
In many of the other foreign countries in which we market our products, we may be subject to regulations affecting, among other things:
 12


 
• | product standards and specifications;
--+--------------------------------------


• | packaging requirements;
--+------------------------


• | labeling requirements;
--+-----------------------


• | product collection and disposal requirements;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | quality system requirements;
--+-----------------------------


• | import restrictions;
--+---------------------


• | tariffs;
--+---------


• | duties; and
--+------------


• | tax requirements.
--+------------------

 
Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA. In some countries, the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing, which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs. In many countries, the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement.
 
Health Care Initiatives
 
Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews, technology assessments, and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the U.S., Europe, and Japan. As a result of these changes, the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical therapies. For example, government programs, private health care insurance, and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by restricting coverage and limiting the level of reimbursement for procedures or treatments, and some third-party payers require their pre-approval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients. These various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for our products and technologies.
 
The delivery of our products is subject to regulation by the HHS in the U.S. and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services. Foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services. Reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the U.S. government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by Medicare. CMS may also review whether and/or under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable for Medicare beneficiaries. Changes in current reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and our pricing flexibility.
 
Health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power, and this trend is expected to continue. The medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation, partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers. As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex, and tend to involve more long-term contracts than in the past. These larger customers, due to their enhanced purchasing power, may attempt to increase the pressure on product pricing.
 
Health Care Reform
 
In March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or together, the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”). The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, mandate that all individuals have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose increased taxes. Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a medical device excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013. We began paying the medical device excise tax in January 2013. 
 In December 2015, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (“PATH Act”) was implemented, which suspended the medical device excise tax implemented as part of the Affordable Care Act for a two-year period through December 31, 2017. The suspension has had a positive impact on our operating expenses for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, but is scheduled to resume beginning in January 2018. Additionally, the PATH Act permanently extended the research and development tax credit.
 
13


In December 2016, legislation was signed into law that, among other things, increases funding for medical research and eases the development and approval of experimental treatments. Known as the 21st Century Cures Act, the law also provides new funding for the National Institutes of Health and the FDA. A notable impact from this new law is an increase in the upper population limit for an HDE from 4,000 to 8,000. Although it will take some time to be fully implemented, the 21st Century Cures Act could help accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of medical advancements to ensure more timely access to new treatments and cures for patients in need.
 
Initiatives to repeal the ACA, in whole or in part, to delay elements of implementation or funding, and to offer amendments or supplements to modify its provisions have been persistent and have increased as a result of the 2016 election. The ultimate outcomes of legislative attempts to repeal or amend the ACA and legal challenges to the ACA are unknown. Results of recent Congressional elections and the change of presidential administrations beginning in 2017 have created a political environment in which substantial portions of the ACA could be repealed or revised.  HHS has delayed the implementation of regulations that would have placed at risk, based on health outcomes, portions of Medicare payment to hospitals, physicians, and related healthcare providers for certain cardiac procedures. On May 4, 2017, the United States House of Representatives voted to pass the American Health Care Act (and thereby repeal much of the ACA) by a narrow margin of 217 to 213, sending the bill to the Senate for deliberation. The Senate has indicated they will write their own version of the bill, instead of voting on the House version. It remains unclear what portions of the ACA may remain, or what any replacement or alternative programs may be created by any future legislation. 
 Other Regulations 
 We are also subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to such matters as safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use, handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research and development and manufacturing activities. Specifically, the manufacture of our biomaterials is subject to compliance with federal environmental regulations and by various state and local agencies. Although we believe we are in compliance with these laws and regulations in all material respects, we cannot provide assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with these and other laws or regulations in the future. 
Seasonality 
 Our quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors, including new product introductions, acquisitions, regulatory approvals, patient and physician holiday schedules, and other factors. Net sales in the first half of our fiscal year are typically lower than the second half of our fiscal year due to the seasonality of the U.S. and European markets, where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures. 
Employees 
 As of March 31, 2017, we had 908 full-time employees, including: 
  
• | 179 in product engineering, research and development, clinical development and regulatory;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 398 in sales, clinical support, marketing, field service and related support;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 247 in manufacturing; and
--+--------------------------


• | 84 in general and administration.
--+----------------------------------

 We routinely enter into contractual agreements with our employees, which typically include confidentiality and non-competition commitments. Our employees are not represented by unions. We consider our employee relations to be good. If we were unable to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future, our operations could be negatively impacted.
