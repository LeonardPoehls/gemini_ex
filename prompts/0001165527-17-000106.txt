Corporate History
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 20, 2006 under the name “Zebra Resources Incorporated” (aka “Zebra Resources Inc.”). At inception, we were an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties.
 
We are investigating several business opportunities to enhance shareholder value.
 
Effective March 17, 2010, we effected a one (1) old for two (2) new forward stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our authorized capital increased from 75,000,000 to 150,000,000 shares of common stock and our issued and outstanding increased from 32,000,000 shares of common stock to 64,000,000 shares of common stock, all with a par value of $0.001.
 
Also effective March 17, 2010, we changed our name from "Zebra Resources Incorporated" to "American Paramount Gold Corp.", by way of a merger with our wholly owned subsidiary American Paramount Gold Corp., which was formed solely for the change of name.
 
The name change and forward stock split became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening for trading on April 12, 2010 under the new stock symbol "APGA".
 
On April 22, 2010, we entered into a convertible loan agreement with Monaco Capital Inc., wherein Monaco Capital Inc. has agreed to loan our company up to $500,000. The loan (and accrued interest) is convertible in whole or in part into common shares of our company at a conversion price of $1.05 and will bear interest at 10% per annum. The principal amount of the loan and accrued interest is due and payable one year from the advancement date. We may at any time during the term of the loan prepay any sum up to the full amount of the loan and accrued interest then outstanding for an additional 10% of such amount. This agreement was subsequently cancelled and replaced with a new agreement on December 17, 2010. The new agreement provided for funding of up to $5,000,000, and any amounts advanced would bear interest at 10% per annum. In addition, any outstanding principal and accrued interest would be convertible at the volume weighted average trading price for the company’s shares of common stock for the ten-day trading period prior to any conversion. At August 31, 2014, $980,413 has been advanced.
 
On July 30, 2010, our directors approved the adoption of the 2010 Stock Option Plan (“2010 Plan”) which permits our company to issue up to 6,500,000 shares of our common stock to directors, officers, employees and consultants of our company upon the exercise of stock options granted under the 2010 Plan.
 
On October 6, 2010, we granted an aggregate of 5,400,000 stock options to ten individuals, including directors, officers, consultants and employees, pursuant to our 2010 Plan, at an exercise price of $0.68 per share. Of the 5,400,000 stock options, 400,000 options were exercisable until October 6, 2012 and 5,000,000 options were exercisable until October 6, 2015. All the stock options vested upon issuance. We issued the stock options to seven (7) non-U.S. persons (as that term is defined in Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933), in an offshore transaction relying on Regulation S and/or Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and to three (3) U.S. persons (as that term is defined in Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933) relying upon Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933.
 
On December 17, 2010, we entered into a convertible loan agreement with Monaco Capital Inc. This agreement replaces the convertible loan agreement entered into with Monaco Capital Inc. on April 22, 2010. The new agreement provided for funding of up to $5,000,000, and any amounts advanced would bear interest at 10% per annum. In addition, any outstanding principal and accrued interest would be convertible at the volume weighted average trading price for the company’s shares of common stock for the ten trading day period prior to any conversion.

On November 16, 2011, our company’s board of directors approved a forty (40) for one (1) reverse stock split of our authorized and issued and outstanding common shares.
 
On November 28, 2011, the Nevada Secretary of State accepted for filing a Certificate of Change, wherein we effected an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to decrease the authorized number of shares of our common stock from 150,000,000 to 3,750,000 shares of common stock, par value of $0.001. On November 29, 2011 the Nevada Secretary of State accepted for filing a Certificate of Correction, wherein we effected an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to correct the Certificate of Change filed on November 28, 2011 to state that no fractional shares shall be issued and that fractional shares shall be rounded up rather than rounded down.
 
The reverse split became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening of trading on January 26, 2012. Our new symbol is “APGA”. Our new CUSIP number is 02882T 204.
 
Our Current Business
 
We are an exploration stage mining company engaged in the identification, acquisition, and exploration of metals and minerals which until recently was focused on gold mineralization on our property located in Nevada. We intend to conduct exploration and development programs on our recently optioned property.
 
Since we are an exploration stage company, there is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral reserve exists on any of our current or future properties, To date, we do not know if an economically viable mineral reserve exists on our property and there is no assurance that we will discover one. Even if we do eventually discover a mineral reserve on our property, there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop our property into a producing mine and extract those resources. Both mineral exploration and development involve a high degree of risk and few properties which are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines.
 
Our operational focus has been to conduct exploration activities on the Cap Gold Project and to complete the terms of the Cap Gold option agreement. After completing drilling on our first hole, the Board determined to abandon the project entirely.
 
Subsidiaries
 
We do not have any subsidiaries.
 
Research and Development Expenditures
 
We have incurred $nil in research and development expenditures over the last two fiscal years.
 
Employees
 
Currently, with the exception of our directors and officers, we do not have any employees. Additionally, we have not entered into any consulting or employment agreements with our president, chief executive officer, treasurer, secretary or chief financial officer. Our directors, executive officers and certain contracted individuals play an important role in the running of our company. We do not expect any material changes in the number of employees over the next 12 month period. We do and will continue to outsource contract employment as needed.
