COMPANY HISTORY
 
Our Company
 
We are BlueFire Renewables, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”). Our goal is to develop, own and operate high-value carbohydrate-based transportation fuel plants, or bio-refineries, to produce ethanol, a viable alternative to fossil fuels, and to provide professional services to bio-refineries worldwide. Our bio-refineries will convert widely available, inexpensive, organic materials such as agricultural residues, high-content biomass crops, wood residues and cellulose from municipal solid wastes into ethanol. This versatility enables us to consider a wide variety of feedstocks and locations in which to develop facilities to become a low-cost producer of ethanol. We have licensed for use a patented process from Arkenol, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Arkenol”), to produce ethanol from cellulose (the “Arkenol Technology”). We are the exclusive North America licensee of the Arkenol Technology to produce ethanol and will evaluate purchasing a broader license for other products as opportunities arise. We may also utilize certain bio-refinery related rights, assets, work-product, intellectual property and other know-how related to 19 ethanol project opportunities originally developed by ARK Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Ark Energy”), to accelerate our deployment of the Arkenol Technology.
Company History
 
We are a Nevada corporation that was initially organized as Atlanta Technology Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, on October 12, 1993. The Company was re-named Docplus.net Corporation on December 31, 1998, and further re-named Sucre Agricultural Corp. (“Sucre”) and re-domiciled as a Nevada corporation on March 6, 2006. Finally, on May 24, 2006, in anticipation of the reverse merger by which it would acquire BlueFire Ethanol, Inc., a privately held Nevada corporation organized on March 28, 2006, as described below, the Company was re-named to BlueFire Ethanol Fuels, Inc.

On June 27, 2006, the Company completed a reverse merger (the “Reverse Merger”) with BlueFire Ethanol, Inc. (“BlueFire Ethanol”). At the time of Reverse Merger, the Company was a blank-check company and had no operations, revenues or liabilities. The only asset possessed by the Company was $690,000 in cash which continued to be owned by the Company at the time of the Reverse Merger. In connection with the Reverse Merger, the Company issued BlueFire Ethanol 17,000,000 shares of common stock, approximately 85% of all of the outstanding common stock of the Company, for all the issued and outstanding BlueFire Ethanol common stock. The Company stockholders retained 4,028,264 shares of Company common stock. As a result of the Reverse Merger, BlueFire Ethanol became our wholly-owned subsidiary. On June 21, 2006, prior to and in anticipation of the Reverse Merger, Sucre sold 3,000,000 shares of common stock to two related investors in a private offering of shares pursuant to Rule 504 for proceeds of $1,000,000.
 
On July 20, 2010, the Company changed its name to BlueFire Renewables, Inc. to more accurately reflect our primary business plan expanding the focus from just building cellulosic ethanol projects to include other advanced biofuels, biodiesel, and other drop-in biofuels as well as synthetic lubricants as opportunities arise.
 
The Company’s shares of common stock began trading under the symbol “BFRE.PK” on the Pink Sheets of the National Quotation Bureau on July 11, 2006 and later began trading on the OTCBB under the symbol “BFRE.OB” on June 19, 2007. Our shares of common stock are currently quoted on the OTCBB and the OTC Markets under the symbol “BFRE”. On April 3, 2017, the closing price of our Common Stock was $0.0016 per share.
 
Our executive offices are located at 25108 Marguerite Parkway Suite A-321, Mission Viejo, CA 92692 and our telephone number at such office is (949) 588-3767.
 
Principal Products or Services and Their Markets
 
Our goal is to develop, own and operate high-value carbohydrate-based transportation fuel plants, or bio-refineries, to produce ethanol and other biofuels that are viable alternatives to fossil fuels, and to provide professional services to bio-refineries worldwide. Our bio-refineries will convert widely available, inexpensive, organic materials such as agricultural residues, high-content biomass crops, wood residues and cellulose from municipal solid wastes into ethanol. This versatility enables us to consider a wide variety of feedstocks and locations in which to develop facilities to become a low-cost producer of ethanol.
 
We have licensed for use Arkenol Technology, a patented process from Arkenol to produce ethanol from cellulose for sale into the transportation fuel market. We are the exclusive North America licensee of Arkenol Technology.
 
Arkenol Technology
 
The production of chemicals by fermenting various sugars is a well-accepted science. Its use ranges from producing beverage alcohol and fuel-ethanol to making citric acid and xantham gum for food uses. However, the high price of sugar and the relatively low cost of competing petroleum based fuel has kept the production of chemicals mainly limited to producing ethanol from corn sugar.
 
In the Arkenol Technology process, incoming biomass feedstocks are cleaned and ground to reduce the particle size for the process equipment. The pretreated material is then dried to a moisture content consistent with the acid concentration requirements for breaking down the biomass, then hydrolyzed (degrading the chemical bonds of the cellulose) to produce hexose and pentose (C5 and C6) sugars at the high concentrations necessary for commercial fermentation. The insoluble materials are separated by filtering and pressing into a cake and further processed into fuel for other beneficial uses. The remaining acid-sugar solution is separated into its acid and sugar components. The separated sulfuric acid is recirculated and reconcentrated to the level required to break down the incoming biomass. The small quantity of acid left in the sugar solution is neutralized with lime to make hydrated gypsum which can be used as an agricultural soil conditioner. At this point the process has produced a clean stream of mixed sugars (both C6 and C5) for fermentation. In an ethanol production plant, naturally-occurring yeast, which Arkenol has specifically cultured by a proprietary method to ferment the mixed sugar stream, is mixed with nutrients and added to the sugar solution where it efficiently converts both the C6 and C5 sugars to fermentation beer (an ethanol, yeast and water mixture) and carbon dioxide. The yeast culture is separated from the fermentation beer by a centrifuge and returned to the fermentation tanks to be reused. Ethanol is separated from the now clear fermentation beer by conventional distillation technology, dehydrated to 200 proof and denatured with unleaded gasoline to produce the final fuel-grade ethanol product. The still bottoms, containing principally water and unfermented sugar, are returned to the process for economic water use and for further conversion of the sugars.

Simply put, the process separates the biomass into two main constituents: cellulose and hemicellulose (the main building blocks of plant life) and lignin (the “glue” that holds the building blocks together), converts the cellulose and hemicellulose to sugars, ferments them and purifies the fermentation liquids into ethanol and other end-products.
 
ARK Energy
 
BlueFire may also utilize certain bio-refinery related rights, assets, work-product, intellectual property and other know-how related to nineteen (19) ethanol project opportunities originally developed by ARK Energy to accelerate BlueFire’s deployment of the Arkenol Technology. These opportunities consist of ARK Energy’s previous relationships, analysis, site development, permitting experience and market research on various potential project locations within North America. ARK Energy has transferred these assets to us and we valued these business assets based on management’s best estimates as to their actual costs of development. In the event that we successfully finance the construction of a project that utilizes any of the transferred assets from ARK Energy, we are required to pay ARK Energy for the costs ARK Energy incurred in the development of the assets pertaining to that particular project or location. We did not incur the costs of a third-party valuation but based our valuation of the assets acquired by (i) an arms-length review of the value assigned by ARK Energy to the opportunities which are based on the actual costs it incurred in developing the project opportunities, and (ii) the anticipated financial benefits to us. The Company has not developed, paid for, or utilized any of these assets to date.
 
Pilot Plants
 
From 1994 through 2000, a test pilot bio-refinery plant was built and operated by Arkenol in Orange, California to test the effectiveness of the Arkenol Technology using several different types of raw materials containing cellulose. The types of materials tested included: rice straw, wheat straw, green waste, wood wastes, and municipal solid wastes. Various equipment used in the process was also tested and process conditions were verified leading to the issuance of certain patents in support of the Arkenol Technology. In 2002, using the results obtained from the Arkenol California test pilot plant, JGC Corporation, based in Japan, built and operated a bench scale facility followed by another test pilot bio-refinery plant in Izumi, Japan. At the Izumi plant, Arkenol retained the rights to the Arkenol Technology while the operations of the facility were controlled by JGC Corporation. Subsequent pilot facilities have been built by other third parties, including GS Caltex, a South Korean petroleum company, but Arkenol retains ownership of all the intellectual property.
 
Bio-Refinery Projects
 
We are currently in the development stage of building bio-refineries in North America. We plan to use the Arkenol Technology and utilize JGC’s operations knowledge from the Izumi test pilot plant to assist in the design and engineering of our facilities in North America. MECS and Brinderson Engineering, Inc. (“Brinderson”) provided the preliminary design package, while Brinderson completed the detailed engineering design for our originally planned Lancaster Bio-refinery. We feel this completed design should provide the blueprint for subsequent plant constructions. In 2010, MasTec in conjunction with Zachary Engineering completed the detailed engineering design for our planned Fulton Mississippi plant, also known as the Fulton Project (defined below).
 
We originally intended to build a facility that will process approximately 190 tons of green waste material per day to produce roughly 3.9 million gallons of ethanol annually (Lancaster Bio-refinery) and to build a facility that will process approximately 700 tons of green waste material per day to produce roughly 19 million gallons per year annually (Fulton). The Company has abandoned the Lancaster Project, and has sold the land originally intended for the Lancaster Project. The design can be used on future projects as capital and opportunities become available.

In 2009, BlueFire completed the engineering package for the Lancaster Bio-refinery, and finalized the Front-End Loading (“FEL”) 3 stage of engineering for the Lancaster Bio-refinery. In 2010, BlueFire continued to develop the engineering package for the Fulton Project, and completed FEL stages 2 and 3 of engineering for the Fulton Project readying the facility for construction. FEL is the process for conceptual development of processing industry projects. This process is used in the petrochemical, refining, and pharmaceutical industries. Front-End Loading is also referred to as Front-End Engineering Design (“FEED”). There are three stages in the FEL process:
 

FEL-1 | FEL-2 | FEL-3 
-----------------------+------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------
* Material Balance | * Preliminary Equipment Design | * Purchase Ready Major Equipment Specifications 
* Energy Balance | * Preliminary Layout | * Definitive Estimate 
* Project Charter | * Preliminary Schedule | * Project Execution Plan 
 | * Preliminary Estimate | * Preliminary 3D Model 
 | | * Electrical Equipment List 
 | | * Line List 
 | | * Instrument Index 

 
We estimated the total cost, including contingencies, to be in the range of approximately $100 million to $125 million for the Lancaster Bio-refinery. The cost approximations above do not reflect any fluctuations in raw materials or construction costs since the original pricing estimates, and will need to be “rebid” once a suitable opportunity is identified.
 
Since 2007, the Company has been developing a facility for construction, which had the United States Department of Energy's (“DOE”) financial support. This facility will be located in Fulton, Mississippi, and will use approximately 700 metric dry tons of woody biomass, mill residue, and other cellulosic waste to produce approximately 19 million gallons of ethanol annually (the “Fulton Project”). In 2007, we received an award from the DOE of up to $40 million for the Fulton Project. On or around October 4, 2007, we finalized our first award for a total approved budget of just under $10,000,000 with the DOE (“Award 1”). Award 1 was a 60%/40% cost share, whereby 40% of approved costs may be reimbursed by the DOE pursuant to the total $40 million award announced in February 2007. Award 1 was closed out on September 12, 2012. In December 4, 2009, the DOE announced that the award for this project has been increased to a maximum of $88 million under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) and the Energy Policy Act of 2005. On December 23, 2013, the Company received notice from the DOE indicating that the DOE would no longer provide funding under its second award due to the Company’s inability to provide agreements related to the balance of plant financing arrangements for the Fulton Project. On March 17, 2015, the Company received a letter from the DOE stating that because of the upcoming September 2015 expiration date for expending ARRA funding, it cannot reconsider its decision and the Company considers such decision to be final. The Company considers the DOE grant closed as of September 30, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, BlueFire has been reimbursed approximately $14,164,964 from the DOE under this award.
 
In 2010, BlueFire signed definitive agreements for the following three crucial contracts related to the Fulton Project: (a) feedstock supply with Cooper Marine and Timberlands Corporation (“Cooper Marine”), (b) off-take for the ethanol of the facility with Tenaska Biofuels LLC, now Tenaska Commodities LLC (“Tenaska”), and (c) the construction of the facility with MasTec North America Inc. (“MasTec”). Also in 2010, BlueFire continued to develop the engineering package for the Fulton Project, and had completed both the FEL-2 and FEL-3 stages of engineering readying the facility for construction. As of November 2010, the Fulton Project had all necessary permits for construction, and in that same month we began site clearing and preparation work, signaling the beginning of construction. In June 2011, BlueFire completed initial site preparation and the site was ready for facility construction. In February 2010, we announced that we applied for a $250 million dollar loan guarantee for the Fulton Project, under the DOE LGPO, mentioned above. In February 2011, BlueFire received notice from the DOE LGPO staff that the Fulton Project’s application will not move forward until the project raises the remaining equity necessary for the completion of funding. In August 2010, BlueFire applied for a $250 million loan guarantee with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) under Section 9003 of the 2008 Farm Bill, as defined below (“USDA LG”). Ultimately the USDA rejected the Company’s lender, BNP Paribas, for not meeting certain capital ratios. The Company has since abandoned pursuit of both loan guarantee opportunities but may reapply at a later date as funding opportunities arise.

In 2014, BlueFire signed an Engineering Procurement and Construction (“EPC”) contract with China Three Gorges Corporation, and its subsidiary China International Water & Electric, a large Chinese Engineering Procurement and Construction company. In tandem with the new EPC contractor, the company is engaging Chinese banks to provide the debt financing for the Fulton Project. BlueFire has received a letter of intent from the Export Import Bank of China to provide up to $270 million in debt financing for the Fulton Project. The letter of intent has since expired and BlueFire is actively seeking the remaining equity in order to reestablish the letter of intent or to find other banking entities capable of financing the Fulton Project. A commitment for the equity portion of the financing has been the major delay in the financing and the Company is focusing most of its efforts on finding suitable partners. No definitive agreements have been executed in regards to the Letter of Intent for financing.
 
In mid-2013, the Company began developing a new integration concept in regards to the Fulton project where a wood pellet facility would be integrated into the ethanol facility to provide a stronger financing package. A preliminary design package and due diligence have been completed. Since world pellet prices have fallen drastically the Company has stopped pursuing this option but can refocus on it if wood pellet prices become feasible again.
 
The Company has received notice from Tenaska Commodities, LLC, the off-take agreement provider for the Fulton Project, that due to the Company’s inability to construct the facility and provide first delivery of ethanol before December 31, 2016, Tenaska Commodities, LLC will terminate the market price contract on December 31, 2016. The Company has identified and received interest from other potential ethanol marketers and off-take companies and is actively seeking a replacement for this contract, but no definitive agreements have been made.
 
The Company is also researching and considering other suitable locations for other similar bio-refineries.
 
Status of Publicly Announced Products or Services
 
In February of 2012, SucreSource announced its first client, GS Caltex, a South Korean petroleum company. In the same month, it received the first payment under the Professional Services Agreement (“PSA”) for work on a facility in South Korea. As of December 31, 2014, SucreSource has completed and fulfilled all initial work and obligations under the fixed portion of the PSA. Anticipated future work product and additional services will be billed on an hourly basis when services are performed, as GS Caltex continues to develop additional facilities in South Korea.
Distribution Methods of Products or Services
 
We will utilize existing ethanol distribution channels to sell the ethanol that is produced from our plants. For example, we will enter into an agreement with an existing refiner or blender to purchase the ethanol and sell it into the Southern California and Mississippi transportation fuels market. Ethanol is currently mandated at a blend level of 10% nationwide which represents an approximately 26+ billion gallon per year market. We are also exploring the potential of onsite blending of E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline) and direct marketing to fueling stations. There are approximately 3,400 E85 fueling stations in the United States. As of the date of this filing, no ethanol is currently being produced or distributed.
Competition
 
According to the Renewable Fuels Association (“RFA”), most of the approximately 15.9 billion gallons of ethanol supply in the United States is derived from corn and, as of March 2017, is produced at approximately 215 facilities, ranging in size from 300 thousand to 300 million gallons per year, located predominately in the corn belt in the Midwest.
 
Traditional corn-based production techniques are mature and well entrenched in the marketplace, and the entire industry’s infrastructure is geared toward corn as the principal feedstock.
 
With the Arkenol Technology, the principle difference from traditional processes, apart from production technique, is the acquisition and choice of feedstock. The use of a non-commodity based, non-food related, biomass feedstock enables us to use feedstock typically destined for disposal, i.e. wood waste, yard trimmings and general green waste. All ethanol producers, regardless of production technique, will fall subject to market fluctuation in the end product, ethanol.

Due to the feedstock variety we process, we are able to locate production facilities in and around the markets where the ethanol will be consumed, thereby giving us a competitive advantage against much larger traditional producers who must locate plants near their feedstock, i.e. the corn belt in the Midwest, and ship the ethanol to the end market.
 
However, in the business of biomass-to-ethanol production, there are few companies, and very little to no commercial production infrastructure. As we continue to advance our biomass technology platform, we are likely to encounter competition for the same technologies from other companies that are also attempting to manufacture ethanol from cellulosic biomass feedstocks.
 
Ethanol production is also expanding internationally. Ethanol produced or processed in certain countries in Central America and the Caribbean region is eligible for tariff reduction or elimination upon importation to the United States under a program known as the Caribbean Basin Initiative. Large ethanol producers, such as Cargill, have expressed interest in building dehydration plants in participating Caribbean Basin countries, such as El Salvador, which would convert ethanol into fuel-grade ethanol for shipment to the United States. Ethanol imported from Caribbean Basin may be a less expensive alternative to domestically produced ethanol and may affect our ability to sell our ethanol profitably.
 
There are various biorefineries that have been supported by the DOE in different stages of development throughout the United States.
 
Industry Overview
 
On December 19, 2007, President Bush signed into law the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 the (“Energy Act of 2007”). The Energy Act of 2007 provides for an increase in the supply of alternative fuel sources by setting a mandatory Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS”) requiring fuel producers to use at least 36 billion gallons of biofuel by 2022, 16 billion gallons of which must come from cellulosic derived fuel. Additionally, the Energy Act of 2007 called for reducing U.S. demand for oil by setting a national fuel economy standard of 35 miles per gallon by 2020 – which will increase fuel economy standards by 40 percent and save billions of gallons of fuel.
 
In June 2008, the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008 (the “Farm Bill”) was signed into law. The 2008 Farm Bill also modified existing incentives, including ethanol tax credits and import duties and established a new integrated tax credit of $1.01/gallon for cellulosic biofuels.
 
On February 13, 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the “Recovery Act”) at the urging of President Obama, who signed it into law four days later, however, as of December 31, 2016, ARRA has expired.
 
Historically, producers and blenders had a choice of fuel additives to increase the oxygen content of fuels. MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether), a petroleum-based additive, was the most popular additive, accounting for up to 75% of the fuel oxygenate market. However, in the United States, ethanol is replacing MTBE as a common fuel additive. While both increase octane and reduce air pollution, MTBE is a presumed carcinogen which contaminates ground water. It has already been banned in California, New York, Illinois and 22 other states. Major oil companies have voluntarily abandoned MTBE and it is scheduled to be phased out under the Energy Policy Act. As MTBE is phased out, we expect demand for ethanol as a fuel additive and fuel extender to rise. A blend of 5.5% or more of ethanol, which does not contaminate ground water like MTBE, effectively complies with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requirements for reformulated gasoline, which is mandated in most urban areas.
 
Ethanol is a clean, high-octane, high-performance automotive fuel commonly blended in gasoline to extend supplies and reduce emissions. In 2015, according to the Alternative Fuels Data Center, 95% of all United States gasoline was blended with 10% ethanol. There is also growing federal government support for E85, which is a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline.
 
Ethanol is a renewable fuel produced by the fermentation of starches and sugars, such as those found in grains and other crops. Ethanol contains 35% oxygen by weight and when combined with gasoline, it acts as an oxygenate, artificially introducing oxygen into gasoline and raising oxygen concentration in the combustion mixture with air. As a result, the gasoline burns more completely and releases less unburnt hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and other harmful exhaust emissions into the atmosphere. The use of ethanol as an automotive fuel is commonly viewed as a way to reduce harmful automobile exhaust emissions. Ethanol can also be blended with regular unleaded gasoline as an octane booster to provide a mid-grade octane product which is commonly distributed as a premium unleaded gasoline.

Studies published by the Renewable Fuel Association indicate that approximately 13.8 billion gallons of ethanol were consumed in 2012 in the United States and every automobile manufacturer approves and warrants the use of E10. Because the ethanol molecule contains oxygen, it allows an automobile engine to more completely combust fuel, resulting in fewer emissions and improved performance. Fuel ethanol has an octane value of 113 compared to 87 for regular unleaded gasoline. Domestic ethanol consumption has tripled in the last eight years, and consumption increases in some foreign countries, such as Brazil, are even greater in recent years. For instance, 40% of the automobiles in Brazil operate on 100% ethanol, and others use a mixture of 22% ethanol and 78% gasoline. The European Union and Japan also encourage and mandate the increased use of ethanol.
 
For every barrel of ethanol produced, the American Coalition for Ethanol estimates that 1.2 barrels of petroleum are displaced at the refinery level, and that since 1978, U.S. ethanol production has replaced over 14.0 billion gallons of imported gasoline or crude oil. According to a Mississippi State University Department of Agricultural Economics Staff Report in August 2003, a 10% ethanol blend results in a 25% to 30% reduction in carbon monoxide emissions by making combustion more complete. The same 10% blend lowers carbon dioxide emissions by 6% to 10%.
 
During the last 20 years, ethanol production capacity in the United States has grown from minimal amounts to an estimated 15.5 billion gallons per year in 2016. In the United States, ethanol is primarily made from starch crops, principally from the starch fraction of corn. Consequently, the production plants are concentrated in the grain belt of the Midwest, principally in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota.
 
In the United States, there are two principal commercial applications for ethanol. The first is as an oxygenate additive to gasoline to comply with clean air regulations. The second is as a voluntary substitute for gasoline - this is a purely economic choice by gasoline retailers who may make higher margins on selling ethanol-blended gasoline, provided ethanol is available in the local market. The U.S. gasoline market is currently approximately 170 billion gallons annually, so the potential market for ethanol (assuming only a 10% blend) is 17 billion gallons per year. Increasingly, motor manufacturers are producing flexible fuel vehicles (particularly sports utility vehicle models) which can run off ethanol blends of up to 85% (known as E85) in order to obtain exemptions from fleet fuel economy quotas. There are now in excess of 5 million flexible fuel vehicles on the road in the United States and automakers will produce several million per year, offering further potential for significant growth in ethanol demand.
 
Cellulose to Ethanol Production
 
In a 2002 report titled “Outlook For Biomass Ethanol Production Demand,” the U.S. Energy Information Administration found that advancements in production technology of ethanol from cellulose could reduce costs and result in production increases of 40% to 160% by 2010. Biomass (cellulosic feedstocks) includes agricultural waste, woody fibrous materials, forestry residues, waste paper, municipal solid waste and most plant material. Like waste starches and sugars, they are often available for relatively low cost, or are even free. However, cellulosic feedstocks are more abundant, global and renewable in nature. These waste streams, which would otherwise be abandoned, land-filled or incinerated, exist in populated metropolitan areas where ethanol prices are higher. There has been no known update to this report.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
The DOE and USDA in its April 2005 report titled “BIOMASS AS FEEDSTOCK FOR A BIOENERGY AND BIOPRODUCTS INDUSTRY: THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF A BILLION-TON ANNUAL SUPPLY” found that about one billion tons of cellulosic materials from agricultural and forest residues are available to produce more than one-third of the current U.S. demand for transportation fuels. There has been no known update to this report.

Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
 
We have signed a definitive agreement with Tenaska for the off-take of our Fulton Project, which allows Tenaska to market all ethanol produced at this facility. This agreement has expired as of December 31, 2016. The Company is searching for a suitable replacement but no definitive agreements have been reached. See “DISTRIBUTION METHODS OF THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.”
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts
 
On March 1, 2006, we entered into a Technology License Agreement with Arkenol, for use of the Arkenol Technology. Arkenol holds the following patents in relation to the Arkenol Technology: 11 U.S. patents, 21 foreign patents, and one pending foreign patent. According to the terms of the agreement, we were granted an exclusive, non-transferable, North American license to use and to sub-license the Arkenol Technology. The Arkenol Technology, converts cellulose and waste materials into ethanol and other high value chemicals. As consideration for the grant of the license, we are required to make a onetime payment of $1,000,000 at first project funding or term of a licensee or sublicense project, and for each plant to make the following payments: (1) royalty payment of 3% of the gross sales price for sales by us or our sub-licensees of all products produced from the use of the Arkenol Technology, (2) and a onetime license fee of $40.00 per 1,000 gallons of production capacity per plant. Per the terms of the agreement, we made a onetime exclusivity fee prepayment of $30,000 during the period ended December 31, 2006. On March 9, 2009, we had paid Arkenol in full for the license. All sub-licenses issued by us will provide for payments to Arkenol of any other license fees and royalties due.
Governmental Approval
 
We are not subject to any government oversight for our current operations other than for corporate governance and taxes. However, the production facilities that we will be constructing will be subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the air, water and ground, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, and the health and safety of our employees. In addition, some of these laws and regulations will require our facilities to operate under permits that are subject to renewal or modification. These laws, regulations and permits can often require expensive pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment. A violation of these laws and regulations or permit conditions can result in substantial fines, natural resource damages, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns.
Governmental Regulation
 
Currently, the federal government encourages the use of ethanol as a component in oxygenated gasoline. This is a measure to both protect the environment, and, to utilize biofuels as a viable renewable domestic fuel to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil.
 
The ethanol industry is heavily dependent on several economic incentives to produce ethanol, including federal ethanol supports. Ethanol sales have been favorably affected by the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, particularly the Federal Oxygen Program which became effective November 1, 1992. The Federal Oxygen Program requires the sale of oxygenated motor fuels during the winter months in certain major metropolitan areas to reduce carbon monoxide pollution. Ethanol use has increased due to a second Clean Air Act program, the Reformulated Gasoline Program. This program became effective January 1, 1995, and requires the sale of reformulated gasoline in nine major urban areas to reduce pollutants, including those that contribute to ground level ozone, better known as smog. Increasingly stricter EPA regulations are expected to increase the number of metropolitan areas deemed in non-compliance with Clean Air Standards, which could increase the demand for ethanol.
 
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established a renewable fuel standard (“RFS”) to increase in the supply of alternative sources for automotive fuels. The RFS was expanded by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The RFS requires the blending of renewable fuels (including ethanol and biodiesel) in transportation fuel. Beginning in 2008, fuel suppliers must blend 9.0 billion gallons of renewable fuel into gasoline; this requirement increases annually to 36 billion gallons in 2022. The expanded RFS also specifically mandated the use of “advanced biofuels”—fuels produced from non-corn feedstocks and with 50% lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than petroleum fuel—starting in 2009. Of the 36 billion gallons required in 2022, at least 21 billion gallons must be advanced biofuel. There are also specific quotas for cellulosic biofuels and for biomass-based diesel fuel. On May 1, 2007, the EPA issued a final rule on the RFS program detailing compliance standards for fuel suppliers, as well as a system to trade renewable fuel credits between suppliers. Among other provisions, the RFS sets mandatory blend levels for renewable fuels while also establishing greenhouse gas (“GHG”) reduction criteria and a methodology for calculating lifecycle GHG emissions. While this program is not a direct subsidy for the construction of biofuels plants, the market created by the renewable fuel standard is expected to stimulate growth of the biofuels industry.

The Farm Bill and subsequent legislation provides for, among other things, grants for demonstration scale bio-refineries, and loan guarantees for commercial scale bio-refineries that produce advanced biofuels (i.e., any fuel that is not corn-based). Section 9003 includes a Loan Guarantee Program under which the U.S.D.A. could provide loan guarantees to fund development, construction, and retrofitting of commercial-scale refineries.
 
Research and Development Activities
 
Research and development costs for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, were approximately $288,000 and $609,000, respectively.
 
To date, project development costs include the research and development expenses related to our future cellulose-to-ethanol production facilities including site development, and engineering activities.
 
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
We will be subject to extensive air, water and other environmental regulations and we will have to obtain a number of environmental permits to construct and operate our plants, including, air pollution construction permits, a pollutant discharge elimination system general permit, storm water discharge permits, a water withdrawal permit, and an alcohol fuel producer’s permit. In addition, we may have to complete spill prevention control and countermeasure plans.
 
The production facilities that we will build are subject to oversight activities by the federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. There is always a risk that the federal agencies may enforce certain rules and regulations differently than state environmental administrators. State or federal rules are subject to change, and any such changes could result in greater regulatory burdens on plant operations. We could also be subject to environmental or nuisance claims from adjacent property owners or residents in the area arising from possible foul smells or other air or water discharges from the plant.
 
Employees
 
We have 2 full-time employees as of December 31, 2016, and 2 part-time employees.
 
On December 31, 2016, Ms. Necitas Sumait, a senior vice-president and Board member, resigned as an executive of the Company and as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. The resignation is not the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices.
 
None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
