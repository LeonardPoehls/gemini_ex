Item 1. Business.
 
OurPet’s Company (“OurPet’s” or the “Company”) is a Colorado corporation incorporated in 1998 that operates out of Fairport Harbor, Ohio. The Company markets proprietary products to the retail pet business under the OurPet’s® and PetZone® brands. In January 2006, OurPet’s purchased substantially all the assets of PetZone, a competitor that manufactured and distributed cat, dog and bird feeders, storage bins, and cat and dog toys to the Pet Specialty, Mass retailers and grocery chains. In July 2010, OurPet’s purchased substantially all the assets of Cosmic Pet Products, a leading provider of catnip products, cat toys, and other cat products such as scratchers and cat treats. In April 2015, OurPet’s purchased seven bowl/feeder products, including the molds, from Molor Products. In December 2016, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary named Series OP to self-insure against certain business losses. Also in December 2016, the Company formed another wholly owned subsidiary, OurPet’s DISC, Inc. (“DISC”), an Ohio corporation, which has elected to be a Domestic International Sales Corporation (DISC) under U.S. tax law. A commission is paid by OurPet’s to DISC for sales of manufactured products of at least 51% U.S. content being sold to countries outside the United States.
 
We develop and market products for improving the health, safety, comfort, and enjoyment of pets. Our mission is “to exceed pet and pet parent expectations with innovative solutions.” Our dual brand strategy is focused on OurPets® for the Pet Specialty channel and PetZone® for the Food, Drug and Mass retail channel. The products sold have increased from the initial Big Dog Feeder® to approximately 1,000 products for dogs, cats, and birds. Products are marketed under the OurPet’s®, PetZone®, Flappy®, SmartScoop®, Ecopure Naturals®, Play-N-Squeak®, Durapet®, Clipnosis®, Go! Cat! Go!®, Festiva®, and Cosmic Pet™ labels to customers, both domestic and foreign. The manufacturing of these products is subcontracted to other entities, both domestic and foreign, based upon price, delivery, and quality.
 
Packaged Facts, a leading publisher in the United States of market studies on consumer products, recently published its report of the “U.S. Pet Market Outlook, 2017-2018.” It estimates the overall pet products and services market totaled $81.43 billion in 2016. The report expects the industry to exceed the $100 billion mark in 2021. The pet supplies segment (OurPet’s segment) was the third-largest segment in 2016 with $16.45 billion in revenue. This segment showed an increase of 7.5% from the previous year. U.S. retail channel sales of pet products, which includes pet food and pet supplies, were estimated at $47.8 billion in 2016, up 5.4% over 2015 (U.S. Pet Market Outlook, 2017-2018).
 
Packaged Facts cites higher income households as crucial to the success of the pet industry. It also identifies the human/animal bond, humanization of pets, and health and wellness as key drivers. As it explains in its outlook study, “Humanization of pets is a natural expression of the ‘pets as family’ trend, whereby pet owners treat their pets like children and are highly receptive to products they use for themselves…. The phenomenon seeps into marketing messages, corporate philosophies, acquisition strategy, packaging and product attributes” (U.S. Pet Market Outlook, 2017-2018).

The companies listed above are intended to serve as examples only. As a standard industry practice, price lists are provided to distributors, who in turn place products with retailers. Larger retailers with a national presence will generally order product directly from us pursuant to the price list and subject to negotiated additional terms, if any. With the exception of a written price list, many of the arrangements with retailers or distributors are verbal. As such, written contracts often do not exist. Customers submit their own standard purchase orders based on our current price list. Even the larger retailers, which might have written contracts with us, are under no obligation to purchase specific product from us. While all of the above companies may currently buy product from OurPet’s, none of these customers are under any contractual obligation to purchase a specific volume of product or to continue making any purchases in the future. We currently have approximately 200 customers to whom we sell products, with the total number and specific customers changing from time to time. With the exceptions of Wal-Mart and this year Amazon.com, none of our customers account for 10.0% or more of our sales. For the year ended December 31, 2017, $6,218,810 (22.0%) of our revenue was derived from Wal-Mart and $2,862,669 (10.1%) derived from Amazon.com. For more information, see our Consolidated Financial Statements, notes, and tables included in this Form 10-K.
 
We currently market products, such as: dog, cat, and bird feeders; dog and cat toys; cat and dog waste management products; catnip products and pet supplements such as Joint Kare. We conduct our marketing and sales activities through 15 employees and 20 independent sales representatives’ organizations. Domestic independent sales representatives are paid commissions, which range from 2% to 10% of net sales to customers.
 
Our marketing strategies include, among others: trade shows; customer visits; social media; telemarketing; direct mail; As Seen on TV programs, trade journal advertising; product sampling programs; and customer support programs, such as advertising and promotional allowances.
 
We are one of many companies in the accessory and consumable pet products market with no measurable percentage of that market. Our competition in the healthy feeding systems, interactive toys, and healthy consumable products markets are both domestic and foreign companies, many of whom manufacture their products in low cost areas such as India, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Mexico.
 
Most of our products are proprietary and we have been granted or assigned 98 United States and international patents and have 59 United States and international patents pending for cat and dog toys, dog feeders, and waste management products. We registered trademarks for “The OurPet’s Company” as our corporate identity, and “OurPets” as our pet specialty brand as well as PetZone® for the Food, Drug and Mass retail channel. To protect our trade names we obtained 71 trademark registrations and applied for 5 trademark registrations, which are still pending.
 
As of March 21, 2017, we had a total of 50 employees, 48 of which are full time employees. These employees consist of: 3 officers; 15 employees in sales and marketing; 1 employee in business & product development; 4 employees (not including 2 officers) in finance and administration; 6 employees (not including 1 officer) in operations; and 21 employees (2 of them part time) in production, warehousing and shipping, at our Fairport Harbor, Ohio and Mentor, Ohio facilities. Most of our manufacturing is subcontracted to outside vendors. However, we do perform some light manufacturing at our Mentor, Ohio facility for the production of catnip and tuna consumable products. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and believe we have good relations with our employees.
 
The Company contracts with a Professional Employer Organization (PEO) which co-employs the company’s employees.  The PEO and the Company share and allocate responsibilities and liabilities.  The PEO assumes much of the responsibility and liability for the business of employment such as risk management, human resources (HR) management, benefits administration, workers compensation, payroll and payroll tax compliance.  The Company retains the responsibility for hiring, firing and managing its employees and operations.   The purpose of the Company’s contracting with a PEO was to strengthen the Company’s HR functions and provide its employees with a wider range of benefits at more affordable prices.
