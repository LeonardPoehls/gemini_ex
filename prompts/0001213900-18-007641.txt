Current Business of the Company.
 
The current business of the Company is a media holding company, which looks for investment opportunities in radio, television, movie production and television productions to be used on online Cloud television and radio.
 
Currently, the Company is involved in pre-production of two full-length movies; developing a weekly half hour television show; and producing radio talk show with LeadingEdgeRadio.com.
 
We have redirected our efforts toward the cloud television market and have launched two cloud television networks, World Drone Recreation Aviators (wdra.tv and wdra.club) and Leading Edge Radio Network (leadingedgeradio.tv). Each network develops its own channel(s) content and works with the Company to ensure that their viewers receive it. We continue development of our online movie channel which will feature video on demand and a 24 hour a day streaming internet TV station providing limited free content and a subscriber based business model along with potential revenue generating video on demand programming. The online news and video news bureau in association with Leading Edge Radio Network is advancing on schedule and completion is expected by year-end. Leading Edge Radio TV continues developing a venue for new and experienced radio and TV broadcasters to host their own programs via Internet TV and radio through Mancuso Martin Productions. Leading Edge Radio Network and Mancuso Martin Productions continue strategic partnership opportunities involving radio, Internet TV and movies with the Company. We have also entered into discussions with Mancuso Martin Productions for screenplay properties through its production division that include seven screenplays featuring suspense thrillers, horror, comedy, romance and sports themed movies.
 
We have also entered into preliminary discussions for the creation of a professional line of golf balls and golf equipment in order to facilitate long term objectives of the design of a professional line of golf balls, gloves, golf shoes and apparel which will be sold direct to consumer through a proprietary marketing program, eliminating the need for brick and mortar retailing and keeping the Company overhead low.
 
At the present time, the Company has one employee, who consists of the chief executive officer and a number of consultants retained to advise the Companies on changes in our target markets.
 
We have no revenues, we have incurred losses since inception and we have relied upon loans and the sale of our securities to fund operations. Assuming funding is available, we plan to develop, produce and market properties related to our core business strategy. We may interest other companies in our properties to either participate by means of joint venture agreements in the development of our properties or to finance and establish production of movie, television and entertainment product.
