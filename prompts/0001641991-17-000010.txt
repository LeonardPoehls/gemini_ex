FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Some of the statements in this document and any documents incorporated by reference, including any statements as to operational and financial projections, constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our businesses’ or our industries’ actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Such statements may address our plans, our strategies, our prospects, or changes and trends in our business and the markets in which we operate under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) or in other sections of this document. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “project,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of those terms or similar expressions. Particular risks facing us include business, internal operations, legal and regulatory risks, costs of raw materials, pricing pressures, pension funding requirements and changes in the economy.  These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially because of market conditions in our industries or other factors, and forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. In addition, management’s estimates of future operating results are based on our current complement of businesses, which is subject to change as management selects strategic markets.
All the forward-looking statements in this document are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” and in any documents incorporated by reference herein that describe risks and factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We caution you that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment and frequently enter into new businesses and product lines. We cannot predict these new risk factors, and we cannot assess the impact, if any, of these new risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. We undertake no obligation to update or publicly revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this document.
BUSINESS
Our Business
SPX FLOW, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (“SPX FLOW,” ‘‘the Company,’’ “we,” “us,” or “our”) operate in three business segments and were wholly-owned by SPX Corporation (the “former Parent”) until September 26, 2015, at which time the former Parent distributed 100% of our outstanding common stock to its shareholders through a tax-free spin-off transaction (the “Spin-Off”). Since that time we have been an independent, publicly-traded company on the NYSE under the ticker symbol FLOW.
We are a global supplier of highly specialized, engineered solutions with operations in over 30 countries and sales in over 150 countries around the world. Our solutions play a role in helping to meet the global demand in the end markets we serve. Our total revenue in 2016 was $2.0 billion, with approximately 39%, 35%, and 26% from sales into the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific regions, respectively.
We serve the food and beverage, power and energy and industrial markets. Our product portfolio of pumps, valves, mixers, filters, air dryers, hydraulic tools, homogenizers, separators and heat exchangers, along with the related aftermarket parts and services, supports global industries, including food and beverage, oil and gas, power generation (including nuclear and conventional), chemical processing, compressed air and mining. From an end market perspective, in 2016, approximately 37% of our revenues were from sales into the food and beverage end markets, approximately 28% were from sales into the power and energy end markets, and approximately 35% were from sales into the industrial end markets. Our core strengths include product breadth, global capabilities and the ability to create custom-engineered solutions for diverse flow processes.

Over the past several years, we have strategically expanded our scale, relevance to customers, and global capabilities. We believe there are attractive opportunities to continue to expand our business.
Following our Spin-Off from the former Parent, we are aggressively executing a multi-year plan to transition our enterprise to an operating company. As part of this plan, we announced our intent to further optimize our global footprint, streamline business processes and reduce selling, general and administrative expense through a global realignment program. The realignment program is intended to reduce costs across operating sites and corporate and global functions, in part by making structural changes and process enhancements which allow us to operate more efficiently. We have made significant progress reducing our cost structure through 2016, realigning our footprint and streamlining our functional support globally. 
We have aligned our segment teams to focus primarily on developing intimate customer relationships and expanding our relevance to customers within each end market. The key areas our end market teams are emphasizing include (i) product management, (ii) channel development, (iii) engineering customer solutions and (iv) project execution and delivery. We made substantial progress in certain of these areas during 2016 and have plans to further streamline support functions to simplify and reduce our cost structure. Our ultimate goal is to create a more customer-centric, service-oriented organization and deliver greater value to our customers, investors and employees.
REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
Our business is organized into three reportable segments — Food and Beverage, Power and Energy and Industrial. The following summary describes the products and services offered by each of our reportable segments:
Food and Beverage:  Our Food and Beverage reportable segment had revenues of $728.3, $869.8, and $965.3 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and backlog of $295.7 and $321.3 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Approximately 91% of the segment's backlog as of December 31, 2016 is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2017.

Acquisitions
We did not acquire any businesses in 2016. As part of our long-term strategy, we plan to evaluate potential acquisitions that (a) are complementary to our existing products and services, (b) increase our relevance to customers and our capabilities to serve them, (c) expand our global capabilities and accelerate our localization strategy and (d) expand our end market reach.
International Operations
We are a multinational corporation with operations in over 30 countries. Sales outside the United States were $1,298.8, $1,552.0 and $1,835.7 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
See Note 4 to our consolidated and combined financial statements for more information on our international operations. 
Research and Development
We are actively engaged in research and development programs designed to improve existing products and manufacturing methods and to develop new products to better serve our current and future customers. We place particular emphasis on the development of new products that are compatible with, and build upon, our manufacturing and marketing capabilities. We expensed $19.4, $19.1 and $19.8 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of research activities relating to the development and improvement of our products. 
Intellectual Property
We own approximately 160 domestic and 260 foreign patents, including 35 patents that were issued in 2016, covering a variety of our products and manufacturing methods. We also own a number of registered trademarks. Although in the aggregate our patents and trademarks are of considerable importance in the operation of our business, we do not consider any single patent or trademark to be of such importance that its absence would adversely affect our ability to conduct business as presently constituted. We are both a licensor and licensee of patents. For more information, please refer to "Risk Factors." 
Raw Materials
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, including steel, titanium, copper, nickel and petroleum-based products. Where appropriate, we may enter into long-term supply arrangements or fixed-cost contracts to lower the overall cost of raw materials. In addition, due to our diverse product and service offering, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our production facilities, we use numerous sources for the raw materials needed in our operations. However, we are not dependent on any one supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Lastly, we continue to centralize certain aspects of supply chain management in an effort to ensure adequate materials are available for production at low cost.
Competition
The markets we serve are highly competitive and fragmented. Our competitors are diverse, ranging from large multi-nationals to regional and local companies. Our principal global competitors include Alfa Laval AB, Flowserve Corporation, GEA Group AG, IDEX Corporation, ITT Goulds Pumps, Sulzer Ltd., and Tetra Pak International S.A. We do not have any one competitor with all the same product offerings, nor do we have any one competitor which serves all the same end markets. 
Our ability to compete effectively depends on a variety of factors including breadth of product offering, product quality, engineering strength, brand reputation, lead times, global capabilities, service capabilities, and cost. As many of our products are sold through distributors and independent representatives, our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel network. 
Environmental Matters
See "MD&A — Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates — Contingent Liabilities," "Risk Factors" and Note 13 to our consolidated and combined financial statements for information regarding environmental matters. 
Employment 
As of December 31, 2016, we had over 7,000 employees. Less than 1% of our U.S. employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements, while certain of our non-U.S. employee groups are covered by various collective labor 
3

arrangements. While we generally have experienced satisfactory labor relations, we are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes. 
Executive Officers 
See Part III, Item 10 of this report for information about our executive officers. 
Other Matters 
No customer or group of customers that, to our knowledge, are under common control, accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated and combined revenues for any period presented. 
Our businesses maintain sufficient levels of working capital to support customer requirements, particularly inventory. We believe our businesses' sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors. 
The results of many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets they serve. In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations. In aggregate, our businesses tend to be stronger in the second half of the calendar year. Additionally, timing of revenue recognition on large Food and Beverage systems projects, Power and Energy projects and large Industrial orders may cause significant fluctuations in financial performance from period to period.
