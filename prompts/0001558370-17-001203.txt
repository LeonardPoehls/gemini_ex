     ITEM 1.             BUSINESS
     Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this Form 10-K to “we,” “our,” “us,” “our company” and “the Company” refer to QTS Realty Trust, Inc. (“QTS”), a Maryland corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including QualityTech, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to in this Form 10-K as the “Operating Partnership” or “predecessor.”     Overview 
     We are a leading provider of secure, compliant data center solutions, hybrid cloud and fully managed services. We refer to our spectrum of core data center products as our “3Cs,” which consist of Custom Data Center (“C1”), Colocation (“C2”) and Cloud and Managed Services (“C3”).  Our 3C integrated technology platform provides flexible, scalable, secure IT solutions for web and IT applications. Our Critical Facilities Management (“CFM”) provides increased efficiency and greater performance for third-party data center owners and operators.  
     We operate a portfolio of 25 data centers located throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Within the United States, we are located in some of the top U.S. data center markets plus other high-growth markets. Our data centers are highly specialized, full-service, mission-critical facilities used by our customers to house, power and cool the networking equipment and computer systems that support their most critical business processes. We believe that our data centers are best-in-class and engineered to adhere to the highest specifications commercially available to customers, providing fully redundant, high-density power and cooling sufficient to meet the needs of major national and international companies and organizations. This is in part reflected by our operating track record of “five-nines” (99.999%) reliability and by our diverse customer base of more than 1,100 customers, including financial institutions, healthcare companies, government agencies, communications service providers, software companies and global Internet companies. 
     QTS is a Maryland corporation formed on May 17, 2013 and is the sole general partner and majority owner of QualityTech, LP, our operating partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). Substantially all of our assets are held by, and our operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership. QTS’ Class A common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “QTS.”
     The Operating Partnership is a Delaware limited partnership formed on August 5, 2009 and was QTS’ historical predecessor prior to QTS’s initial public offering on October 15, 2015 (the “IPO”), having operated the Company’s business until the IPO. As of December 31, 2016, QTS owned an approximate 87.6% ownership interest in the Operating Partnership. 
     We believe that QTS has operated and has been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Our qualification as a REIT, and maintenance of such qualification, depends upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distributions to our stockholders and the concentration of ownership of our equity shares.
     Our Portfolio
     We develop and operate 25 data centers located throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, containing an aggregate of approximately 5.7 million gross square feet of space (approximately 91.9% of which is wholly owned by us), including approximately 2.5 million “basis-of-design” raised floor square feet, which represents the total data center raised floor potential of our existing data center facilities. This represents the maximum amount of space in our existing buildings that could be leased following full build-out, depending on the configuration that we deploy. We build out our data center facilities for both general use (colocation) and for executed leases that require significant amounts of space and power, depending on the needs of each facility at that time.  As of December 31, 2016, this space included approximately 1,346,000 raised floor operating net rentable square feet, or NRSF, plus approximately 1.2 million square feet of additional raised floor in our development pipeline, of which approximately 151,000 NRSF is expected to become operational by December 31, 2017. Of the total 1.2 million NRSF in our

development pipeline, none was related to customer leases which had been executed as of December 31, 2016 but not yet commenced. Our facilities collectively have access to over 650 megawatts (“MW”) of gross utility power with 600 MW of available utility power. We believe such access to power gives us a competitive advantage in redeveloping data center space, since access to power is usually the most limiting and expensive component in data center redevelopment. At the data centers located on each of our properties, whether owned or leased by us, we provide full-service facilities used by our customers to house, power and cool the networking equipment and computer systems that support many of their most critical business processes, as well as additional services.
     We account for the operations of all of our properties in one reporting segment. 
     Our Customer Base 
     We provide data center solutions to a diverse set of customers. Our customer base is comprised of companies of all sizes representing an array of industries, each with unique and varied business models and needs. We serve Fortune 1000 companies as well as small and medium businesses (“SMBs”) including financial institutions, healthcare companies, government agencies, communications service providers, software companies and global Internet companies. 
     Our Custom Data Center, or C1, customers typically are large enterprises with significant IT expertise and specific IT requirements, including financial institutions, “Big Four” accounting firms and the world’s largest global Internet companies, with our median customer utilizing approximately 4,600 square feet. Our Colocation, or C2, customers consist of a wide range of organizations, including major healthcare, telecommunications and software and web-based companies. Our C3 Cloud customers include both large organizations and SMBs seeking to reduce their capital expenditures and outsource their IT infrastructure on a flexible basis. Examples of current C3 Cloud customers include a global financial processing company and various U.S. government agencies. 
     As a result of our diverse customer base, customer concentration in our portfolio is limited. As of December 31, 2016, only three of our more than 1,100 customers individually accounted for more than 3% of our monthly recurring revenue (“MRR”) (as defined below), with only one greater than 4% which accounted for approximately 13% of our MRR. In addition, approximately 60% of our MRR was attributable to customers who use more than one of our 3Cs products.
     Our customer base resides in both domestic and international locations, with MRR from U.S. locations representing $30.3 million and $26.5 million of MRR as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and MRR from our international locations representing $0.6 million and $1.0 million of MRR as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. All our revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014 were attributable to U.S. locations. 
     Our Structure 
     Substantially all of our assets are held by, and our operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership. Our interest in the Operating Partnership entitles us to share in cash distributions from, and in the profits and losses of, the Operating Partnership in proportion to our percentage ownership. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, we generally have the exclusive power under the partnership agreement to manage and conduct the Operating Partnership’s business and affairs.

 The following diagram depicts our ownership structure, on a non-diluted basis as of December 31, 2016.
    
     Our Competitive Strengths
     We believe that we are uniquely positioned in the data center industry and distinguish ourselves from other data center providers through the following competitive strengths: 
    
· | Fully Integrated Platform Offers Scalability and Flexibility to Our Customers and Us. Our differentiated, fully integrated 3Cs approach, allows us to serve a wide variety of customers in a large, addressable market and to scale to the level of IT infrastructure outsourcing desired by our customers. We believe customers will continue to have evolving and diverse IT needs and will prefer providers that offer a portfolio of IT solutions. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 60% of our MRR was attributable to customers who use more than one of our 3Cs products. We believe our ability to offer a full spectrum of 3Cs product offerings enhances our leasing velocity, allows for an individualized pricing mix, results in more balanced lease terms and optimizes cash flows from our assets. We leverage our integrated product mix to offer Critical Facilities Management (“CFM”), the operation of customer-owned data centers, with the combination of real estate ownership and technology services that supports a true enterprise partnership.

· | Platform Anchored by Strategically Located, Owned “Mega” Data Centers. Our larger “mega” data centers, Atlanta-Metro, Irving, Richmond, Atlanta-Suwanee, Princeton, Piscataway and Chicago, allow us to deliver our fully integrated platform and 3Cs products by building and leasing space more efficiently than in single-

use or smaller data centers. We believe that our data centers are engineered to among the highest specifications commercially available. Our international portfolio of 25 data centers (10 of which are wholly owned, representing 88.1% of our raised square feet, and another is subject to a long-term ground lease), includes 21 data centers that are strategically located throughout the United States. We also own an aggregate of 276.4 acres of additional land adjacent to data center properties that can support the development of up to an additional approximately 2.8 million square feet of raised floor.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Significant Expansion Opportunity within Existing Data Center Facilities at Lower Costs. We have developed substantial expertise in redeveloping facilities through the acquisition and redevelopment of our operating facilities. Our data center redevelopment model is primarily focused on redeveloping space within our current facilities, which allows us to build additional leasable raised floor at a lower incremental cost compared to ground-up development and to rapidly scale our redevelopment in a modular manner to coincide with customer demand and our estimates of optimal product utilization among our C1, C2 and C3 products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Diversified, High-Quality Customer Base. We have significantly grown our customer base from 510 in 2009 to over 1,100 as of December 31, 2016, with our largest customer accounting for approximately 13% of our MRR. No other customers exceeded 4% of our MRR. Our focus on our customers and our ability to scale with their needs allows us to achieve a low rental churn rate (which is the MRR lost in the period to a customer intending to fully exit our platform in the near term compared to the total MRR at the beginning of the period). For the year ended December 31, 2016, we experienced a rental churn rate of 5.6%.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Robust In-House Sales Capabilities. Our in-house sales force has deep knowledge of our customers’ businesses and IT infrastructure needs and is supported by sophisticated sales management, reporting and incentive systems. Our internal sales force is structured by product offerings, specialized industry segments and, with respect to our C2 product, by geographical region. Therefore, unlike certain other data center companies, we are less dependent on data center brokers to identify and acquire or renew our customers, which we believe is a key enabler of our 3Cs strategy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Security and Compliance Focused. Our operations and compliance teams, led by seasoned management, are focused on providing a high level of physical security, cybersecurity and compliance solutions in all of our data centers and through our 3Cs offerings.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Balance Sheet Positioned to Fund Continued Growth. As of December 31, 2016 we had approximately $571 million of available liquidity consisting of cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow under our unsecured revolving credit facility. As we continue to expand our real estate portfolio and the returns associated with that capacity, we can increase availability by an additional $300 million under the current unsecured credit facility. We believe that we are appropriately capitalized with sufficient funds and available borrowing capacity to pursue our anticipated business and growth strategies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Founder-Led Management Team with Proven Track Record and Strong Alignment with Our Stockholders. Our senior management team has significant experience in the ownership, management and redevelopment of commercial real estate through multiple business cycles. We believe our executive management team’s experience will enable us to capitalize on industry relationships by providing an ongoing pipeline of attractive leasing and redevelopment opportunities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ability to Increase Our Margins through Our Operating Leverage. We anticipate that our business and growth strategies can be substantially supported by our existing platform, will not require significant incremental general and administrative expenditures and will allow us to continue to benefit from operational leverage and increase operating margins.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continuing to Selectively Expand Our Fully Integrated Platform to Other Strategic Markets. We will continue to selectively pursue attractive opportunities in strategic locations and sectors where we believe our fully integrated platform would give us a competitive advantage in the acquisition and leasing of a facility or portfolio of assets. We also believe we can integrate additional data center facilities into our platform without adding significant incremental headcount or general and administrative expenses.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Commitment to Sustainability. We have a commitment to sustainability that focuses on managing our power and space as effectively and efficiently as possible. We believe that our continued efforts and proven results from sustainably redeveloping properties give us a distinct advantage over our competitors in attracting new customers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Competition
     We compete with developers, owners and operators of data centers and with IT infrastructure companies in the market for data center customers, properties for acquisition and the services of key third-party providers. In addition, we continue to compete with owners and operators of data centers and providers of cloud and managed services that follow other business models and may offer one or more of these services. We believe, however, that our 3Cs product offerings set us apart from our competitors in the data center industry and makes us more attractive to customers, both large and small. In addition, we believe other providers are seeking ways to enter or strengthen their positions in the data center market.
     We compete for customers based on factors including location, critical load, NRSF, flexibility and expertise in the design and operation of data centers, as well as our cloud product and the breadth of managed services that we provide. New customers who consider leasing space at our properties and using our products and existing customers evaluating whether to renew or extend a lease also may consider our competitors, including wholesale infrastructure providers and colocation and managed services providers. In addition, our customers may choose to own and operate their own data centers rather than lease from us. 
     As an owner, developer and operator of data centers and provider of Cloud and Managed Services, we depend on certain third-party service providers, including engineers and contractors with expertise in the development of data centers and the provision of managed services. The level of competition for the services of specialized contractors and other third-party providers increases the cost of engaging such providers and the risk of delays in operating our data centers and completing our development and redevelopment projects. We also rely upon the services of specialized contractors for the provision of internet connectivity and software-related platforms and services.  Competition for their services could lead to a negative impact on our business if they became unavailable to us.
     In addition, we face competition for the acquisition of additional properties suitable for the development of data centers from real estate developers in our industry and in other industries and from customers who develop their own data center facilities. Such competition may have the effect of reducing the number of available properties for acquisition, increasing the price of any acquisition and reducing the demand for data center space in the markets we seek to serve.
     Regulation 
     General 
     Data centers in our markets are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas. We believe that each of our properties has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business.      Americans With Disabilities Act 
     Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans With Disabilities Act (“ADA”) to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” or “commercial facilities” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require, for example, removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect.      Environmental Matters 
     Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, a current or former owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or 

 
  8

 
toxic substances, wastes or petroleum products on, under, from or in such property. These costs could be substantial, liability under these laws may attach without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint and several. Most of our properties presently contain large underground or aboveground fuel storage tanks for emergency power, which is critical to our operations. If any of our tanks has a release of fuel to the environment, we likely would have to pay to clean up the contamination. In addition, prior owners and operators used some of our current properties for industrial and other purposes, which could have resulted in environmental contamination. Moreover, the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may (1) expose us to third-party liability, (2) subject our properties to liens in favor of the government for damages and costs the government incurs in connection with the contamination, (3) impose restrictions on the manner in which a property may be used or businesses may be operated, or (4) materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. We also may be liable for the costs of remediating contamination at off-site disposal or treatment facilities where we arranged for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances at such facilities, without regard to whether we comply with environmental laws in doing so. Finally, there may be material environmental liabilities at our properties of which we are not aware. Any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on us.
     Our properties are subject to federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations and zoning requirements, including those regarding the handling of regulated substances and wastes, emissions to the environment, and fire codes. For instance, our properties are subject to regulations regarding the storage of petroleum for auxiliary or emergency power and air emissions arising from the use of power generators. In particular, our properties in California are subject to strict emissions limitations for its generators, which could be exceeded if we need to use these generators to supply critical backup power in a manner that results in emissions in excess of California limits. In addition, we lease some of our properties to our customers who also are subject to such environmental, health and safety laws and zoning requirements. If we, or our customers, fail to comply with these various requirements, we might incur costs and liabilities, including governmental fines and penalties. Moreover, we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether future requirements will require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures that will materially and adversely affect us. Environmental noncompliance liability also could affect a customer’s ability to make rental payments to us. We require our customers to comply with these environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. 
     See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry, for additional information regarding these risks.
     Privacy and Security 
     We may be directly and/or contractually subject to laws, regulations and policies for protecting sensitive data, consumer privacy and vital national interests. For example, the U.S. government has promulgated regulations and standards subject to authority provided through the enactment of a number of laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), and the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (“FISMA”), which require many corporations and federal, state and local governmental entities to control the security of, access to and configuration of their IT systems. A number of states also have enacted laws and regulations that require covered entities, such as data center operators, to implement and maintain security measures to protect certain types of information, such as Social Security numbers, payment card information, and other types of data, from unauthorized use and disclosure. In addition, industry organizations have adopted and implemented various security and compliance policies. For example, the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council has issued its mandatory Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”) which is applicable to all organizations processing payment card transactions. 
     In connection with certain of these laws, we are subject to audits and assessments, and we may be required to obtain certain certifications. Audit failure or findings of non-compliance can lead to significant fines or decertification from engaging in certain activities. For example, violations of HIPAA/HITECH Act regulations can lead to fines of up to $1.5 million for all violations of a particular provision in a calendar year and our failure to demonstrate compliance in an annual PCI DSS audit may result in fines and exclusion from payment card networks. Additionally, violations of privacy or security laws, regulations or standards increasingly lead to class-action litigation, which can result in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. We cannot assure you that future laws, regulations and standards, or future 

 
  9

 
interpretations of current laws, regulations and standards, related to privacy and security will not have a material adverse effect on us. 
     As a company that may process European personal data, we may also be subject to European data protection laws and regulations. The European Union (EU) Commission, Parliament, and Council adopted in April 2016 a new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that will take effect in May 2018. The GDPR will replace the current European privacy regime and will impose new privacy requirements as well as increase the likelihood of applicability of European law to entities established outside the EU but processing data of European data subjects. Under the GDPR, there can be fines of up to 10,000,000 Euros or up to 2 percent of the global sales for certain comparatively minor offenses, or up to 20,000,000 Euros or up to 4 percent of the global sales for more serious offenses. 
     To facilitate and legitimize the transfer of both client and personnel data from the European Union (“EU”) to the United States, we self-certified to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which requires organizations operating in the United States to provide assurance that they are adhering to relevant European standards for data protection for such transfers. QTS complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information transferred from the EU to the United States.  QTS has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. However, our self-certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield may not be sufficient to ensure compliance with GDPR. Legal challenges have been brought in European courts seeking to declare the Privacy Shield Framework invalid under European law as a mechanism to legitimize transfers of personal data from the EU to the United States, which could require us to implement alternative means to address European cross border data transfer requirement.
     Insurance 
     We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, earthquake, flood, business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio under a blanket policy. We also carry coverage for general liability, technology professional liability, and cybersecurity. We have selected policy specifications and insured limits that we believe to be appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice and, in the opinion of our management, the properties in our portfolio are currently adequately insured and the risk for any failure related to professional liability or a physical or cybersecurity breach are adequately covered by our insurance. We will not carry insurance for generally uninsured losses such as loss from riots, war, wet or dry rot, vermin and, in some cases, flooding, because such coverage is not available or is not available at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, although we carry earthquake and flood insurance on our properties in an amount and with deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable, such policies are subject to limitations in certain flood and seismically active zones. Certain of the properties in our portfolio will be located in areas known to be seismically active. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry—Uninsured and underinsured losses could have a material adverse effect on us.”     Employees 
     As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 780 persons, none of whom were represented by a labor union. We believe our relations with our employees are good. 
     Offices 
     Our executive headquarters is located at 12851 Foster Street, Overland Park, Kansas 66213, where our telephone number is (913) 814-9988. We believe that our current offices are adequate for our present operations; however, based on the anticipated growth of our company, we may add regional offices depending upon our future operational needs.
