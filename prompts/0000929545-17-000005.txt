ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 ﻿
 References to “we,” “our,” “us,” and the “Company” refer to Condor Hospitality Trust, Inc., including, as the context requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries.
 ﻿
 Overview
 ﻿
 Condor Hospitality Trust, Inc. (“CDOR,” “Condor,” or the “Company”), which until July 15, 2015 was formerly named Supertel Hospitality, Inc., was incorporated in Virginia on August 23, 1994 and was reincorporated in Maryland on November 19, 2014. Our common stock began to trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market on October 30, 1996 and today trades under the symbol “CDOR”.
 ﻿
 CDOR is a self-administered real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for federal income tax purposes that specializes in the investment and ownership of high-quality select-service, limited-service, extended stay, and compact full service hotels.  As of December 31, 2016, the Company owned 19 hotels, representing 2,047 rooms, in 12 states, including one hotel owned through an 80% interest in an unconsolidated joint venture (the “Atlanta JV”).
 ﻿
 Our significant events for 2016 include:
 ﻿

· | On various dates throughout the year, the Company sold 25 hotels for total gross proceeds of $61.4 million and primarily used the net proceeds, after repayment of the underlying loans, to fund acquisitions, to build cash reserves for future hotel acquisitions, and for general corporate purposes.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On March 16, 2016, the Company raised $30.0 million in a private placement transaction with an affiliate of the StepStone Group. The investment, structured as a new Series D Preferred Stock, includes a 6.25% annual dividend, payable quarterly, and may be converted by the holders into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $1.60 per share. Simultaneously with StepStone’s Series D Preferred Stock investment, the Company’s outstanding 6.25% Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series C Preferred Stock”), all of which was held by Real Estate Strategies L.P. (“RES”), was also 2 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


exchanged for the newly created Series D Preferred Stock. The Company used approximately $20.2 million of the proceeds from the $30.0 million raise to redeem all outstanding 8% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”) and 10% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred Stock”), including all unpaid accrued dividends, on April 15, 2016, resulting in one class of preferred stock for which the Company can require conversion entirely into common stock upon the occurrence of defined capital events. Excess proceeds were utilized by the Company to accelerate the strategic repositioning of its portfolio through the completion of acquisitions. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On May 26, 2016, the Company announced that it had moved its corporate headquarters to Bethesda, Maryland. The new corporate headquarters are located at 4800 Montgomery Lane, Suite 220, Bethesda, Maryland 20814. The Company continues to maintain leased office space in both Omaha and Norfolk, Nebraska. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On July 11, 2016, the Company reinstated common dividends for the first time since 2009. The Company declared a common stock dividend of $0.01 per share for the second quarter of 2016. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On August 22, 2016, the Company closed on the joint venture acquisition of the 254-room Aloft Atlanta located in downtown Atlanta at 300 Spring Street NW, Atlanta, GA. Condor entered into the Atlanta JV with Three Wall Capital (“TWC”), of which Condor owns 80% and TWC owns 20%, to acquire the hotel. The purchase price for the hotel was $43.6 million. The hotel is managed by Boast Hotel Management Company, LLC, an affiliate of TWC. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On September 16, 2016, the Company announced that it increased its common stock dividend to an annualized $0.12 per share for the third quarter of 2016.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On December 8, 2016, the Company declared its fourth quarter dividend of $0.03 per share.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On December 14, 2016, the Company closed on the acquisition of the 156-room Aloft Leawood / Overland Park (Kansas City) located within Park Place Village at 11620 Ash Street, Leawood, KS. The purchase price for the hotel was $22.5 million. The hotel is managed by Presidian Hotel and Resorts. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Subsequent to the close of 2016, the Company announced the following significant events.  These events are further discussed in the Subsequent Events footnote to the consolidated financial statements.

· | On January 23, 2017 the Company executed an agreement to purchase a portfolio of four Home2 Suites hotels for $73.8 million. The portfolio includes the Home2 Suites Memphis / Southaven, the Home2 Suites Austin / Round Rock, the Home 2 Suites Lexington University / Medical Center (Kentucky), and the Home2 Suites Tallahassee State Capitol. The closing of these acquisitions is anticipated to occur in the first quarter of 2017, but is subject to customary closing conditions including accuracy of representations and warrants and compliance with covenants and obligations. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On February 8, 2017, the Company announced that it had received commitment letters from two banks, KeyBank and The Huntington National Bank, for a $90.0 million secured credit facility. This credit facility subsequently closed on March 1, 2017. The new credit facility significantly reduced the Company’s weighted average cost of debt and enabled the refinancing of all 2017 and 2018 maturities. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On February 28, 2017, the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock voluntarily converted their shares into 39,032,225 shares of common stock at $1.60 per share pursuant to the terms of the preferred stock. The terms of the Series D Preferred Stock provided for automatic conversion following certain future common stock offerings, and also provided for potential additional payments to the holders depending on the sales price of common stock in the offerings. As a result of the voluntary conversion, the holders are no longer entitled to the potential payments. To induce the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock to voluntarily convert their shares, the Company issued the holders a $9.3 million of a new series of preferred stock, the Series E Preferred Stock.

  ﻿
 We conduct our business through a traditional umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT, in which our hotel properties are owned by our operating partnership, Condor Hospitality Limited Partnership and its subsidiaries (“CHLP”), for which we serve as general partner. As of December 31, 2016, we owned an approximate 97.8% ownership interest in CHLP.  In the future, CHLP may issue limited partnership interests to third parties from time to time in connection with our acquisition of hotel properties or the raising of capital.  The Company’s 100% owned E&P Financing Limited Partnership no longer owns any assets or conducts any operations following the sale of its last remaining property in January 2016.

﻿
 In order for the income from our hotel property investments to constitute “rents from real properties” for purposes of the gross income tests required by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for REIT qualification, the income we earn cannot be derived from the operation of any of our hotels.  Therefore, CHLP and its subsidiaries lease our hotel properties to the Company’s wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary, TRS Leasing, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries (“the TRS”). The TRS in turn engages third-party eligible independent contractors to manage the hotels.  CHLP, the TRS, and their respective subsidiaries are consolidated into the Company’s financial statements.  
 ﻿
 We are engaged primarily in the business of owning equity interests in hotel properties and therefore our business is disclosed as one reportable segment.  See the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for certain financial information required in this Item 1.
 ﻿
 Mission Statement 
 ﻿
 Our mission is to provide to our shareholders attractive total returns for the lodging sector through (1) disciplined investment in high-quality select-service, limited-service, extended stay, and compact full service hotels, and (2) intensive asset management to achieve enhanced results.
 ﻿
 We achieve this mission through the disciplined and efficient execution of the following Core Strategies:

· | Acquisition Strategy
--+---------------------


· | Disposition Strategy
--+---------------------


· | Asset Management Strategy
--+--------------------------


· | Financing Strategy
--+-------------------

  ﻿
 We understand that we cannot achieve our mission alone and therefore work with the following independent businesses, who we refer to as Business Partners, in the execution of our mission:

· | Franchise Partners
--+-------------------


· | Hotel Management Company Partners
--+----------------------------------

  ﻿
 Core Strategies
 ﻿
 Acquisition Strategy
 ﻿
 The objective of our acquisition strategy is to enable us to acquire assets that meet our target property characteristics and investment criteria at attractive valuations. We believe that our existing relationships with owners, operators, and developers of select-service hotels will provide us with access to certain off-market acquisition opportunities ahead of other real estate investors.  Typically, off-market transactions lead to more attractive valuation outcomes.  Our organizational documents do not limit the types of investments we can make; however, our intent is to execute the acquisition strategy as detailed herein. 
     We believe our target property characteristics and investment criteria, coupled with our ability to source off-market transactions, differentiates us from our peers and will enable us to achieve our mission to obtain attractive returns to our shareholders.
 ﻿
 Target Property Characteristics
 ﻿
 Our target properties are high-quality select-service, limited-service, extended stay, and compact full-service hotels located primarily in the top 100 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (“MSAs”), with a focus on the top 21 – 60 MSAs.  From time to time, we may acquire assets outside these target MSAs if we are able to acquire the asset at an attractive valuation and have confidence in the value proposition of the property.  If within a top 25 MSA, the asset will typically be located within an attractive sub- market of the larger MSA.  The hotels we will look to acquire will be franchised under premium flags by brands such as Hilton, Marriott/Starwood, IHG, and Hyatt and operated by third-party management companies.

In 2016, we acquired two assets that meet our investment criteria: Aloft Atlanta Downtown and the Aloft Leawood.  Subsequent to the close of 2016, we announced our intent to acquire four Home2 Suites hotels in the following markets: Austin-Round Rock (TX), Lexington (KY), Tallahassee (FL), and Memphis-Southaven (MS).  We expect to close on the acquisition of these four assets in the first quarter of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions and diligence.
 ﻿
 Investment Criteria
 ﻿
 We perform thorough due diligence and utilize extensive research to evaluate any target market or property.  This due diligence and research may include, but is not limited to, analyzing the long-term economic outlook of an MSA, reviewing trends in local lodging demand and supply, assessing property condition and required capital investment, and understanding historical property financial performance.  Specific investment criteria for hotels we are looking to acquire may include but are not limited to: 
· | hotels that operate under leading premium franchise brands and possess key attributes such as building design and décor that is consistent with current generation brand standards;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | hotels that are located within the top 100 MSAs, in close proximity to multiple demand drivers, including large corporations, regional hospitals, regional business hubs, recreational travel destinations, significant retail centers, and military installations, among others;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | hotels that are located within markets that have favorable economic, job growth, and demographic factors;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | hotels that have illustrated an ability to generate stabilized and dependable revenue and net operating income;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | hotels that were constructed less than ten years prior to our acquisition or have been recently significantly renovated to current brand standards, and have significant time (generally ten or more years) remaining on the existing franchise license; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | hotels that have some value-added growth potential through operating efficiencies, institutional asset management, repositioning, renovations, or rebranding;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | hotels that can be acquired at a discount to replacement cost; and/or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | hotels that can be acquired in off-market transactions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Disposition Strategy
 ﻿
 We have been engaged in a process of transitioning our portfolio from economy hotels to high-quality select-service, limited-service, extended stay, and compact full service hotels.  In order to achieve this objective, we have focused on disposing of legacy assets that do not meet the property characteristics and investment criteria discussed above.  Since January 1, 2015, we have sold 42 hotels.  The value unlocked from asset sales has been and will continue to be redeployed into newer, higher-quality assets meeting the acquisition strategy discussed above.  Just as we carefully evaluate the hotels we plan to acquire, our asset management team has evaluated the timing and composition of the legacy hotels to be disposed of in a manner we believe will maximize returns for our shareholders.  We are committed to a disciplined but timely monetization of the legacy assets in order to achieve the strategic repositioning of the portfolio.  In 2017, we will continue to dispose of assets that do not fit the new strategic vision of our portfolio and have announced plans to sell seven additional legacy hotels in the first half of 2017.
     Additionally, from time to time, we may undertake the sale of one or more hotels that meet the property characteristics and investment criteria discussed above.  These disposition decisions are the result of a thorough analysis and typically in response to changes in market conditions, our current or projected return on our investment in the hotel, or other factors which we deem relevant to the disposition decision.
 ﻿
 Asset Management Strategy
 ﻿
 Through collaboration with our third-party operators, we seek to maximize value to our shareholders through improvements to our existing hotels’ operating results.  We work toward this goal by constantly monitoring the performance of each individual hotel and identifying opportunities for value-enhancement through intensive asset management strategies.  We will make recommendations to our third-party operators in all aspects of our hotels operations, including revenue management, physical design, guest experience, market positioning, and overall

property strategy.  Fundamentally, all strategies are focused on growing the revenue of a hotel, controlling expenses, and/or maximizing the guest experience to drive returns. 
      We work with our third-party operators to develop short- and long-term capital investment plans that are focused on generating positive returns for our shareholders.  The capital improvements may involve investments in expansions, additions, renovations, technology upgrades, and/or energy efficiency improvements. 
      Additionally, from time to time, we may come to the conclusion that a particular asset may provide greater returns to our shareholders after an extensive repositioning of the asset in the market.  In these instances, capital investment in a greater amount than typical for an asset may be required to achieve the desired repositioning.  These decisions will be made after a thorough analysis of the property, market conditions, and the potential for a positive return on investment that exceeds our investment hurdle rates. 
 ﻿
 Financing Strategy
 ﻿
 Our financing strategy is to seek to minimize the cost of our capital in order to maximize the returns generated for our shareholders.  We intend to finance our long-term growth with equity capital raises and debt financings that have staggered maturities.  From time to time, when purchasing hotel properties, we may issue limited partnership interests in CHLP to third parties as full or partial consideration to sellers.  Currently, our debt includes a recourse line of credit secured by certain hotels and mortgages secured by our hotel properties.  In the future we plan on using a revolving credit facility, term loans, equity issuances, and mortgage debt financings to fund future acquisitions as well as for property redevelopments, return on investment initiatives, and working capital requirements. 
 ﻿
 Business Partners
 ﻿
 Franchise Partners
 ﻿
 We believe that in order to achieve our mission we must partner with the right franchisors of quality brands in our target segments.  To this end, we have built strong relationships with many of who we believe are the leading franchisors of the strongest brands in the segments we target, including Hilton, Marriott/Starwood, IHG, and Hyatt.  The franchisors provide a variety of benefits and value which include national advertising, marketing programs to increase brand awareness, personnel training, and centralized reservation systems.  We are constantly monitoring and evaluating the performance of these franchisors and their respective brands so that, when necessary, we can adapt our franchise partner strategy to maximize returns to our shareholders. 
 ﻿
 Under our franchise agreements, we are required to pay franchise fees generally between 3.3% and 5.5% of room revenue, plus additional fees for marketing, central reservation systems, and other franchisor programs and services that amount to between 2.5% and 6.0% of room revenue.  The franchise agreements typically have 10 to 25 year terms although certain agreements may be terminated by either party on certain anniversary dates specified in the agreements.  Further, each agreement provides for early termination fees in the event the agreement is terminated before the stated term.

 Hotel Management Company Partners
 ﻿
 As a REIT, we are not permitted to directly operate any of our hotels.  We partner closely with some of who we believe are the leading hotel management companies in order to operate our hotels with the ultimate objective of improving same-store hotel performance throughout our portfolio.  Each management agreement provides for a set term and is subject to early termination upon the occurrence of defaults and certain other events.  As required under the REIT qualification rules, each manager must qualify as an “eligible independent contractor” during the term of the management agreement.

  Seasonality of Hotel Business
 ﻿
 Historically, as a result of the geographic areas in which we operate, the operations of our hotels have been seasonal in nature.  Generally, occupancy rates, revenue, and operating income have been greater in the second and third quarters of the calendar year than in the first and fourth quarters, with the exception of our hotels located in Florida, which experience peak demand in the first and fourth quarters of the year.  The results of the recently acquired premium-branded select-service hotels, because of their locations and chain scale, are expected to be less seasonal in nature than our legacy portfolio of assets.
 ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 The hotel industry is highly competitive.  Each of our hotels is located in a developed area that includes other hotel properties.  The number of competitive hotel properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on revenue, occupancy, and the average daily room rate of our hotels or of hotel properties acquired in the future, and thus our financial results.
 ﻿
 We may compete for investment opportunities with entities that have substantially greater financial resources than us.  These entities generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage. Competition in general may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities for us and increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell.  
 ﻿
 Tax Status
 ﻿
 The Company qualifies and intends to continue to qualify as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), as amended.  In general, under such Code provisions, a trust which has made the required election and, in the taxable year, meets certain requirements and distributes to its shareholders at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent of the income currently distributed to shareholders.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will be unable to re-elect REIT status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we failed to qualify as a REIT, unless we satisfy certain relief provisions.  Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income.  Taxable income from non-REIT activities managed through the TRS, which is taxed as a C-Corporation, is subject to federal, state, and local income taxes.  
 ﻿
 Employees
 ﻿
 At December 31, 2016, Condor had 14 employees.  The staff at our hotels are employed by our third-party hotel managers.
