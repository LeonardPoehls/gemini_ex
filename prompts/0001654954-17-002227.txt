 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  
  General
  
 Paragon Commercial Corporation (the "Company"), was formed in 2001 to serve as the holding company for Paragon Commercial Bank (the "Bank"). The Company is a bank holding company registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve") under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA"). The Company's principal source of income is dividends declared and paid by the Bank on its capital stock, if any. The Company has no operations and conducts no business of its own other than owning the Bank and two statutory business trusts, Paragon Commercial Capital Trust I and II (the “Trusts”). Accordingly, the discussion of the business which follows concerns the business conducted by the Bank, unless otherwise indicated. The Company completed its initial public offering in June 2016.
  
 The Bank was incorporated on May 4, 1999 and began banking operations on May 10, 1999. The Bank is engaged in general commercial banking in Wake and Mecklenburg Counties, NC, operating under the banking laws of North Carolina and the rules and regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) and the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks (the “Commissioner”). The Bank undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities. In addition, the Company undergoes periodic examinations by the Federal Reserve.
  
 At December 31, 2016, the Company had total assets of $1.50 billion, net loans of $1.18 billion, deposits of $1.17 billion, total securities of $197.4 million, and stockholders' equity of $136.1 million.
  
 The Bank has a diversified loan portfolio, with no foreign loans and few agricultural loans. Real estate loans are predominately fixed rate commercial property loans. Commercial loans are predominately variable rate loans and are spread throughout a variety of industries with no one particular industry or group of related industries accounting for a significant portion of the commercial loan portfolio. The majority of the Bank's deposit and loan customers are individuals and small to medium-sized businesses located in the Bank's market area. Additional discussion of the Bank's loan portfolio and sources of funds for loans can be found in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on pages A-10 through A-38 of the Annual Report, which is included in this Form 10-K as Exhibit 13.1.
  
 The operations of the Bank and depository institutions in general are significantly influenced by general economic conditions and by related monetary and fiscal policies of depository institution regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Commissioner.
  
 The Company's fiscal year ends December 31. This Form 10-K is also being used as the Bank's Annual Disclosure Statement under FDIC Regulations. This Form 10-K has not been reviewed or confirmed for accuracy or relevance by the FDIC.
  
 At December 31, 2016, the Company employed 144 full-time employees and 8 part-time employees, which equated to 148 full-time equivalent employees.
  
  Subsidiaries
  
 The Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. At December 31, 2016, the Bank had two subsidiaries, PCB Trustee, Inc. and Mayberry Real Estate Holdings, LLC. PCB Trustee, Inc. serves as the corporate trustee on deeds of trust securing the Bank’s real estate loans. Mayberry Real Estate Holdings, LLC acquires, manages and disposes of real property, other collateral and other assets obtained in the ordinary course of collecting debts previously contracted.

 The Company formed Paragon Commercial Capital Trust I (“Trust I”) during 2004 in order to facilitate the issuance of trust preferred securities. Trust I is a statutory business trust formed under the laws of the state of Delaware, of which all common securities are owned by the Company. The Company formed Paragon Commercial Capital Trust II (“Trust II”) during 2006 to serve the same purpose. The junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company to the trusts are classified as debt and the Company’s equity interest in the trusts are included in other assets.
  
 The trust preferred securities presently qualify as Tier 1 regulatory capital and are reported in Federal Reserve regulatory reports as minority interests in unconsolidated subsidiaries. The junior subordinated debentures do not qualify as Tier 1 regulatory capital.
  
  Market Area
  
 The Company serves the Raleigh, North Carolina market and surrounding areas, including the Research Triangle Park, Durham and Chapel Hill, from its headquarters in Raleigh. In 2006, the Company expanded to Charlotte, North Carolina and in 2014 established a full-service office in Cary, North Carolina. Management believes that these markets have a combination of scale and attractive demographics to provide significant growth opportunities, while being small enough for the Company to establish a well-known brand.
  
 The Raleigh-Durham market area is composed of two metropolitan statistical areas, or MSAs, the Raleigh MSA and the Durham-Chapel Hill MSA, with a combined population of over 2.0 million. Raleigh is the capital of North Carolina and the market area is home to numerous universities and colleges, including the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina State University and Duke University. This market area has a diverse economy centered on state government, education, the technology industry, the medical and pharmaceuticals sectors, professional service firms and the many businesses that support these enterprises.
  
 Charlotte is the largest city in North or South Carolina and anchors a metropolitan statistical area with a total population in excess of 2.4 million. The Charlotte area is home to seven Fortune 500 companies, including one of the nation’s largest commercial banks. Charlotte also has concentrations in the transportation, utilities, education, professional services and construction sectors.
  
  Competition
  
 Commercial banking in North Carolina is extremely competitive due in large part to the early adoption of statewide branching. As of June 30, 2016, data provided by the FDIC Deposit Market Share Report indicated that within the Company’s market areas, there were 40 different commercial and savings institutions operating a total of 492 offices (254 in Wake County and 238 in Mecklenburg County). The Bank competes in its market area with large regional and nationwide banking organizations, other federally and state chartered financial institutions such as savings and loan institutions and credit unions, mortgage companies and other lenders engaged in the business of extending commercial credit. Many of its competitors have broader geographic markets and higher lending limits than the Bank and are also able to provide more services and make greater use of media advertising. All of the markets in which the Bank has an office are also served by branches of the largest banks in the Southeast, some of which are among the largest institutions in the United States.
  
 The enactment of legislation authorizing interstate banking has led to increases in the size and financial resources of some of the Company’s competitors. In addition, as a result of interstate banking, out-of-state commercial banks have acquired North Carolina banks and heightened the competition among banks in North Carolina. The Bank competes by offering customers modern banking services in a highly responsive private bank environment. It provides personalized services and attracts customers by being sensitive to their individualized needs. The Bank also relies on targeted marketing to attract new customers. To enhance a positive image in the communities that it serves, the Company supports and participates in local events and its officers and directors are active in supporting local civic and charitable organizations.

  Lending Activities
  
  General.  We provide a wide range of short- to medium-term commercial, construction, mortgage, and personal loans, both secured and unsecured.  In general, our loans are secured by collateral located in one of our markets with borrower equity and terms structured to match the purpose of the loan proceeds and the frequency of the primary source of repayment of the borrowers.  As of December 31, 2016, 97.7% of our overall loan portfolio was secured by collateral. Management focuses on the borrower’s ability to repay, normally measured as the cash flow generated from the borrower’s operations.  In underwriting credits, management views collateral as a secondary or tertiary source of repayment.   Variable rate loans accounted for 28.7% of the Bank’s loan balances outstanding as of December 31, 2016 while fixed rate loans accounted for 71.3% of the balances.
  
  Our loan policies and procedures establish the basic guidelines governing our lending operations.  Generally, these guidelines address the types of loans that we seek, target markets, underwriting and collateral requirements, loan terms and compliance with laws and regulations.  All loans or credit lines are subject to approval procedures and amount limitations.  These limitations apply to the borrower’s total outstanding indebtedness to us, including that of any guarantors.  The policies are reviewed and approved at least annually by the Bank’s board of directors.  We supplement our own supervision of the loan underwriting and approval process with periodic loan audits by internal personnel and outside professionals experienced in loan review work.
  
  Commercial Loans.  Commercial business lending is a primary focus of our lending activities. As of December 31, 2016, our commercial loan portfolio totaled $170.7 million. Commercial loans include secured loans for working capital, expansion and other business purposes.  Short-term working capital loans generally are secured by accounts receivable, inventory and/or equipment.  Our underwriting requirements for operating loans focus primarily on the conversion of the borrower’s working capital assets to cash and secondarily on the cash flow generated from operations.  Loan amounts are determined through industry-accepted margins on the borrower’s working capital assets and the length of payment recovery in the borrower’s business cycle.  We require personal guarantees and secondary sources of repayment for commercial loans.
  
  We also finance the intermediate assets of most businesses.  Terms for loans of this nature are matched with the useful economic life of the asset.  Advance rates are based on industry accepted collateral margins and are normally 50% to 85% of purchase cost or appraised value.
  
  Commercial Real Estate Loans.  Aggregate commercial real estate loan balances outstanding as of December 31, 2016 equaled $641.7 million, or 53.9% of our total loan portfolio.  Loan amounts within this category average approximately $1.01 million.  This lending involves loans secured by multifamily residential units, income-producing properties, owner-occupied commercial properties and land loans where the global cash flow of the principals is sufficient to service the credits.  Loan amounts generally conform to the regulatory loan-to-value guidelines and amortizations match the economic life of the collateral.  
  
  Loans secured by income-producing properties generally contain more risk than owner-occupied real estate, including one-to-four family residences.  We normally view real estate as the secondary source of repayment; however, an income-producing property’s value is reliant on the cash flow it generates.  We perform an analysis of the cash flow generated by a project or underlying business to determine if net operating income for such project exceeds a minimum of 1.20 times the debt payments.  The Bank’s underwriting policy requires sufficient borrower equity, pre-sale and pre-lease requirements along with personal guarantees of the principals.  Additional underwriting includes sensitivity analysis on rental, vacancy and interest rates.
  
  Due to the changing nature of the real estate markets, the Bank monitors its exposure by requiring annual reviews of certain loans and also periodic reviews of the various real estate market conditions.  On a quarterly basis the Bank’s board of directors is presented with portfolio stratification reports by risk grades and product types that include market data for the purpose of monitoring and maintaining the proper levels of diversification.  The Bank has established concentration guidelines that are also reviewed and changed as deemed necessary.

  Construction and Land Development Loans.  Another lending focus for us is construction and development lending.  The balances of construction loans outstanding as of December 31, 2016 totaled $79.7 million. Loan amounts for these types of loans average approximately $580,000.  We originate one-to-four family residential construction loans for the construction of custom homes and provide financing to builders and consumers for the construction of new homes.  While we finance non-presold homes, we place restrictions on the aggregate number and dollar amounts of such loans to any one builder. Our construction borrowers are local, well-established builders and not large, national tract builders. These builders have demonstrated a favorable record of performance, profitability and adequate levels of liquidity.  We limit risk through established underwriting guidelines to determine the level of exposure for each builder and limit the risk on individual projects through an inspection process.  We also may finance a limited amount of small tract developments and subdivisions.  We require principal guarantees with all construction loans.
  
  Residential Real Estate Loans.  We make residential real estate loans to borrowers to purchase and refinance one-to-four family properties as well as home equity loans on one-to-four family properties.  These services are offered as an adjunct to our private bank clients as a matter of convenience.  We provide customers access to long-term conventional real estate loans through our mortgage loan department, which underwrites loans for origination by unaffiliated third-party brokers in the secondary market.  We receive fees in connection with the origination of mortgage loans, with such fees aggregating $172,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $197,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015.  In addition to non-interest income generated by the origination of mortgage loans, we believe that offering such loans allows us to serve the convenience and needs of our customers while also affording an opportunity to cross-market our other loan and deposit products.
  
  Loans to Individuals.   Our loans to individuals include lines of credit, loans secured by titled automobiles, equipment and miscellaneous secured and unsecured personal loans.  We also offer credit cards as an accommodation to our customers.  As of December 31, 2016, our consumer loan portfolio totaled $11.5 million.  In underwriting such loans, we focus on the borrower’s past credit history and ability to repay the loan.  In most cases, we calculate a borrower’s repayment ability through gross debt to income benchmarks with the repayment ability of some business owners calculated through a global cash flow analysis based on the borrower’s tax return.  Default rates are higher in these categories and we are diligent in valuing highly depreciable collateral such as automobiles and equipment.   We structure the loan terms to match the loan purpose and advance on industry-accepted margins for the collateral securing the loan.
  
  Loan Approval, Credit Administration and Loan Review.  Certain credit risks are inherent in making loans.  These risks include repayment risks, risks resulting from uncertainties in the future value of collateral, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions, and risks inherent in dealing with borrowers.  We attempt to mitigate repayment risks by adhering to internal credit limits, a multi-layered approval process, documentation examination, and follow-up procedures.
  
  We emphasize a strong credit culture based on traditional credit measures and our knowledge of our markets through experienced client development officers.  Our credit culture begins with our client development officers, or CDOs, each of whom is required to have excellent credit skills.   The CDOs work closely with the credit department to underwrite loans and to present the loans to our credit administration department to complete the underwriting and approval process. Our credit administration department facilitates the approval process, which may include presentation to a loan committee depending on the total credit exposure. CDOs do not have individual loan authority in excess of $100,000.
  
  We also engage an outside loan review firm annually to provide extensive reviews of our commercial and consumer loan portfolios.   External loan review findings are reported to the President/CEO, the Director’s Loan Committee and the Audit Committee.   The scope and size of each external loan review engagement varies depending upon the economic, market, and internal circumstances facing the Bank at the time of the review.

  Our credit administration processes are managed by our Chief Credit Officer who has spent the past nine years with Paragon Bank, and has more than nineteen years of experience working in banking and finance overall. Our credit administration group consists of four experienced credit administrators with an average of more than twenty years of credit experience. Our credit administration, credit review and loan operation systems focus on approving sound credits while meeting numerous regulatory requirements including compliance regulations.
  
  At December 31, 2016, nonperforming loans were $968,000 or 0.08% of our total loan portfolio.  Nonperforming assets, including OREO, as a percent of total assets were 0.38% as of December 31, 2016.
  
  Loan Participations.  From time to time we sell loan participations to other banks within and outside our market area.  The sale of participations in larger loans to other financial institutions allows us to manage the risk involved in these credits while meeting the lending needs of customers that require extensions of credit in excess of our internal lending limits.  On rare occasions, the Bank has purchased loan participations from other financial institutions.  All loan participations purchased are underwritten using our standard and customary underwriting criteria.
  
  Courier Services
  
  We offer courier services to our business customers as a demonstration of our commitment to superior customer service.  Our couriers travel to the customer’s location, pick-up non-cash deposits from the customer and deliver those deposits to the Bank.  We feel our couriers serve as ambassadors for our Bank and enhance our presence in the markets we serve.
 Banking Technology
  
  We offer a full array of technology to our customers.  Our customers have the ability through online banking to pay bills, request check copies, reorder checks and make certain transfers.  We provide our customers with imaged check statements, which eliminate the cost of returning checks to customers and the clutter of canceled checks.  We also offer remote deposit capture, which allows customers to submit check images for deposit without leaving their offices.  This remote capture service augments our courier services, giving our customers the choice of either for more prompt deposit collection and crediting.  These services give us the ability to offer superior service and convenience to customers in each of our market areas from our efficient single-office business platform.
 Supervision and Regulation
  
 Bank holding companies and state commercial banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. The following is a brief summary of certain statutes, rules and regulations that affect or may affect the Company and Paragon Bank. This summary contains what management believes to be the material information related to the supervision and regulation of the Company and Paragon Bank but is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to their respective businesses, or to bank holding companies or banks generally. Supervision, regulation and examination of the Company and Paragon Bank by the regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund, or DIF, of the FDIC and the financial system rather than stockholders of the Company and Paragon Bank. We cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed statute or regulation will be adopted or the extent to which the business of the Company and Paragon Bank may be affected by a statute or regulation. Changes in such laws and regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects.

  Regulation of the Company
 
 As a registered bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation under the BHCA and to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Reserve. Pursuant to the BHCA, the Federal Reserve has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve Board has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or ownership constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company. The Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have adopted guidelines and released interpretative materials that establish operational and managerial standards to promote the safe and sound operation of banks and bank holding companies. These standards relate to the institution’s key operating functions, including but not limited to capital management, internal controls, internal audit system, information systems and data and cybersecurity, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure and risk management, vendor management, executive management and its compensation, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, liquidity and risk management.
 
 The BHCA generally prohibits a bank holding company from retaining direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company or engaging in activities other than banking, managing or controlling banks or other permissible subsidiaries and acquiring or retaining direct or indirect control of any company engaged in any activities other than activities closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks. In determining whether a particular activity is permissible, the Federal Reserve considers whether performing the activity can be expected to produce benefits to the public that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve has the power to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or control of any subsidiary when the continuation of the activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company.
 
 Under Federal Reserve policy and as codified by the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company is expected to act as a source of financial strength for Paragon Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank. This support may be required at times when the Company might not be inclined to provide it or it might not be in the Company’s best interests or the best interests of its stockholders. In addition, any capital loans made by the Company to Paragon Bank will be repaid only after the Bank’s deposits and various other obligations are repaid in full.
 
  Acquiring Control of a Bank Holding Company
 
 The Federal Reserve Board has jurisdiction under the BHCA to approve any bank or non-bank acquisition, merger or consolidation proposed by a bank holding company. The BHCA requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before:
 
  ● 
 it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of the voting shares of the bank;


  ● 
 it or any of its subsidiaries, other than a bank, may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank; or


  ● 
 it may merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company.


 The BHCA further provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or that would substantially lessen competition in the banking business, unless the public interest in meeting the needs of the communities to be served outweighs the anti-competitive effects. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks involved and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served. Consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy, and consideration of convenience and needs issues focuses, in part, on the performance under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, both of which are discussed elsewhere in more detail.

 Subject to various exceptions, the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring “control” of a bank holding company. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of a bank holding company. Control is also presumed to exist, although rebuttable, if a person or company acquires 10% or more, but less than 25%, of any class of voting securities and either:
 
  ● 
 the bank holding company has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act; or


  ● 
 no other person owns a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction.

 
 The Company’s common stock is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. The regulations provide a procedure for challenging rebuttable presumptions of control.
 
  Regulation of Paragon Bank
 
 Paragon Bank has a North Carolina state commercial bank charter and is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the FDIC and the Commissioner.
 
 Paragon Bank is also subject to numerous state and federal statutes and regulations that affect its business, activities and operations and is supervised and examined by state and federal bank regulatory agencies. The FDIC and the Commissioner regularly examine the operations of Paragon Bank and are given the authority to approve or disapprove mergers, consolidations, the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions. These agencies also have the power to prevent the continuance or development of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law. Each of Paragon Bank’s depository accounts is insured by the FDIC against loss to the depositor to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and federal law and regulatory policy impose a number of obligations and restrictions on the Company and Paragon Bank to reduce potential loss exposure to depositors and to the DIF.
 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or the FDIA, provides that amounts received from the liquidation or other resolution of any insured depository institution must be distributed, after payment of secured claims, to pay the deposit liabilities of the institution before payment of any other general creditor or stockholder of that institution – including that institution’s parent holding company. This provision would give depositors a preference over general and subordinated creditors and stockholders if a receiver is appointed to distribute the assets of a bank.
 
  Bank Merger Act
 
 Section 18(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, popularly known as the “Bank Merger Act,” requires the prior written approval of appropriate federal bank regulatory agencies before any bank may (i) merge or consolidate with, (ii) purchase or otherwise acquire the assets of, or (iii) assume the deposit liabilities of, another bank if the resulting institution is to be a state nonmember bank.
 
 The Bank Merger Act prohibits the applicable federal bank regulatory agency from approving any proposed merger transaction that would result in a monopoly, or would further a combination or conspiracy to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part of the United States. Similarly, the Bank Merger Act prohibits the applicable federal bank regulatory agency from approving a proposed merger transaction whose effect in any section of the country may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly, or which in any other manner would be in restraint of trade. An exception may be made in the case of a merger transaction whose effect would be to substantially lessen competition, tend to create a monopoly, or otherwise restrain trade, if the applicable federal bank regulatory agency finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served.
  
   
7


  
 
 In every proposed merger transaction, the applicable federal bank regulatory agency must also consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the existing and proposed institutions, the convenience and needs of the community to be served, and the effectiveness of each insured depository institution involved in the proposed merger transaction in combating money-laundering activities.
 
  State Regulation of the Company and the Bank
 
 Paragon Bank is subject to extensive supervision and regulation by the Commissioner. The Commissioner oversees state laws that set specific requirements for bank capital and that regulate deposits in, and loans and investments by, banks, including the amounts, types, and in some cases, rates. The Commissioner supervises and performs periodic examinations of North Carolina-chartered banks to assure compliance with state banking statutes and regulations, and banks are required to make regular reports to the Commissioner describing in detail their resources, assets, liabilities, and financial condition. Among other things, the Commissioner regulates mergers and consolidations of state-chartered banks, capital requirements for banks, loans to officers and directors, record keeping, types and amounts of loans and investments, and the establishment of branches.
 
 The Commissioner has extensive enforcement authority over North Carolina banks. Such authority includes the ability to issue cease and desist orders and to seek civil money penalties. The Commissioner may also take possession of a North Carolina bank in various circumstances, including for a violation of its charter or of applicable laws, operating in an unsafe and unsound manner, or as a result of an impairment of its capital, and may appoint a receiver.
 
 The Commissioner also regulates the Company pursuant to Chapters 53 and 53C of the North Carolina General Statutes. These laws require bank holding companies to register with the Commissioner and grant the Commissioner broad supervisory and enforcement authority in connection with formation, merger and change in control transactions involving North Carolina bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries. These laws also grant the Commissioner the ability to issue cease and desist orders and to seek civil money penalties.
 
  Payment of Dividends and Other Restrictions
 
 The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. While there are various legal and regulatory limitations under federal and state law on the extent to which banks can pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to holding companies, the principal source of cash revenues for the Company is dividends from the Bank, if any. The relevant federal and state regulatory agencies have authority to prohibit a state bank or bank holding company, which would include the Bank and the Company, from engaging in what, in the opinion of such regulatory body, constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business. The payment of dividends could, depending upon the financial condition of a bank, be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business.
 
 North Carolina commercial banks, such as Paragon Bank, are subject to legal limitations on the amounts of dividends they are permitted to pay. Specifically, an insured depository institution, such as Paragon Bank, is prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become “undercapitalized” (as such term is defined in the applicable law and regulations).
  
 The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve’s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the holding company’s net income for the past four quarters is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Furthermore, under the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if any of the holding company’s bank subsidiaries are classified as undercapitalized.

 A bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of its consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve.
 
  Capital Adequacy
 
 The Company must comply with the Federal Reserve’s established capital adequacy standards, and Paragon Bank is required to comply with the capital adequacy standards established by the FDIC. The Federal Reserve has promulgated two basic measures of capital adequacy for bank holding companies: a risk-based measure and a leverage measure. A bank holding company must satisfy all applicable capital standards to be considered in compliance.
 
 The risk-based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profile among banks and bank holding companies, account for off-balance-sheet exposure and minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets.
 
 Assets and off-balance-sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with designated weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance-sheet items. Under applicable capital standards, the minimum risk-based capital ratios are a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6%, and a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8%. In addition, to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Company and the Bank are required to meet a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital in addition to the minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio. The capital conservation buffer will be phased in over the period from January 1, 2016 until January 1, 2019, at which point it will be set at 2.5% common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, which sits “on top” of the 4.5% minimum common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets ratio. Common equity Tier 1 capital is predominantly comprised of retained earnings and common stock instruments (that meet strict delineated criteria), net of treasury stock, and after making necessary capital deductions and adjustments. Tier 1 capital is comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital, which consists of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and similar instruments meeting specified eligibility criteria. Total capital is comprised of Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital, which consists of subordinated debt with a minimum original maturity of at least five years and a limited amount of loan loss reserves.
 
 At December 31, 2016, Paragon Bank’s risk-based capital ratios, as calculated under the applicable capital standards, were 12.14% common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets, 12.36 % Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets, and 12.99 % total capital to risk weighted assets. At December 31, 2015, these ratios were 10.90%, 10.90% and 11.59%, respectively.
 
 In addition, the Federal Reserve has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies. These guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total on-balance sheet assets, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets, of 4% for bank holding companies. The Company’s leverage ratio was 10.05% at December 31, 2016 and 8.66% and 9.02% at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The guidelines also provide that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will consider a “tangible Tier 1 Capital leverage ratio” and other indications of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities.

 Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement actions, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on taking brokered deposits and certain other restrictions on its business. As described below, the FDIC can impose substantial additional restrictions upon FDIC-insured depository institutions that fail to meet applicable capital requirements.
 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or FDI Act, requires the federal regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” if a depository institution does not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDI Act establishes five capital tiers: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital category will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation.
 
 The federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted regulations establishing relevant capital measures and relevant capital levels applicable to FDIC-insured banks. The relevant capital measures are the Total Risk-Based Capital ratio, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio, Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio and the leverage ratio. Under the current regulatory framework, an FDIC-insured bank is:
 
  ● 
 “well capitalized” if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of 6.5% or greater and a leverage ratio of 5% or greater and is not subject to any order or written directive by the appropriate regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure;


  ● 
 “adequately capitalized” if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of 6% or greater, a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of 4.5% or greater and a leverage ratio of 4% or greater and is not “well capitalized”;


  ● 
 “undercapitalized” if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital ratio of less than 8%, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of less than 6%, a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of less than 4% or a leverage ratio of less than 4%;


  ● 
 “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital ratio of less than 6%, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of less than 4%, a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of less than 3% or a leverage ratio of less than 3%; and


  ● 
 “critically undercapitalized” if its tangible equity is equal to or less than 2% of average quarterly tangible assets.


 An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. As of December 31, 2016, Paragon Bank had capital levels that qualify as “well capitalized” under applicable regulations.
 
 The FDI Act generally prohibits an FDIC-insured bank from making a capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the bank is or would thereafter be “undercapitalized.” “Undercapitalized” banks are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The federal regulators may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the bank’s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the bank’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan until the institution has been adequately capitalized on average during each of four consecutive calendar quarters. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company under such guarantee is limited to the lesser of: (i) an amount equal to 5% of the bank’s total assets at the time it became “undercapitalized”; and (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.”

 “Significantly undercapitalized” insured banks may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become “adequately capitalized,” requirements to reduce total assets and the cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. A bank that is not “well capitalized” is also subject to certain limitations relating to brokered deposits.
 
 The regulatory capital framework under which the Company and Paragon Bank operate has changed significantly in recent years as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted in July 2010, and other regulations, including the separate regulatory capital requirements put forth by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly known “Basel III.”
 
 In July 2013, the Federal Reserve, FDIC and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency approved final rules that established an integrated regulatory capital framework that addressed shortcomings in certain capital requirements. The rules implemented in the United States the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules began to apply to the Company and the Bank beginning January 1, 2015.
 
 The major provisions of the rules applicable to the Company and the Bank are:
 
  ● 
 The rules implement higher minimum capital requirements described above in this section, including a new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement and capital conservation buffer, and establish criteria that instruments must meet in order to be considered common equity Tier 1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital, or Tier 2 capital. Among the most important changes are stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments that would disallow the inclusion of instruments such as trust preferred securities in Tier 1 capital going forward, and new constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets (MSAs), deferred tax assets (DTAs), and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. These enhancements both improve the quality and increase the quantity of capital required to be held by banking organizations compared to the previous capital rules, better equipping the U.S. banking system to deal with adverse economic conditions.


  ● 
 The rules also affect the inclusion of mortgage servicing assets, or MSAs, as an element of capital. Specifically, MSAs are limited to 10% of a bank’s common equity Tier 1 capital and the combined balance of MSAs, deferred tax assets, and investments in the common stock of unconsolidated financial institutions is limited to 15% of a bank’s common equity Tier 1 capital. These combined assets must be deducted from common equity to the extent that they exceed the 15% threshold. Any portion of a bank’s MSAs that are not deducted from the calculation of common equity Tier 1 will be subject to a 100% risk weight that will increase to 250% in 2018.


   ● 
 The rules also increase the risk weights for past-due loans, certain commercial real estate loans, and some equity exposures, and make selected other changes in risk weights and credit conversion factors.


 Continued compliance by the Company and Paragon Bank with these capital requirements will likely affect their respective operations.
 
  The Volcker Rule
 
 Under provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act referred to as the “Volcker Rule,” and related rules adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, certain limitations are placed on the ability of insured depository institutions and their affiliates to engage in sponsoring, investing in and transacting with certain investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds. The Volcker Rule also places restrictions on proprietary trading, which could impact certain hedging activities. The Volcker Rule became fully effective in July 2015, and banking entities had until July 2016 to divest certain legacy investments in covered funds. The Volcker Rule is not expected to have a material impact on the operations of the Company or the Bank.

  Real Estate Lending Evaluations
 
 The federal regulators have adopted uniform standards for evaluations of loans secured by real estate or made to finance improvements to real estate. Banks are required to establish and maintain written internal real estate lending policies consistent with safe and sound banking practices and appropriate to the size of the institution and the nature and scope of its operations. The regulations establish loan to value ratio limitations on real estate loans. Paragon Bank’s respective loan policies establish limits on loan to value ratios that are equal to or less than those established in such regulations.
 Commercial Real Estate Concentrations
 
 Lending operations of commercial banks may be subject to enhanced scrutiny by federal banking regulators based on a bank’s concentration of commercial real estate, or CRE, loans. The federal banking regulators have issued final guidance to remind financial institutions of the risk posed by CRE, lending concentrations. CRE loans generally include land development, construction loans, and loans secured by multifamily property, and nonfarm, nonresidential real property where the primary source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property. The guidance prescribes the following guidelines for regulatory examiners to help identify institutions that are potentially exposed to significant CRE risk and may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny:
 
  ● 
 total reported loans for construction, land development and other land, or C&D, represent 100% or more of the institution’s total capital; or


  ● 
 total CRE loans represent 300% or more of the institution’s total capital, and the outstanding balance of the institution’s CRE loan portfolio has increased over 50% or more during the prior 36 months.


 As of December 31, 2016, the Bank’s C&D concentration as a percentage of bank capital totaled 49.2% and its CRE concentration, net of owner-occupied loans, as a percentage of capital totaled 329.5%.
  
  Limits on Loans to One Borrower
  
 The Bank generally is subject to both FDIC regulations and North Carolina law regarding loans to any one borrower, including related entities. Under applicable law, with certain limited exceptions, loans and extensions of credit by a state chartered nonmember bank to a person outstanding at one time and not fully secured by collateral having a market value at least equal to the amount of the loan or extension of credit may not exceed 15% of Total Risk-Based Capital of the Bank. Loans and extensions of credit fully secured by readily marketable collateral having a market value at least equal to the amount of the loan or extension of credit may not exceed an additional 10% of Total Risk-Based Capital of the Bank. The Bank’s legal lending limit for loans to one borrower was approximately $24.31 million at December 31, 2016. At that date, the Bank had no lending relationships in excess of the loans-to-one-borrower limit. The Bank has imposed an internal lending limit and maximum relationship exposure of approximately $10 million for new extensions of credit, with exceptions approved by a committee of the Bank’s board of directors.
 Restrictions on Affiliate Transactions
 
 Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act establish parameters for a bank to conduct “covered transactions” with its affiliates, with the objective of limiting risk to the insured bank. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B (i) limit the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such bank’s capital stock and surplus, and limit the aggregate of all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus and (ii) require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the bank or subsidiary as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans to the affiliate, purchase of assets from the affiliate, issuance of a guarantee on behalf of the affiliate and several other types of transactions.
  
   
12


  
 
 The Dodd-Frank Act imposed additional restrictions on transactions between affiliates by amending these two sections of the Federal Reserve Act. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, restrictions on transactions with affiliates are enhanced by (i) including among “covered transactions” transactions between bank and affiliate-advised investment funds; (ii) including among “covered transactions” transactions between a bank and an affiliate with respect to securities repurchase agreements and derivatives transactions; (iii) adopting stricter collateral rules; and (iv) imposing tighter restrictions on transactions between banks and their financial subsidiaries.
  
  Liquidity Requirements
  
 FDIC policy requires that banks maintain an average daily balance of liquid assets (cash, certain time deposits, mortgage-backed securities, loans available for sale and specified United States government, state, or federal agency obligations) in an amount which it deems adequate to protect the safety and soundness of the bank.  The FDIC currently has no specific level which it requires. The Bank maintains its liquidity position under policy guidelines based on liquid assets in relationship to total assets.  Based on its policy calculation guidelines, the Bank’s calculated liquidity ratio was 12.10% of total assets at December 31, 2016, which management believes is adequate.
 Regulatory Restrictions on Acquisitions
 
 The Company must comply with numerous laws related to any potential acquisition activity. As described above, a bank holding company may not directly or indirectly acquire ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank or merge or consolidate with another bank holding company without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. The Company’s acquisition of non-banking companies is also regulated by the Federal Reserve. Current federal law authorizes interstate acquisitions of banks and bank holding companies without geographic limitation, subject to Federal Reserve approval and certain other conditions and concentration limits. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act amended federal law to permit banks to establish a de novo branch in any state if that state would permit a bank organized in that state to open a branch.
 FDIC Insurance Assessments
 
 The assessment rate paid by each DIF member institution is based on its relative risks of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other factors. Specifically, the assessment rate is based on the institution’s capitalization risk category and supervisory subgroup category. An institution’s capitalization risk category is based on the FDIC’s determination of whether the institution is well capitalized, adequately capitalized or less than adequately capitalized. Paragon Bank’s insurance assessments during 2016 and 2015 were $595,000 and $836,000, respectively. The FDIC may also require special assessments if conditions warrant. An institution’s supervisory subgroup category is based on the FDIC’s assessment of the financial condition of the institution and the probability that FDIC intervention or other corrective action will be required. The FDIC may terminate insurance of deposits upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.
  
 The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the base for FDIC insurance assessments, requiring that assessments be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. On February 7, 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule to implement the foregoing provision of the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other things, the final rule revised the assessment rate schedule to provide initial base assessment rates ranging from 5 to 35 basis points, subject to adjustments which can increase or decrease the total base assessment rates. The FDIC has three possible adjustments to an institution’s initial base assessment rate: (1) a decrease of up to five basis points (or 50% of the initial base assessment rate) for long-term unsecured debt, including senior unsecured debt (other than debt guaranteed under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program) and subordinated debt; (2) an increase for holding long-term unsecured or subordinated debt issued by other insured depository institutions known as the Depository Institution Debt Adjustment; and (3) for institutions not well rated and well capitalized, an increase not to exceed 10 basis points for brokered deposits in excess of 10 percent of domestic deposits.
  
   
13


  
 
 The law also gave the FDIC enhanced discretion to set assessment rate levels.
 
 The FDIC also collects a deposit-based assessment from insured financial institutions on behalf of the Financing Corporation, or the FICO. The funds from these assessments are used to service debt issued by FICO in its capacity as a financial vehicle for the Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation. The FICO assessment rate is set quarterly and in 2016 ranged from 58 basis points in the first quarter to 56 basis points in the fourth quarter per $100 of assessable deposits. These assessments will continue until the debt matures in 2017 through 2019.
 
  Community Reinvestment Act
 
 The Community Reinvestment Act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to encourage financial institutions to meet the credit needs of low and moderate-income borrowers in their local communities. An institution’s size and business strategy determines the type of examination that it will receive. Large, retail-oriented institutions are examined using a performance-based lending, investment and service test. Small institutions are examined using a streamlined approach. All institutions may opt to be evaluated under a strategic plan formulated with community input and pre-approved by the bank regulatory agency.
 
 The Community Reinvestment Act regulations provide for certain disclosure obligations. Each institution must post a notice advising the public of its right to comment to the institution and its regulator on the institution’s Community Reinvestment Act performance and to review the institution’s Community Reinvestment Act public file. Each lending institution must maintain for public inspection a file that includes a listing of branch locations and services, a summary of lending activity, a map of its communities and any written comments from the public on its performance in meeting community credit needs. The Community Reinvestment Act requires public disclosure of the regulators’ written Community Reinvestment Act evaluations of financial institutions. This promotes enforcement of Community Reinvestment Act requirements by providing the public with the status of a particular institution’s community reinvestment record.
 
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act made various changes to the Community Reinvestment Act. Among other changes, Community Reinvestment Act agreements with private parties must be disclosed and annual Community Reinvestment Act reports relating to such agreements must be made available to a bank’s primary federal regulator. A bank holding company will not be permitted to become a financial holding company and no new activities authorized under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act may be commenced by a holding company or by a bank financial subsidiary if any of its bank subsidiaries received less than a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating in its latest Community Reinvestment Act examination. Paragon Bank received a “Satisfactory” rating in its last CRA examination, which was conducted as of January 19, 2016.
  
  Additional Legislative and Regulatory Matters
  
 The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the USA PATRIOT Act, requires each financial institution: (i) to establish an anti-money laundering program; (ii) to establish due diligence policies, procedures and controls with respect to its private banking accounts involving foreign individuals and certain foreign banks; and (iii) to avoid establishing, maintaining, administering or managing correspondent accounts in the United States for, or on behalf of, foreign banks that do not have a physical presence in any country. The USA PATRIOT Act also requires the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe by regulation minimum standards that financial institutions must follow to verify the identity of customers, both foreign and domestic, when a customer opens an account. In addition, the USA PATRIOT Act contains a provision encouraging cooperation among financial institutions, regulatory authorities and law enforcement authorities with respect to individuals, entities and organizations engaged in, or reasonably suspected of engaging in, terrorist acts or money laundering activities. The USA PATRIOT ACT also contained the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, which sets forth anti-money laundering measures affecting insured depository institutions, broker-dealers and other financial institutions. The act requires U.S. financial institutions to adopt new policies and procedures to combat money laundering and grants the Secretary of the Treasury broad authority to establish regulations and to impose requirements and restrictions on the operations of financial institutions.

 The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the OFAC rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure of a financial institution to comply with these sanctions could result in legal consequences for the institution.
 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 applies to public companies a variety of requirements to address corporate and accounting fraud and protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. Sarbanes-Oxley imposes higher standards for auditor independence and restricts the provision of consulting services by auditing firms to companies they audit and requires that certain audit partners be rotated periodically. It also requires chief executive officers and chief financial officers, or their equivalents, to certify the accuracy of periodic reports filed with the SEC, subject to civil and criminal penalties if they knowingly or willfully violate this certification requirement, and increases the oversight and authority of audit committees of publicly traded companies.
 
  Fiscal and Monetary Policy
 
 Banking is a business which depends on interest rate differentials for success. In general, the difference between the interest paid by a bank on its deposits and its other borrowings, and the interest received by a bank on its loans and securities holdings, constitutes a significant portion of a bank’s earnings. Thus, the Company’s earnings and growth will be subject to the influence of economic conditions generally, both domestic and foreign, and also to the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money through various means, including open market dealings in United States government securities, the discount rate at which banks may borrow from the Federal Reserve and the reserve requirements on deposits. The nature and timing of any changes in such policies and their effect on the Company’s business and results of operations cannot be predicted.
 
 Current and future legislation and the policies established by federal and state regulatory authorities will affect the Company’s future operations. Banking legislation and regulations may limit the Company’s growth and the return to its investors by restricting certain of its activities.
 
 In addition, capital requirements could be changed and have the effect of restricting the activities of the Company or requiring additional capital to be maintained. Management cannot predict with certainty what changes, if any, will be made to existing federal and state legislation and regulations or the effect that such changes may have on the Company’s business and results of operations.
 
  Limitations on Incentive Compensation
 
 In June 2010, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued incentive compensation guidance that covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group. This guidance is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward and, thus, do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The guidance provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
  
   
15


  
 
 As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, in March 2011 the SEC and the federal bank regulatory agencies (including the Federal Reserve and the FDIC) proposed regulations that would prohibit financial institutions with assets of at least $1 billion from maintaining executive compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to material financial loss. These proposed regulations incorporate the principles discussed in the Federal Reserve’s June 2010 incentive compensation guidance. In May 2016, the federal bank regulatory agencies replaced the regulations proposed in 2011 with a new proposal. If the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed, they will impose limitations on the manner in which the Company may structure compensation for its executives. The comment period for these proposed regulations has closed and a final rule has not been published.
 
  Financial Holding Company Status
 
 Under the BHCA, a bank holding company may file an election with the Federal Reserve to be treated as a financial holding company and engage in an expanded list of financial activities. The election must be accompanied by a certification that all of the company’s insured depository institution subsidiaries are “well capitalized” and “well managed.” Additionally, the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 rating of each subsidiary bank must be satisfactory or better. If, after becoming a financial holding company and undertaking activities not permissible for a bank holding company, the company fails to continue to meet any of the prerequisites for financial holding company status, the company must enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve may order the company to divest its subsidiary banks or the company may discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company. The Company is not a financial holding company and qualification as such by other bank holding companies has not had a material effect on the Company’s or the Bank’s business.
 Economic Environment
 
 The policies of regulatory authorities, including the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, have a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Among the means available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and may affect interest rates, and thus may impact the distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and interest rates that banks charge on loans or pay on deposits. The Federal Reserve’s monetary policies have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The nature of future monetary policies and the effect of these policies on the Company’s business and earnings cannot be predicted.
 Evolving Legislation and Regulatory Action
 
 The Company and the Bank continue to experience a period of rapidly changing regulations and an environment of constant regulatory reform. The most significant regulatory reform in recent years, the Dodd-Frank Act, was signed into law in 2010 and implements many changes to how financial and banking operations are regulated in the United States, including through the creation of a new resolution authority, mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements, requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies and numerous other provisions intended to strengthen the financial services sector. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or the FSOC, was created and is charged with overseeing and coordinating the efforts of the primary U.S. financial regulatory agencies (including the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the SEC) in establishing regulations to address systemic financial stability concerns. Under the Dodd-Frank Act the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, was also created as a new consumer financial services regulator. The CFPB is authorized to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices and ensure that consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services and that such markets are fair, transparent and competitive.

 Legislative and regulatory initiatives are periodically introduced in the U.S. Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions, and could change banking statutes and regulations or the operating environment of the Company and Paragon Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways. Management cannot predict whether any new legislation or regulations will be adopted or any other such initiatives will be commenced and, if adopted or commenced, the effect that it would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company or Paragon Bank.
  
  February 3, 2017, Executive Order
  
 On February 3, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order calling for the administration to review existing U.S. financial laws and regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Act, in order to determine their consistency with a set of “core principles” of financial policy. The core financial principles identified in the executive order include the following: empowering Americans to make independent financial decisions and informed choices in the marketplace, save for retirement, and build individual wealth; preventing taxpayerfunded bailouts; fostering economic growth and vibrant financial markets through more rigorous regulatory impact analysis that addresses systemic risk and market failures, such as moral hazard and information asymmetry; enabling American companies to be competitive with foreign firms in domestic and foreign markets; advancing American interests in international financial regulatory negotiations and meetings; and restoring public accountability within federal financial regulatory agencies and “rationalizing” the federal financial regulatory framework.
  
 Although the order does not specifically identify any existing laws or regulations that the administration considers to be inconsistent with the core principles, areas that may be identified for reform include the Volcker Rule; any “fiduciary” standard applicable to investment advisers and broker-dealers; and the powers, structure and funding arrangements of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Office of
  Financial Research, the prudential bank regulators, the SEC, CFTC, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. While some changes can be implemented by the regulatory agencies themselves, implementing much of the anticipated agenda of changes would require legislation from Congress.
