ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
Federal-Mogul Holdings LLC is a limited liability company formed under the laws of Delaware. On February 14, 2017, Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation was converted to a single member limited liability corporation in the U.S. and changed its name to Federal-Mogul Holdings LLC. References herein to the “Company,” “Federal-Mogul,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to Federal-Mogul Holdings LLC for the period after the effective date of the conversion on February 14, 2017, Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation for the period after the effective date of the Reorganization (subsequently defined below) on April 15, 2014, and Federal-Mogul Corporation for the period prior to the effective date of the Reorganization on April 15, 2014. 
Holding Company Reorganization: On April 15, 2014, Federal-Mogul Corporation completed a holding company reorganization (the “Reorganization”). As a result of the Reorganization, the outstanding shares of Federal-Mogul Corporation common stock were automatically converted on a one-for-one basis into shares of Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation common stock, and all of the stockholders of Federal-Mogul Corporation immediately prior to the Reorganization automatically became stockholders of Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation. The rights of stockholders of Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation are generally governed by Delaware law and Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which are the same in all material respects as those of Federal-Mogul Corporation immediately prior to the Reorganization. In addition, the board of directors of Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation and its Audit Committee and Compensation Committee were composed of the same members as the board of directors, Audit Committee and Compensation Committee of Federal-Mogul Corporation prior to the Reorganization.
Merger Transaction: On September 6, 2016, the Company, American Entertainment Properties Corp., a Delaware corporation (“AEP”), our parent and a subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises L.P. ("IEP"), and IEH FM Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Merger Sub”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Merger Sub commenced a cash tender offer (the "Offer) to acquire, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, not already owned by IEP affiliates, for a purchase price of $9.25 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest, less any applicable tax withholding.
On January 3, 2017, the Company announced it had received a revised proposal to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock for $10.00 per share, an increase from the previous offer of $9.25 in cash per share. On January 23, 2017, AEP, and Merger Sub completed the acquisition of the Company as all terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement were satisfied. Shares of the Company's stock are no longer publicly traded as of the close of business January 23, 2017.
Spinoff: On September 3, 2014, we announced a plan to separate our Powertrain and Motorparts divisions into two independent, publicly-traded companies serving the global original equipment and aftermarket industries. 
On January 15, 2016, we announced a termination of the previously announced spin-off of our Motorparts division. We will continue to operate with two separate, independent businesses with separate CEOs who will each report directly to our board of directors. The separate businesses more effectively serve their unique markets and allow each operating business to pursue its business strategy and more quickly react to our respective market conditions. 
Interests Held by an Entity Controlled by Mr. Carl C. Icahn
As of December 31, 2016, Mr. Carl C. Icahn indirectly controlled approximately 81.99% of the voting power of the Company’s capital stock and, by virtue of such stock ownership, is able to control or exert substantial influence over the Company, including the election of directors, business strategy and policies, mergers or other business combinations, acquisition or disposition of assets, future issuances of common stock or other securities, incurrence of debt or obtaining other sources of financing, and the payment of dividends on the Company’s common stock. Under applicable law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, certain actions cannot be taken without the approval of holders of a majority of our voting stock including, without limitation, mergers, the sale of substantially all of our assets, and amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. So long as Mr. Icahn continues to control a majority of our outstanding capital stock, he will continue to have these governance rights and the ability to control Federal-Mogul Holdings LLC. As a result of the Merger Transaction and subsequent conversion, the entity indirectly owned and controlled by Mr. Icahn became the sole member of the Company.

Business Overview
We are a leading global supplier of technology and innovation in vehicle and industrial products for fuel economy, emissions reduction, and safety systems. We serve the world’s foremost original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) and servicers (“OES”) (collectively “OE”) of automotive, light, medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, off-road, agricultural, marine, rail, aerospace, power generation and industrial equipment, as well as the independent aftermarket. We seek to participate in both of these markets by leveraging our original equipment product engineering and development capability, manufacturing know-how, and expertise in managing a broad and deep range of replacement parts to service the aftermarket. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to effectively manage the life cycle of a broad range of products to a diverse customer base. We are a leading technology supplier and a market share leader in several product categories. As of December 31, 2016, we had current OEM products included on more than 400 global vehicle platforms and more than 800 global powertrains used in light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles. We offer premium brands, OE replacement, and entry/mid-level products for all aftermarket customers. This broad range of vehicle and powertrain applications reinforces our belief in our unique market position.
We operate with two end-customer focused business segments. The Powertrain segment focuses on original equipment powertrain products for automotive, heavy duty, and industrial applications. The Motorparts segment sells and distributes a broad portfolio of products in the global aftermarket and also serves original equipment manufacturers with products including braking, wipers, and a limited range of chassis components. This organizational model allows for a strong product line focus benefitting both original equipment and aftermarket customers and enables us to be responsive to customers’ needs for superior products and to promote greater identification with our premium brands. Additionally, this organizational model enhances management focus to capitalize on opportunities for organic or acquisition growth, profit improvement, capital allocation, and business model optimization in line with the unique requirements of the two different customer bases and business models.
Powertrain offers its customers a diverse array of market-leading products for OE applications, including pistons, piston rings, piston pins, cylinder liners, engine valves, valve seats and guides, ignition products, dynamic seals, bonded piston seals, combustion and exhaust gaskets, static gaskets and seals, rigid heat shields, engine bearings, industrial bearings, bushings and washers, element resistant systems protection sleeving products, acoustic shielding, and flexible heat shields. Motorparts offers powertrain products, typically manufactured by Powertrain, and is also a leading global manufacturer and distributor of brake disc pads, brake linings, brake blocks, brake system components, chassis and driveline products, engine gaskets and seals, filters, wipers, lighting, and other product lines to OE and aftermarket customers. 
We have manufacturing facilities, technical centers, distribution centers, and warehouses in 24 countries. Accordingly, our reporting segments derive sales from both domestic and international markets. The attendant risks of our international operations are primarily related to foreign currency fluctuations, changes in local economic and political conditions, extraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and changes in laws and regulations.

Product | Description 
Pistons | The main task of the piston is to compress the air and fuel mixture in advance of ignition. Following combustion, the piston relays the combustion energy into mechanical energy. In this process, substantial pressures are exerted on the piston, imposing high demands on it in terms of rigidity and temperature resistance. 
Piston Rings | The three main tasks of piston rings in internal combustion engines include: (1) sealing the combustion chamber, (2) supporting heat transfer from the piston to the cylinder wall, and (3) regulating lubrication and oil consumption. 
Piston Pins | Piston pins attach the piston to the end of the connecting rod, allowing the piston to pivot in each cycle of the engine and following the revolution of the crankshaft. 
Cylinder Liners | Cylinder liners, or sleeves, are specially engineered where surfaces formed within the engine block, working in tandem with the piston and ring, as the chamber in which the thermal energy of the combustion process is converted into mechanical energy. 
Valve Seats and Guides | Valve seats and guides are a wide variety of powdered metal inserts used in engines and general industrial applications, which are specially designed to meet customer requirements for extreme hardness. 
Engine Valves | Engine valves are used to control the air and fuel flow into and out of the cylinders, facilitating the combustion process. Valve designs consist of mono, bimetallic, and hollow valves depending on application, which includes automotive and various industrial requirements including marine and power generation. The product line also provides other related valve train components including cotters, rotators, and retainers. 
Engine Bearings | Engine bearings provide an intermediate surface between the connecting rod and crankshaft and between the crankshaft and engine block. Their purpose is to facilitate the conversion of combustion energy into mechanical energy by allowing low-friction movement of the connecting rods and crankshaft when absorbing the power created in the combustion chamber. They operate principally under hydrodynamic lubrication conditions. The bearing product line includes lead-free aluminum engine bearings commonly used in gasoline engines and bronze bearings used in highly-loaded compression engines such as diesel or gasoline turbocharged models.

Ignition | Ignition products include spark plugs, glow plugs, ignition coils, and accessories for automotive, commercial, and industrial applications. 
Dynamic Seals | Dynamic seals are used between a housing or body structure and rotating or moving shafts to contain lubricants, fluids, and pressure inside the housing, while keeping out dust and other contaminates. There are numerous areas of application including engine crankshaft, transmission driveshaft, pinion and axle, and wheel seals. 
Bonded Piston Seals | Bonded piston seals use hydraulic pressure in transmissions to facilitate gearshift. These products are used in automatic, dual clutch transmissions, and continuously variable transmissions. 
Combustion and Exhaust Gaskets | Combustion and exhaust gaskets are used between two surfaces to contain gas and pressure produced from combustion. These gaskets are primarily used on internal combustion engine applications including cylinder head, exhaust manifold, exhaust takedown, exhaust gas recirculation, and turbocharger gaskets. 
Static Gaskets and Seals | Static gaskets and seals create a barrier between two surfaces to contain fluids, pressure, and gases while keeping out dust and other contaminants. There are numerous areas of application including engine covers, oil pans, intake manifolds, transmission covers, and differential covers. 
Rigid Heat Shields | Rigid heat shields are designed to provide a heat and sound barrier to emitting components. These products cover a full range of application on a vehicle from engine to tailpipe. 
Flexible Heat Shields | Flexible heat shields are designed to provide a heat barrier and for thermal management usually in the engine compartment. 
Element Resistant Sleeving | Element resistant sleeving products provide protection for wires, hoses, sensors, and mechanical components and assemblies from heat, electro-magnetic interference, dirt, vibration, and moisture. Element resistant sleeving products include: • Automotive wire harnesses and hoses; • Abrasion protection and wire management of cable assemblies; • Dielectric protection of electrical leads; • Thermal and mechanical protection of hose assemblies; and • Acoustic insulating and sound-dampening materials.

Industry
The automotive light vehicle market, as well as the medium and heavy-duty commercial market, is comprised of two primary segments: the OE market in which our products are used in the manufacture of new vehicles and OE dealer service parts ("OES"), and the global aftermarket, in which our products are used as replacement parts for all vehicles in operation on the road, including all previous models.
The OE Market. Demand for component parts in the OE market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced, which is driven by macro-economic conditions and other factors such as fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment trends, regulatory requirements, and trade agreements. Although OE demand is tied to planned vehicle production, parts suppliers also have the opportunity to grow through increasing their product content per vehicle, by increasing market share and by expanding into new or emerging markets. Companies with a global presence, leading technology and innovation, and advanced product engineering, manufacturing, and customer support capabilities are best positioned to take advantage of these opportunities.
There are currently several significant trends that are affecting the OE market, including the following:

• | Global Production – The global light and commercial vehicle production in developed markets during 2016 and 2015 was as follows:


 | Global Light and Commercial Vehicle Production
 | 2016 | 2015
 | (millions of vehicles) 
Americas | 21.1 | 21.3
EMEA | 24.3 | 23.3
Asia | 50.2 | 46.5

While global OE production increased at a moderate pace, the demand for parts, including products produced by us also increased moderately during 2016 due to solid demand in the Americas and Asia.

• | Automotive Supply Consolidation – Consolidation within the automotive supply base is expected to continue as the entire industry evolves and as the industry responds to the need to achieve economies of scale and global capabilities to serve vehicle manufacturers who are increasingly global in their production. Suppliers will seek opportunities to achieve synergies in their operations through consolidation, while striving to acquire complementary businesses to improve global competitiveness or to strategically enhance a product offering to global customers.


• | Globalization of Automotive Industry – OEs are increasingly designing global platforms where the basic design of the vehicle is performed in one location, but the vehicle is produced and sold in numerous geographic markets to realize significant economies of scale by limiting variations across product designs and geographic regions. While developed markets in North America and Europe continue to remain important to OEs, increased focus is being placed upon expanded design, development, and production within emerging markets for growth opportunities, especially in India

and China. As a result, suppliers must be prepared to provide product and technical resources in support of their customers within these emerging markets. Furthermore, OEs are moving their operations to best cost geographies outside the U.S. and Western European markets and, accordingly, OEs are increasingly requiring suppliers to provide parts on a global basis. Finally, the Asian OEs continue to expand their reach and market share in relation to traditional North American and European manufacturers. As this trend is expected to continue into the foreseeable future, suppliers must be geographically and technically positioned to meet the needs of the Asian OEs.

• | Focus on Fuel Economy, Reduced Emissions and Alternative Energy Sources – Increased fuel economy and decreased vehicle emissions are of great importance to OEs as legislators and customers continue to demand more efficient and cleaner operating vehicles. Increasingly stringent fuel economy standards and environmental regulations are driving OEs to focus on new technologies including downsized, higher output and turbocharged gasoline engines, diesel and turbocharged diesel, bio-mass and hybrid diesel applications, and hybrid electric and alternative energy engines. As a result, the number of powertrain configurations will increase in response to the proliferation of commercially available energy sources. Suppliers offering solutions to OEs related to numerous vehicle fuel and powertrain configurations possess a distinct competitive advantage, which is driving accelerated new product development cycles.


• | Focus on Vehicle Safety – Vehicle safety continues to receive industry attention by OEs as customers view safety as a fundamental driver in consumer purchasing decisions and legislation looks on improved vehicle safety as a public health issue. Accordingly, OEs are seeking suppliers with new technologies, capabilities, and products that have the ability to advance vehicle safety. Suppliers that are able to enhance vehicle safety through innovative products and technologies have a distinct competitive advantage.


• | Pricing Pressures – OEs provide extensive pricing incentives and financing alternatives to consumers in order to generate sales of new vehicles and retain or gain market share. These actions, coupled with the increasing content required to meet regulations, have placed pressures on the OEs’ profits and, in turn, the OEs expect certain recovery from their supply base. Suppliers must continually identify and implement product innovation and cost reduction activities to fund customer annual price concession expectations in order to retain current business as well as to be competitively positioned for future new business opportunities.


• | Raw Material Cost Fluctuations – There have been significant fluctuations in recent periods in global prices of aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, platinum, resins, steel, other base raw materials, and energy. Suppliers must continue to identify leading design and innovative technological solutions and material substitution options in order to retain a competitive advantage to the extent cost increases are not passed on to customers.


• | Energy, Industrial and Transport Markets – Customers continue to develop alternatives to historic infrastructure in the energy, industrial, and transport markets. This includes power generators and other power conversion devices as well as growth in the aerospace and high speed railway markets, and ocean transport. Suppliers with the capability to utilize automotive expertise to service these and other related markets have a competitive advantage.

The Aftermarket Business. Products for the global vehicle aftermarket are sold directly to a wide range of distributors, retail parts stores, and mass merchants that distribute these products to professional service providers, “do-it-yourself” consumers, and in some cases, directly to service chains. Demand for aftermarket products historically has been driven by three primary factors: (i) the number of vehicles in operation; (ii) the average age of vehicles in operation; and (iii) vehicle usage trends. These factors, while applicable in all regions, vary depending on the composition of the car parc and other factors, which are discussed in greater detail below:

• | Number of Vehicles in Operation – The global vehicle population is expected to grow to 1.4 billion by 2021 and 2.0 billion by 2040. Growth in certain emerging markets, such as China, is increasing at the highest rate, while more mature markets are expected to continue to remain stable or to grow modestly in size, indicating new car sales are well beyond the replacement rate for scrapped vehicles.


• | Increase in Average Age of Vehicles – The average age of vehicles on the road in the U.S. has increased since 2002 from 9.6 years to an estimated 11.6 years in 2016. It is expected to increase to 11.8 years by 2019. The average age of vehicles on the road in Europe has also steadily increased over the past decade to 9.7 years with a slight increase projected through 2020. These trends will drive the need for maintenance and repair work, thereby increasing the overall demand for aftermarket replacement parts in both markets. The average age of vehicles on the road in China is just under five years and is expected to increase to over six years by 2020. We believe this will lead to continuing significant growth in the China aftermarket.

12


• | Channel Consolidation – In the more mature markets of the U.S. and Western Europe, there has been increasing consolidation in aftermarket distribution networks with larger, more sophisticated aftermarket distributors and retailers gaining market share. These distributors generally require larger, more sophisticated suppliers with product expertise, category management capabilities, supply chain services and capabilities, as well as a global manufacturing and sourcing footprint.


• | Growth of Online Capabilities – Reaching consumers directly through online capabilities, including e-commerce, is expected to have an increasing effect on the global aftermarket industry and how aftermarket products are sold. Establishment of a robust online presence will be critical for suppliers regardless of whether they intend to participate directly in e-commerce. In 2015, Motorparts devoted significant resources to improving its online capabilities, in both customer-facing and internal applications, including a new online order management system, vendor management system, customer relationship management ("CRM"), global brand websites, and data and analytics. Initiatives to improve Motorparts online capabilities continued in 2016.


• | Increase in Private Label Brands and Low-Cost Country Imports – In the U.S., there has been an increase in private label or store brands sold by retailers and distributors at a lower price point than premium brands of the same products. However, in many cases, retailers or wholesale distributors creating private label brands will still rely on established suppliers, like Motorparts, to manufacture their private label products and, in some cases, utilize co-branding to support their private label offerings. Motorparts will continue to invest in product innovation and marketing to support the differentiation of its branded product lines.


• | Changes in Consumer Behavior – The aftermarket is affected by changes in economic conditions, volatility in fuel prices, and expanding focus on environmental and energy conservation. For example, the number of consumers with the ability to purchase new vehicles during the 2008-2010 economic downturns led to increased demand for repairs in order to keep older vehicles road-worthy. Increased environmental regulation will lead to additional replacement parts being required on a more frequent basis to meet more exacting standards.

Customers
We supply OEs with a wide variety of technologically innovative parts, substantially all of which are manufactured by us. Our OE customers consist of automotive, light, medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicle manufacturers as well as agricultural, off-highway, marine, railroad, aerospace, high performance, and power generation and industrial application manufacturers. We have well-established relationships with substantially all major American, European, and Asian automotive OEs.
Our aftermarket customers include independent warehouse distributors who redistribute products to local parts suppliers, distributors of heavy-duty vehicular parts, engine rebuilders, retail parts stores, and mass merchants. The breadth of our product lines, the strength of our leading brand names, marketing expertise, sizable sales force, and distribution and logistics capability are central to the success of our Motorparts operations.
No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales during 2016.
Competition
The global vehicular parts business is highly competitive. We compete with many independent manufacturers and distributors of component parts globally. In general, competition for sales is based on price, product quality, technology, delivery, customer service, and the breadth of products offered by a given supplier. We are meeting these competitive challenges by developing leading technologies, efficiently integrating and expanding our manufacturing and distribution operations, widening our product coverage within our core businesses, restructuring our operations and transferring production to best cost countries, and utilizing our worldwide technical centers to develop and provide value-added solutions to our customers. A summary of our primary independent competitors by reporting segment is set forth below.

• | Powertrain – Primary competitors include AGM Automotive, Art Metal, Bergmann, BinZou, Bleistahl, Bosch, Daido, Dana, Dana-Reinz, Delfingen, Denso, DongYang, ElringKlinger, FNOK, Freudenberg, Kaco/Sabo, Kolbenschmidt, Mahle, Miba, NGK, NOK, NPR, Relats, Sinteron, SKF, Taiho, and Vitrica.

Backlog
For OE customers, we generally receive purchase orders for specific products supplied for particular vehicles. These supply relationships typically extend over the life of the related vehicle, subject to interim design and technical specification revisions, and do not require the customer to purchase a minimum quantity. In addition to customary commercial terms and conditions, purchase orders generally provide for annual price reductions based upon expected productivity improvements and other factors. Customers typically retain the right to terminate purchase orders, but we generally cannot terminate purchase orders. OE order fulfillment is typically manufactured in response to customer purchase order releases, and we ship directly from a manufacturing location to the customer for use in vehicle production and assembly. Accordingly, our manufacturing locations turn finished goods inventory relatively quickly, producing from on-hand raw materials and work-in-process inventory within relatively short manufacturing cycles. Significant risks to us include a change in engine production, driven by mix changes, for powertrain components (e.g. a change from diesel to gasoline engines), lower than expected vehicle or engine production by one or more of our OE customers, or termination of the business based upon perceived or actual shortfalls in delivery, quality or value.
For our global aftermarket customers, Motorparts generally establishes product line arrangements that encompass substantially all parts offered within a particular product line. In some cases, Motorparts will enter into agreements with terms ranging from one to three years that cover one or more product lines with fixed prices. Pricing is market responsive and subject to adjustment based upon competitive pressures, material costs, and other commercial factors. Global aftermarket order fulfillment is largely performed from finished goods inventory stocked in our worldwide distribution network. Inventory stocking levels in our distribution centers are established based upon historical and anticipated future customer demand.
Although customer programs typically extend to future periods, and although there is an expectation we will supply certain levels of OE production over such periods, we believe outstanding purchase orders and product line arrangements do not constitute firm orders. Firm orders are limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment. Firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible after receipt from the conversion of available raw materials and work-in-process inventory for OE orders, and from current on-hand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders. The dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the time frame involved.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
We purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in our manufacturing processes, including ferrous and non-ferrous metals, non-metallic raw materials, stampings, castings, and forgings. We also purchase parts manufactured by other manufacturers for sale in the aftermarket. We have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials, components or finished parts and normally do not carry inventories of raw materials or finished parts in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules. In 2016, no outside supplier provided products that accounted for more than 5% of our annual purchases.
Insight Portfolio Group LLC - Related Party
Insight Portfolio Group, LLC (“Insight”) is an entity formed and controlled by Mr. Icahn in order to maximize the potential buying power of a group of entities with which Mr. Icahn has a relationship in negotiating with a wide range of suppliers of goods, services, and tangible and intangible property at negotiated rates. The Company acquired a minority equity interest in Insight and agreed to pay a portion of Insight’s operating expenses beginning in 2013. In addition to the minority equity interest held by the Company, certain subsidiaries of IEP and other entities with which Mr. Icahn has a relationship also acquired equity interests in Insight and also agreed to pay certain operating expenses. Our payments to Insight were less than $0.5 million in 2016 and 2015. 
Related Parties
On June 1, 2015, a subsidiary of IEP completed an acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Uni-Select USA, Inc. and Beck Arnley Worldparts, Inc., comprising the U.S. automotive parts distribution of Uni-Select Inc. ("Uni-Select"). Subsequent to the acquisition, Uni-Select changed its name to Auto Plus. Auto Plus is operated independently from us and all transactions are approved by independent directors of our company. In connection with the acquisition, Mr. Icahn has resigned from our board of directors and our Co-Chief Executive Officer, Daniel A. Ninivaggi, has resigned from the board of directors of IEP.
We had $54 million of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 to Auto Plus and $11 million of accounts receivable, net outstanding from Auto Plus as of December 31, 2016.

On February 3, 2016, a subsidiary of IEP acquired a majority of the outstanding shares of Pep Boys - Manny, Moe & Jack ("Pep Boys"), a leading aftermarket provider of automotive service, tires, parts, and accessories across the U.S. and Puerto Rico. On February 4, 2016, the acquisition of the remaining outstanding shares of Pep Boys was completed. 
We had $39 million of sales from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2016 to Pep Boys and $25 million of accounts receivable, net outstanding from Pep Boys as of December 31, 2016. 
PSC Metals, Inc. (“PSC Metals”) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of IEP. We had scrap sales to PSC Metals of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
On December 1, 2016, we acquired the assets and liabilities of IEH BA LLC ("Beck Arnley"), an entity owned by a subsidiary of IEP. The purchase price was $14 million and included a $7 million note maturing on May 1, 2018. 
Seasonality of Our Business
Our business is moderately seasonal because many North American OE customers typically close assembly plants for two weeks in July for model year changeovers, and for an additional week during the December holiday season. OE customers in Europe historically shut down vehicle production during portions of July and August and one week in December. Shut-down periods in the Rest of World generally vary by country. The aftermarket experiences seasonal fluctuations in sales due to demands caused by weather and driving patterns. Historically, our sales and operating profits have been the strongest in the second quarter. For additional information, refer to our quarterly financial results contained in Note 22, Supplementary Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited), to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this report.
Employee Relations
We have approximately 53,000 employees as of December 31, 2016. Various unions represent approximately 31% of our U.S. hourly employees and approximately 83% of our non-U.S. hourly employees. With the exception of two facilities in the U.S., most of our unionized manufacturing facilities have their own contracts with their own expiration dates and, as a result, no contract expiration date affects more than one facility.
Effect of Environmental Regulations 
Our operations, consistent with those of the manufacturing sector in general, are subject to numerous existing and proposed laws, and governmental regulations designed to protect the environment, particularly regarding plant wastes and emissions, and solid waste disposal. Capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment for environmental control activities did not have a material effect on our financial position or cash flows in 2016 and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or cash flows in 2017.
Intellectual Property
We hold in excess of 6,300 patents and patent applications on a worldwide basis, of which more than 1,200 have been filed in the U.S. Of the approximately 6,300 patents and patent applications, approximately 30% are in production use and/or are licensed to third parties, and the remaining 70% are being considered for future production use or provide a strategic technological benefit to us.
We do not materially rely on any single patent, nor will the expiration of any single patent materially affect our business. Our current patents expire over various periods into the year 2036. We are actively introducing and patenting new technology to replace formerly patented technology before the expiration of the existing patents. In the aggregate, our worldwide patent portfolio is materially important to our business because it enables us to achieve technological differentiation from our competitors.
We also maintain more than 6,700 active trademark registrations and applications worldwide. More than 90% of these trademark registrations and applications are in commercial use by us or are licensed to third parties.
Segment Reporting Data
Operating segment data and principal geographic area data for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 are summarized in Note 21, Operations by reporting segment and geographic area, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 1.A. RISK FACTORS 
An investment in Federal-Mogul involves various risks. The risks discussed below are not the only ones faced by the Company. Please also read the cautionary note regarding “Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 2.
The Company has substantial indebtedness, which could restrict the Company’s business activities and could subject the Company to significant interest rate risk: As of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $3.0 billion of outstanding indebtedness. The Company is permitted by the terms of its debt instruments to incur additional indebtedness, subject to the restrictions therein. The Company’s inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, or to refinance its debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms, including approximately $700 million of term loan indebtedness that matures in 2018, would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, covenants in the Company’s debt agreements could limit its ability to engage in certain transactions and pursue its business strategies, which could adversely affect liquidity.
The Company’s indebtedness could:

• | limit the Company’s ability to borrow money for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other corporate purposes, guarantee additional debt or issue redeemable, convertible of preferred equity;


• | limit the Company’s ability to make distributions or prepay its debt, incur liens, enter into agreements that restrict distributions from restricted subsidiaries, sell or otherwise dispose of assets (including capital stock of subsidiaries), enter into transactions with affiliates and merger consolidate or sell substantially all of its assets;


• | require the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow to payments on indebtedness, which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development, and other corporate requirements;


• | increase the Company’s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and


• | limit the Company’s ability to respond to business opportunities.

A significant portion of the Company’s indebtedness accrues interest at variable rates. To the extent market interest rates rise, the cost of the Company’s debt would increase, adversely affecting the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
The Company’s restructuring activities and strategic initiatives may affect the Company’s short-term liquidity and may not result in the anticipated synergies and cost savings: The Company is pursuing a number of organic and inorganic growth activities, restructuring plans, and strategic initiatives to increase and improve the Company’s business and profitability. Management believes these activities will enhance the Company’s long term shareholder value; however, the investment to effectuate these activities may have an effect on the Company’s short term liquidity and may create the need for additional borrowing which may be at higher interest rates given the Company’s current level of indebtedness. In addition, it is possible the achievement of expected synergies and cost savings associated with the Company’s restructuring activities will require additional costs or charges to earnings in future periods. It is also possible the expected synergies or returns from strategic initiatives may not be achieved. Any costs or charges could adversely affect the business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.
The Company’s operations in foreign countries expose the Company to risks related to economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, import/export restrictions, regulatory and other risks: As a global business operating in a time of increasing global economic and political instability, we are exposed to global market risks, the consequences of which cannot always be anticipated or quantified. One example is the recent decision of voters in the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union (referred to as “Brexit”). While any ultimate effects of Brexit on the Company are difficult to predict (particularly given the potentially lengthy negotiation period to accomplish a formal withdrawal), because we currently conduct business in the United Kingdom and in Europe, the results of the referendum and any eventual withdrawal could cause disruptions and create uncertainty for our businesses, including affecting our relationships with our customers and suppliers, and could also alter the relationship among currencies, including the value of the British Pound relative to the US Dollar. Such disruptions and uncertainties could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Any ultimate effects of Brexit on the Company will also depend on whether the UK negotiates to retain access to European Union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. The failed coup attempt in Turkey, a country in which the Company has various ownership and economic interests, is another example of a recent global political development for which any potential consequences for the Company are uncertain. These and other developments may increase volatility in the results our operations and may adversely affect our financial condition.
The Company has manufacturing and distribution facilities in many countries. International operations are subject to certain risks including:
17


• | exposure to local economic conditions;


• | exposure to local political conditions (including the risk of seizure of assets by foreign governments);


• | currency exchange rate fluctuations (including, but not limited to, material exchange rate fluctuations, such as devaluations) and currency controls


• | export and import restrictions;


• | restrictions on ability to repatriate foreign earnings;


• | labor unrest; and


• | compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local laws prohibiting inappropriate payments.

The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on the Company are unpredictable and vary from country-to-country.
Certain of the Company’s operating entities report their financial condition and results of operations in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (including, but not limited to, Brazilian real, British pound, Chinese yuan renminbi, Czech crown, euro, Indian rupee, Mexican peso, Polish zloty, Russian ruble, South Korean won, and Swedish krona). In reporting its consolidated statements of operations, the Company translates the reported results of these entities into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates. As a result, fluctuations in the dollar against foreign currencies will affect the value at which the results of these entities are included within Federal-Mogul’s consolidated results.
The Company is exposed to a risk of gain or loss from changes in foreign exchange rates whenever the Company, or one of its foreign subsidiaries, enters into a purchase or sales agreement in a currency other than its functional currency. While the Company reduces such exposure by matching most revenues and costs within the same currency, changes in exchange rates could affect the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.
Changes in tax law or trade agreements and new or changed tariffs could have a material adverse effect on us: Changes in U.S. political, regulatory and economic conditions and/or changes in laws and policies governing U.S. tax laws, foreign trade (including trade agreements and tariffs), manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where the Company or our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business.
The Company conducts operations through joint ventures which may contain various contractual restrictions and require approval for certain actions by our joint venture partners: Certain of the Company’s operations, including emerging markets, are conducted through joint ventures and strategic alliances. With respect to these joint ventures, the Company may share ownership and management responsibilities with one or more partners that may not share the same goals and objectives. Operating a joint venture requires the Company to operate the business pursuant to the terms of the agreement that was entered into with the joint venture partners, as well as to share information and decision making. Additional risks associated with joint ventures include one or more partners failing to satisfy contractual obligations, conflicts arising between the joint venture partners, a change in the ownership of any of the joint venture partners and our limited ability to control compliance with applicable rules and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and related rules and regulations. Additionally, the Company’s ability to sell its interest in a joint venture may be subject to contractual and other limitations. Accordingly, any such occurrences could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
The Company may pursue acquisitions or other affiliations that involve inherent risks, any of which may cause the Company not to realize anticipated benefits, and the Company may have difficulty integrating the operations of any companies that may be acquired, which may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations: In the past, the Company has grown through acquisitions, and may engage in acquisitions in the future as part of the Company’s business strategy. The full benefits of these acquisitions, however, require integration of manufacturing, administrative, financial, sales, and marketing approaches and personnel. If the Company is unable to successfully integrate its acquisitions, it may not realize the benefits of the acquisitions, the financial results may be negatively affected, or additional cash may be required to integrate such operations.
In the future, the Company may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition or affiliation opportunities or complete any particular acquisition, combination, affiliation or other transaction on acceptable terms. The Company’s identification of suitable acquisition candidates and affiliation opportunities and the integration of acquired business operations involve risks inherent in assessing the values, strengths, weaknesses, risks, and profitability of these opportunities. This includes the effects on the Company’s business, diversion of management’s attention, and risks associated with unanticipated problems or unforeseen liabilities, and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be used for the ongoing development of the Company’s business.
18

The difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations, integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures. These difficulties could be further increased to the extent the Company pursues acquisition or affiliation opportunities internationally. The Company may not be effective in retaining key employees or customers of the combined businesses. The Company may face integration issues pertaining to the internal controls and operations functions of the acquired companies and also may not realize cost efficiencies or synergies that were anticipated when selecting the acquisition candidates. The Company may experience managerial or other conflicts with its affiliation partners. Any of these items could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.
The Company’s failure to identify suitable acquisition or joint venture opportunities may restrict the Company’s ability to grow its business. If the Company is successful in pursuing future acquisitions or other affiliations, the Company may be required to expend significant funds, incur additional debt and/or issue additional securities, which may materially adversely affect its results of operations. If the Company spends significant funds or incurs additional debt, the Company’s ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline and the Company may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures.
Impairment charges relating to the Company’s goodwill and long lived assets could adversely affect its financial performance: The Company has been required to recognize impairment charges for its goodwill and other long lived assets. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company periodically assesses these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of these assets, changes in the structure of our business, divestitures, market capitalization declines, or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments may adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized. 
Adverse conditions in the automotive market adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and exposes the Company to credit risks of its customers: The revenues of the Company’s operations are closely tied to global OE automobile sales, production levels, and independent aftermarket parts replacement activity. The OE market is characterized by short-term volatility, with overall expected long-term growth in global vehicle sales and production. Automotive production in the local markets served by the Company can be affected by macro-economic factors such as interest rates, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment trends, regulatory and legislative oversight requirements and trade agreements. A variation in the level of automobile production would affect not only sales to OE customers but, depending on the reasons for the change, could affect demand from aftermarket customers. In addition, aftermarket demand is affected by various factors, including the size and composition of the vehicle population and vehicle usage. The Company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if the Company fails to respond in a timely and appropriate manner to changes in the demand for its products or if the Company is not able to timely identify or address financial distress of its aftermarket customers.
Accounts receivable potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk. The Company’s customer base includes virtually every significant global automotive manufacturer, numerous Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and a large number of distributors and installers of automotive aftermarket parts. Consolidation in the automotive aftermarket may lead to financial distress for financially weaker customers of the Company which, coupled with payment terms that are typically longer than in the OE market, could have a negative effect on the Company’s financial results.
Consolidation, increased market power, and potential conflicts with the Company’s independent aftermarket customers could negatively affect the Company’s financial performance: The Company’s independent aftermarket customers are continuing to consolidate and gain purchasing power and the ability to demand extended payment terms and other pricing concessions. If these trends continue, the financial results of the Company’s Motorparts business segment could be negatively affected. In addition, certain of the Company’s strategic initiatives, including the Company’s strategy of supporting its branded products, strategy of supporting new distribution channels and enhancing its distribution and category management capabilities, or the Company’s strategic affiliation with certain competitors, may not align with the interest of customers.  As a result, aftermarket customers may reduce their business with the Company based on perceived channel conflict.
Cybersecurity risks and other cyber incidents could result in disruption: Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow. The Company depends on information technology systems.  In addition, the Company collects, processes and retains certain sensitive and confidential customer information in the normal course of business. Despite the security measures in place and any additional measures that may be implemented in the future, the Company’s facilities and systems, and those of its third-party service providers, could be vulnerable to security breaches, computer viruses, lost or misplaced data, programming errors, human errors, acts of vandalism or other events. Any disruption of our systems or security breach or event resulting in the misappropriation, loss or other 
19

unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, whether by the Company directly or its third-party service providers, could damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our business or otherwise affect the Company’s results of operations.
The Company is subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties: The Company engages in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies, letters of credit, credit line agreements, financial derivatives, and investment management agreements involving various counterparties. The Company is subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to discharge its obligations under such contracts.
The automotive industry is highly competitive and the Company’s success depends upon its ability to compete effectively in the market: The Company operates in an extremely competitive industry, driven by global vehicle production volumes and part replacement trends. Business is typically awarded to the supplier offering the most favorable combination of cost, quality, technology, and service. In addition, customers continue to require periodic price reductions that require the Company to continually assess, redefine and improve its operations, products, and manufacturing capabilities to maintain and improve profitability. In addition, the Company’s competitors’ efforts to increase their market share could exert additional downward pressure on product pricing and margins. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to compete effectively in the automotive market.
The Company’s pension obligations and other postretirement benefits could adversely affect the Company’s operating margins and cash flows: The automotive industry, like other industries, continues to be affected by the rising cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits. In addition, the Company sponsors certain defined benefit plans worldwide that are underfunded and will require cash payments. If the performance of the assets in the pension plans does not meet the Company’s expectations, or other actuarial assumptions are modified, the Company’s required contributions may be higher than it expects. See Note 15. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this report.
We are a wholly owned subsidiary and therefore could be subject to strategic decisions of Icahn Enterprises, L.P. (“IEP”): We are fundamentally affected by our relationship with IEP. As a wholly owned subsidiary of IEP we could be subject to a wide range of possible decisions which IEP may make from time to time, and circumstances affecting IEP could affect us. Significant changes in IEP’s overall strategy or its relationship with us or material adverse changes in IEP’s performance could have a material adverse effect on us. 
If the Company loses any of its executive officers or key employees, the Company’s operations and ability to manage the day-to-day aspects of its business may be materially adversely affected: The Company’s future performance substantially depends on its ability to retain and motivate executive officers and key employees, both individually and as a group. If the Company loses any of its executive officers or key employees, which have many years of experience with the Company and within the automotive industry and other manufacturing industries, or is unable to recruit qualified personnel, the Company’s ability to manage the day-to-day aspects of its business may be materially adversely affected. The loss of the services of one or more executive officers or key employees, who also have strong personal ties with customers and suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The Company does not currently maintain “key person” life insurance.
Certain disruptions in supply of and changes in the competitive environment for raw materials could adversely affect the Company’s operating margins and cash flows: The Company purchases a broad range of materials, components, and finished parts. The Company also uses a significant amount of energy, both electricity and natural gas, in the production of its products. A significant disruption in the supply of these materials, supplies, and energy or the failure of a supplier with whom the Company has established a single source supply relationship could decrease production and shipping levels, materially increase operating costs and materially adversely affect profit margins. Shortages of materials or interruptions in transportation systems, labor strikes, work stoppages, or other interruptions to or difficulties in the employment of labor or transportation in the markets where the Company purchases material, components, and supplies for the production of products or where the products are produced, distributed or sold, whether as a result of labor strife, war, further acts of terrorism or otherwise, in each case may adversely affect profitability.
In recent periods there have been significant fluctuations in the prices of aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, platinum, resins, steel, other base metals and energy which have had and may continue to have an unfavorable effect on the Company’s business. Any continued fluctuations in the price or availability of energy and materials may have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition. To address increased costs associated with these market forces, a number of the Company’s suppliers have implemented surcharges on existing fixed price contracts. Without the surcharge, some suppliers claim they will be unable to provide adequate supply. Competitive and marketing pressures may limit the Company’s ability to pass some of 
20

the supply and material cost increases on to the Company’s customers and may prevent the Company from doing so in the future. Furthermore, the Company’s customers are generally not obligated to accept price increases the Company may desire to pass along to them. This inability to pass on price increases to customers when material prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than historic levels could adversely affect the Company’s operating margins and cash flow, possibly resulting in lower operating income and profitability.
The Company’s hedging activities to address commodity price fluctuations may not be successful in offsetting future increases in those costs or may reduce or eliminate the benefits of any decreases in those costs: In order to mitigate short-term variation in operating results due to the aforementioned commodity price fluctuations, the Company hedges a portion of near-term exposure to certain raw materials used in production processes, primarily copper, nickel, tin, zinc, high-grade aluminum and aluminum alloy. The results of the Company’s hedging practice could be positive, neutral or negative in any period depending on price changes in the hedged exposures.
The Company’s hedging activities are not designed to mitigate long-term commodity price fluctuations and, therefore, will not protect from long-term commodity price increases. The Company’s future hedging positions may not correlate to actual raw materials costs, which would cause acceleration in the recognition of unrealized gains and losses on hedging positions in operating results.
The Company is subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws, and regulations, and the cost of complying or the Company’s failure to comply with such requirements may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations: The Company is subject to a variety of federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment, the management, use, processing, handling, storage, transport or disposal of hazardous waste materials, or otherwise relating to the protection of public and employee health, safety, and the environment. These laws and regulations expose the Company to liability for the environmental condition of its current facilities, and also may expose the Company to liability for the conduct of others or for the Company’s actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken. These laws and regulations also may expose the Company to liability for claims of personal injury or property damage related to alleged exposure to hazardous or toxic materials in foreign countries. Despite the Company’s intention to be in compliance with all such laws and regulations, the Company cannot guarantee that it will at all times be in compliance with all such requirements. The cost of complying with these requirements may also increase substantially in future years. If the Company violates or fails to comply with these requirements, the Company could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. These requirements are complex, change frequently, and may become more stringent over time, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.
The Company’s failure to maintain and comply with environmental permits the Company is required to maintain could result in fines or penalties or other sanctions and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations or results. Future events, such as new environmental regulations or changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies, newly discovered information or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of products or business activities, may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial conditions, and operations.
New regulations related to “conflict minerals” may force us to incur additional expenses and may make the Company’s supply chain more complex. In August 2012, the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use certain minerals known as “conflict minerals” mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in their products. These new requirements required due diligence efforts in 2013, with initial disclosure requirements beginning in 2014. There will be significant costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in the Company’s products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.
A significant labor dispute involving the Company or one or more of its customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations could adversely affect the Company’s financial performance: A substantial number of the Company’s employees and the employees of the Company’s largest customers and suppliers are members of industrial trade unions and are employed under the terms of various labor agreements. Most of the Company’s unionized manufacturing facilities have their own contracts with their own expiration dates. There can be no assurances that future negotiations with the unions will be resolved favorably or that the Company will not experience a work stoppage or disruption that could adversely affect its financial condition, operating results and cash flows. A labor dispute involving the Company, any of its customers or suppliers or any other suppliers to the Company’s customers or that otherwise affects the Company’s operations, or the inability by the Company, any of its customers or suppliers or any other suppliers to the Company’s customers to negotiate, upon the expiration of a labor agreement, an extension of such agreement or a new agreement on satisfactory terms could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, if any of the Company’s significant customers 
21

experience a material work stoppage, the customer may halt or limit the purchase of the Company’s products. This could require the Company to shut down or significantly reduce production at facilities relating to such products, which could adversely affect the Company’s business and harm its profitability.
The Company is involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s profitability and consolidated financial position: The Company is involved in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that, from time to time, are significant. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, including disputes with suppliers, intellectual property matters, personal injury claims, environmental issues, tax matters and employment matters. No assurances can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s profitability and consolidated financial position.
If the Company is unable to protect its intellectual property and prevent its improper use by third parties, the Company’s ability to compete in the market may be harmed: Various patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws afford only limited protection and may not prevent the Company’s competitors from duplicating the Company’s products or gaining access to its proprietary information and technology. These means also may not permit the Company to gain or maintain a competitive advantage.
Any of the Company’s patents may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. The Company cannot guarantee it will be successful should one or more of its patents be challenged for any reason and countries outside the U.S. may diminish the protection of the Company’s patents. If the Company’s patent claims are rendered invalid or unenforceable, or narrowed in scope, the patent coverage afforded to the Company’s products could be impaired, which could significantly impede the Company’s ability to market its products, negatively affect its competitive position and materially adversely affect its business and results of operations.
The Company’s pending or future patent applications may not result in an issued patent. Additionally, newly issued patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. Courts in the U.S. and in other countries may invalidate the Company’s patents or find them unenforceable. Competitors may also be able to design around the Company’s patents. Other parties may develop and obtain patent protection for more effective technologies, designs or methods. If these developments were to occur, it could have an adverse effect on the Company’s sales. If the Company’s intellectual property rights are not adequately protected, the Company may not be able to commercialize its technologies, products or services and the Company’s competitors could commercialize the Company’s technologies, which could result in a decrease in the Company’s sales and market share and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Company’s products could infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may lead to litigation that could itself be costly, could result in the payment of substantial damages or royalties, and could prevent the Company from using technology that is essential to its products: The Company cannot guarantee its products, manufacturing processes or other methods do not infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Infringement and other intellectual property claims and proceedings brought against the Company, whether successful or not, could result in substantial costs and harm the Company’s reputation. Such claims and proceedings can also distract and divert management and key personnel from other tasks important to the success of its business. In addition, intellectual property litigation or claims could force the Company to do one or more of the following:

• | cease selling or using of any products that incorporate the asserted intellectual property, which would adversely affect the Company’s revenue;


• | pay substantial damages for past use of the asserted intellectual property;


• | obtain a license from the holder of the asserted intellectual property, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; and


• | redesign or rename, in the case of trademark claims, products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may not be possible and could be costly and time-consuming if it is possible to do.

In the event of an adverse determination in an intellectual property suit or proceeding, or the Company’s failure to license essential technology, the Company’s sales could be harmed and its costs could increase, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The Company may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change: Climate change is continuing to receive ever increasing attention worldwide. Many scientists, legislators and others attribute climate change to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which could lead to additional legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The focus on emissions could increase costs associated with the Company’s operations, 
22

including costs for raw materials and transportation. Because the scope of future laws in this area is uncertain, the Company cannot predict the potential effect of such laws on its future consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could affect our ability to timely file reliable financial statements and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. If the Company discovers significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting or at any recently acquired entity, it may adversely affect its ability to provide timely and reliable financial information and satisfy its reporting obligations under federal securities laws.
