ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Overview
 
Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. is an omnichannel retailer offering high quality and differentiated products, and services and solutions for the home and heart-felt life events. These include certain life events that evoke strong emotional connections such as getting married, moving to a new home, having a baby, going to college and decorating a room, which the Company supports through its wedding and baby registries, mover and student life programs, and its design consultation services.
 
The Company commenced operations in 1971 with the opening of two stores, which primarily sold bed linens and bath accessories. The first store carrying a full line of domestics merchandise and home furnishings was introduced in 1985 using the name "Bed Bath & Beyond" in order to reflect the expanded product offering. In 1992, the Company became a public company, with 34 stores, and began trading on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol ‘BBBY.’ In 1999, the Company launched its first e-commerce website, www.bedbathandbeyond.com.
 
Since then, the Company has grown both organically and via acquisition. In 2002, the Company acquired Harmon Stores, Inc., a health and beauty care retailer, which operated 27 stores at the time located in three states. In 2003, the Company acquired Christmas Tree Shops, Inc., a retailer of giftware and household items, which operated 23 stores at the time located in six states. In 2007, the Company acquired Buy Buy Baby, Inc., a retailer of infant and toddler merchandise, which operated eight stores at the time located in four states. In 2007, the Company opened its first international Bed Bath & Beyond store in Ontario, Canada. In 2008, the Company became a partner in a joint venture which operated two stores at the time in the Mexico City market under the name “Home & More,” which were rebranded as Bed Bath & Beyond in 2012. In 2012, the Company acquired Linen Holdings, LLC (“Linen Holdings,” operating as Harbor Linen and T-Y Group), a provider of a variety of textile products, amenities and other goods to institutional customers in the hospitality, cruise line, healthcare and other industries, and Cost Plus, Inc., an omnichannel retailer selling a wide range of home decorating items, furniture, gifts, holiday and other seasonal items, and specialty food and beverages, which operated 258 stores at the time located in 30 states under the names of World Market, Cost Plus World Market or Cost Plus. In 2014, the Company opened its first international buybuy BABY store in Alberta, Canada. In 2015, the Company acquired Of a Kind, Inc., an e-commerce website that features specially commissioned, limited edition items from emerging fashion and home designers. In 2016, the Company acquired One Kings Lane, Inc., an authority in home décor and design offering a unique collection of select home goods, designer and vintage items; PersonalizationMall.com, LLC, an industry-leading online retailer of personalized products; and certain assets of Chef Central, a retailer of kitchenware, cookware and homeware items catering to cooking and baking enthusiasts. In early 2017, the Company acquired Decorist, Inc., an online interior design platform that provides personalized home design services.

Through its multiple retail channels, the Company strives to do more for and with its customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with the Company. The Company operates a robust ecommerce platform consisting of various websites and applications including bedbathandbeyond.com, bedbathandbeyond.ca, harmondiscount.com, facevalues.com, christmastreeshops.com, andthat.com, buybuybaby.com, buybuybaby.ca, harborlinen.com, t-ygroup.com, worldmarket.com, ofakind.com, onekingslane.com, personalizationmall.com, chefcentral.com and decorist.com. The Company also operates an established retail store base which consists of 1,552 stores, as of March 3, 2018, and includes 1,017 Bed Bath & Beyond (“BBB”) stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada, 276 stores under the names of World Market, Cost Plus World Market or Cost Plus (collectively, “Cost Plus World Market”), 119 buybuy BABY (“Baby”) stores in 35 states and Canada, 83 stores under the names Christmas Tree Shops, Christmas Tree Shops andThat! or andThat! (collectively, “CTS”), and 57 stores under the names Harmon, Harmon Face Values or Face Values (collectively, “Harmon”). In addition, the Company is a partner in a joint venture which operates eight stores in Mexico under the name Bed Bath & Beyond.
 
The Company accounts for its operations as two operating segments: North American Retail and Institutional Sales. The Institutional Sales operating segment, which is comprised of Linen Holdings, does not meet the quantitative thresholds under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and therefore is not a reportable segment. Net sales outside of the U.S. for the Company were not material for 2017, 2016 and 2015.
 
Strategy
 
The Company’s mission is to be trusted by its customers as the expert for the home and heart-felt life events. These include certain life events that evoke strong emotional connections such as getting married, moving to a new home, having a baby, going to college and decorating a room, which the Company supports through its wedding and baby registries, mover and student life programs, and its design consultation services. The Company’s ability to achieve its mission is driven by three broad objectives: first, to present a meaningfully differentiated and complete product assortment for the home, of the right quality, at the right value; second, to provide services and solutions that enhance the usage and enjoyment of its offerings; and third, to deliver a convenient, engaging, and inspiring shopping experience that is intelligently personalized over time. The Company is undertaking a number of strategic initiatives to support each of these objectives, as well as to drive change across the organization in order to improve operational efficiencies and to create future growth. Through this focused approach, the Company believes it will further its efforts to be trusted as the expert for the home and heart-felt life events.
 
The integration of retail store and customer facing digital channels allows the Company to provide its customers with a seamless omnichannel shopping experience. In-store purchases are primarily fulfilled from that store’s inventory, or may also be shipped to a customer from one of the Company’s distribution facilities, from a vendor, or from another store. Purchases, including web and mobile, can be shipped to a customer from the Company’s distribution facilities, directly from vendors, or from a store. The Company’s customers can also choose to pick up online orders in a store, as well as return online purchases to a store. Customers can also make purchases through one of the Company’s customer contact centers and in-store through The Beyond Store, the Company’s proprietary, web-based platform. These capabilities allow the Company to better serve customers across various channels.
 
By remaining grounded in its customer-centric culture, along with maintaining strong financial discipline, the Company believes it will achieve its mission to be the trusted expert for the home and heart-felt life events and continue to achieve long-term success.
 
Pricing. The Company believes in offering its customers high quality and differentiated products, and services and solutions at the right price and value. The Company regularly monitors price levels at its competitors in order to ensure that its prices are in accordance with its pricing philosophy. The Company believes that the application of its pricing philosophy is a significant factor in its ability to establish trust among customers as the expert for the home and heart-felt life events.
Merchandising. The Company sells a wide assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings. Domestics merchandise includes categories such as bed linens and related items, bath items and kitchen textiles. Home furnishings include categories such as kitchen and tabletop items, fine tabletop, basic housewares, general home furnishings (including furniture and wall décor), consumables and certain juvenile products. The Company strives to present an exciting and engaging assortment of products to its customers, including name brands, proprietary and exclusive brands, as well as personalized products. The Company pursues product differentiation in several ways, including its own product development, and exclusivity and limited distribution with its vendor partners. Some examples of the Company’s proprietary brands include Wamsutta, Real Simple, SALT and Artisanal Kitchen Supply. The Company, on an ongoing basis, tests new merchandise categories and adjusts the categories of merchandise carried in-store and online and may add new product categories or expand its merchandise assortment as appropriate. Additionally, the Company continues to integrate its merchandise assortments among its concepts.

Associates
 
As of March 3, 2018, the Company employed approximately 65,000 regular full-time and part-time associates. The Company believes that its employee relations are very good and that the labor turnover rate among its management employees is lower than that generally experienced within the industry.
Seasonality
 
The Company’s business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, its sales volumes are higher in the calendar months of August, November and December, and lower in February.
Growth
 
In the 25-year period from the beginning of fiscal 1992 to the end of fiscal 2017, the Company has grown from 34 stores to 1,552 stores, plus its interactive platforms, including websites and applications, and distribution facilities. Total store square footage, net of openings and closings, grew from approximately 0.9 million square feet at the beginning of fiscal 1992 to approximately 43.7 million square feet at the end of fiscal 2017. Over the past several years, sales from the Company’s customer facing digital channels have continued to experience strong growth.
 
In addition, as of March 3, 2018, the Company had distribution facilities totaling approximately 7.2 million square feet, supporting the growth of its customer facing digital channels as well as its stores and its institutional sales segment. During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company’s newest distribution facility in Las Vegas, Nevada began shipping to customers. This new facility replaced a smaller distribution facility in that area, which closed in late 2017, and provides additional capacity to support the growth of the Company’s customer facing digital channels.
 
Over the next several years, the Company expects to make heavy investments in people, processes and technology as it continues the evolution of its foundational structure to support its mission to be trusted by its customers as the expert for the home and heart-felt life events.
 
The Company expects company-wide to open approximately 20 new stores, and close approximately 40 stores in fiscal 2018, unless it can negotiate more favorable lease terms with landlords. Additionally, in connection with leveraging its merchandise offerings and optimizing its operations, the Company continues to expand, across selected stores, the number of specialty departments such as health and beauty care, baby, specialty food, and beverage. Also, the Company is committed to the continued growth of its merchandise categories and channels and is growing the number of items it is able to have shipped directly to customers from a vendor. The continued growth of the Company is dependent, in part, upon the Company’s ability to execute these and other key initiatives successfully.
 
The Company has built its management structure with a view towards its growth and believes that, as a result, it has the necessary management depth.
