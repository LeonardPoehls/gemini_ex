General

SMSA Crane Acquisition Corp. was organized on September 9, 2009 as a Nevada corporation to effect the reincorporation of Senior Management Services of Crane, Inc., a Texas corporation, mandated by the plan of reorganization discussed below.

The Company's emergence from Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code on August 1, 2007 caused a change in majority ownership and voting control - that is, loss of control by the then-existing stockholders, a court-approved reorganization, and a reliable measure of the entity's fair value - resulting in a fresh start, creating, in substance, a new reporting entity. Accordingly, the Company, post-bankruptcy, had no significant assets, liabilities or operating activities. Therefore, the Company is a shell company as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, and Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

On August 29, 2013, Coquí Radio Pharmaceuticals, Corp. ("Coquí" or the "Shareholder") closed a transaction through which Coquí purchased 9,500,000 outstanding shares of common stock and agreed to purchase an additional 400,000 outstanding shares of common stock of the Company from existing shareholders in a private transaction in exchange for $280,000. The additional 400,000 shares were subsequently acquired on October 24, 2013 and Coquí became the majority controlling stockholder of the Company.

The Company was contemplating a possible merger by the Company and Coquí, the Shareholder, however these merger plans were cancelled. The Company's business plan is now to pursue a business combination through the acquisition of, or merger with, an existing company seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly traded corporation. The Company is not restricting its potential target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location. No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company.

During the period from January 2017 to March, 2017, Coqui entered into an Exchange Agreement with 48 investors (Coqui Shareholders) who previously acquired shares of common stock, par value of $0.001 per share of our Company (the SMSA Crane Shares), in a private placement from SMSA Crane, at a price of $3.31 per share. The 48 investors agreed to exchange their SMSA Crane Shares for an equal value of shares of Coquis common stock, par value $0.1 per share (the Coqui Shares), and Coqui agreed to proceed with the proposed exchange. As a result, 1,663,443 SMSA Crane Shares and 151,300 warrants issued to the placement agent were exchanged for Coqui Shares and warrants and were cancelled. 

On April 5, 2017, the Board of Directors approved the cancellation of 1,611,743 SMSA Crane Shares held by the Coqui Shareholders and the cancellation of 51,700 SMSA Crane Shares that were issuable to three Coqui Shareholders but that were not yet issued and recorded as outstanding by the Companys transfer agent as of the date of the Exchange Agreement. 

On May 16, 2017, the Board of Directors approved the issuance of 47,490 shares of its common shares to Coquí, based on the private placement share price of $3.31, in satisfaction for the debt owed to Coqui of $157,195. 

The total number of outstanding shares of the Company, as of the date of this filing, was 10,047,495 common shares and the number of stock warrants outstanding was zero, after the exchange above.
