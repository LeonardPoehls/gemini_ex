--------+---------

General
 CARBO Ceramics Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our” or our “Company”) is a technology company that provides products and services to the global oil and gas and industrial markets to enhance value for its clients.  The Company was incorporated in 1987 in Delaware.  As used herein, “Company”, “CARBO”, “we”, “our” and “us” may refer to the Company and/or its consolidated subsidiaries.
 The Company conducts its business within two operating segments: 1) Oilfield Technologies and Services and 2) Environmental Products and Services.  These two operating segments provide products and services to several market segments in the oil and gas, and the industrial markets.  Financial information about reportable operating segments is provided in Note 13 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 Our Oilfield Technologies and Services segment includes the manufacturing and selling of proppant products for use primarily in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells, FracPro® software for the design of fracture treatments, and StrataGen® consulting services for the optimizing of well completions.  Hydraulic fracturing is the most widely used method of increasing production from oil and natural gas wells.  The hydraulic fracturing process consists of pumping fluids down a natural gas or oil well at pressures sufficient to create fractures in the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation.  A granular material, called proppant, is suspended and transported in the fluid and fills the fracture, “propping” it open once high-pressure pumping stops.  The proppant‑filled fracture creates a conductive channel through which the hydrocarbons can flow more freely from the formation to the well and then to the surface.
 There are three primary types of proppant that can be utilized in the hydraulic fracturing process: sand, resin‑coated sand and ceramic.  Sand is the least expensive proppant, resin-coated sand is more expensive and ceramic proppant is typically the most expensive.  The higher initial cost of ceramic proppant is justified by the fact that its use in certain well conditions results in an increase in the production rate of oil and natural gas, an increase in the total oil or natural gas that can be recovered from the well and, consequently, an increase in cash flow for the operators of the well.  The increased production rates are primarily attributable to the higher strength and more uniform size and shape of ceramic proppant versus alternative materials.  We are one of the world’s largest suppliers of ceramic proppant.
 We manufacture various distinct ceramic proppants.  Our technology suite of ceramic proppants include the following:
  KRYPTOSPHERE® HD is a high-performance ceramic proppant engineered to deliver increased conductivity and durability in the highest closure stress wells.  Even in challenging, high-cost environments such as deep water wells, KRYPTOSPHERE HD retains its integrity and enables greater Estimated Ultimate Recovery (“EUR”) from the reservoir.
 KRYPTOSPHERE LD meets client needs for a lower density proppant than KRYPTOSPHERE HD, yet has similar characteristics and conductivity in high stress wells.
 SCALEGUARD® is a porous ceramic proppant that is infused with scale-inhibiting chemicals and placed throughout the fracture as part of the hydraulic fracturing process.  The infused scale inhibitor in SCALEGUARD is designed to be released into the fracture only on contact with water and thereby reduce or eliminate expensive remedial maintenance programs.  We also are developing SALTGUARD® and PARAGUARD™ to help prevent salt and paraffin wax buildup in wells.
 Our FUSION® technology improves well productivity by forming a stable, high-permeability proppant pack that prevents proppant washout from the non-compressive annulus and near-wellbore areas.
 CARBOAIR® is a high-transport, ultra-low-density ceramic proppant technology that has been developed primarily to increase production and EUR from slickwater fracturing operations. The technology enables exploration and production (“E&P”) operators to avoid the introduction of gel into their fracs while improving reservoir contact and fracture conductivity.
 In addition, we manufacture CARBONRT®, a detectable proppant that utilizes a non-radioactive tracer material to assist operators in determining the locations of fractures in a natural gas or oil well.  This tracer is added to the proppant granules during the manufacturing process, and can be added to most of the types of proppant that the Company sells.
 Our base ceramic suite of products include:
 1


CARBOHSP® and CARBOPROP® are high and intermediate density ceramic proppants, respectively, designed primarily for use in deep oil and natural gas wells.
 CARBOLITE®, CARBOECONOPROP® and CARBOHYDROPROP® are low-density ceramic proppants.  CARBOLITE® is used in medium depth oil and natural gas wells, where higher production rates can be achieved due to the product’s uniform size and spherical shape.  CARBOECONOPROP was introduced to provide a lower cost ceramic to compete more directly with resin-coated sand and sand proppant, and CARBOHYDROPROP was introduced to improve performance in “slickwater” fracture treatments.
 We produce resin-coated ceramic (CARBOBOND LITE®), which addresses a niche market in which oil and natural gas wells are subject to the risk of proppant flow-back.
 Our sand proppants include CARBO NORTHERN-WHITE, which is a frac sand that is used by operators that still value quality, but do not wish to pay the higher costs associated with ceramic or resin-coated proppants.
 Our manufacturing facilities also produce ceramic media for use in various industrial technology applications, including but not limited to the casting and milling markets.  New ceramic media products have been developed specifically for industrial applications expanding our market opportunities outside the oil and natural gas industry.  We also have begun plant trials at our manufacturing facilities to produce products other than ceramic proppant and media for contract manufacturing clients.  Those mineral processing plant trials have proven successful and have led to increased revenue generation.  One example, we recently signed a multi-year contract manufacturing agreement to be the exclusive toll processor for a product in the agricultural industry.
 Through our wholly-owned subsidiary StrataGen, Inc., our Oilfield Technologies and Services segment also promotes increased production and EUR of oil and natural gas by selling one of the most widely used fracture stimulation software under the brand FracPro, and providing fracture design and consulting services to oil and natural gas E&P companies under the brand StrataGen.
 FracPro provides a suite of stimulation software solutions used for designing fracture treatments and for on-site real-time analysis.  Use of FracPro has enabled our clients to recognize and remedy potential stimulation problems.  FracPro has also been integrated with third party reservoir simulation software, furthering its reach and utility.
 StrataGen, our specialized consulting team, works with operators around the world to help optimize well placement, fracture treatment design and production enhancement.  The broad range of expertise of the StrataGen consultants includes: fracture treatment design; completion support; on-site treatment supervision, quality control; post-treatment evaluation and optimization; reservoir and fracture studies; rock mechanics; and software application and training.
 Our Environmental Products and Services segment is intended to protect operators’ assets, minimize environmental risks, and lower lease operating expense (“LOE”).  Asset Guard Products Inc. (“AGPI”), the only wholly-owned subsidiary of ours to operate in this segment, provides spill prevention, containment and countermeasure systems for the oil and gas and industrial industry.   AGPI uses proprietary technology to make products designed to enable its clients to extend the life of their storage assets, reduce the potential for hydrocarbon spills and provide containment of stored materials.  
 Current demand for proppant is extremely dynamic.  Most of our oilfield products and services depend primarily on the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, as well as on the number of natural gas and oil wells drilled, completed or re-completed worldwide.  More specifically, the demand for most of our products and services is dependent on the number of oil and natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured to stimulate production.  The demand for our products and services is also dependent on the commodity price of oil and natural gas, and lower commodity prices result in fewer purchases of our premium products.  In addition, our results of operations are also significantly affected by a host of other factors, including but not limited to (a) rig counts, (b) well completions activity, which is not necessarily correlated with rig count, (c) customer preferences, (d) new product and technology adoption, (e) imports and competition, (f) changes in the product mix of what we sell, (g) costs of developing our products and services and running our business, and (h) changes in our strategy and execution.  
 During the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated approximately 79% of our revenues in the United States and 21% in international markets.
 Competition
 As the demand for ceramic proppant (including proppant produced by us) continued to be negatively impacted by the severe decline in the oil and natural gas industry in 2017, the number of domestic and international competitors in the marketplace continued to decrease, and many of our competitors have shut down plants and/or reduced production.  However, we do not have full visibility as to the extent or duration of these shut-downs and reductions.  One of our worldwide proppant competitors is Saint-Gobain 
 2


Proppants (“Saint-Gobain”).  Saint-Gobain is a division of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, a large French glass and materials company.  Saint-Gobain manufactures a variety of ceramic proppants that it markets in competition with some of our products.  Saint-Gobain’s primary manufacturing facilities are located in Fort Smith and Bauxite, Arkansas.  Saint-Gobain also manufactures ceramic proppant in China.  Mineracao Curimbaba (“Curimbaba”), based in Brazil, also manufactures and markets ceramic proppant in competition with some of our products.  Imerys, S.A., a competitor based in France (“Imerys”), has ceramic proppant manufacturing facilities in Andersonville and Wrens, Georgia and also competes with some of our products.
 We are aware of two major manufacturers of ceramic proppant in Russia.  One of which is FORES Refractory Plant (“FORES”) located in Ekaterinburg, Russia.  Although we have limited information about FORES, we believe that FORES manufactures intermediate-density and low-density ceramic proppant lines and markets its products both inside and outside of Russia.  We are also aware of a large number of manufacturers in China.  Most of these companies produce intermediate-density and low-density ceramic proppants that are marketed both inside and outside of China.  Chinese proppant imports into the United States increased beginning in 2010 and 2011, which contributed to an over-supply of ceramic proppant beginning in 2012.  However, beginning in early 2015, imports declined significantly.
 Our KRYPTOSPHERE product line is replacing both CARBOHSP and CARBOPROP.  Historically, competition for CARBOHSP and CARBOPROP principally includes ceramic proppant manufactured by Saint-Gobain, Curimbaba, as well as various manufacturers located in China.  Our CARBOLITE, CARBOECONOPROP and CARBOHYDROPROP products compete primarily with ceramic proppant produced by Saint-Gobain, Curimbaba and Imerys and with sand-based proppant for use in the hydraulic fracturing of natural gas and oil wells.  At this time, there is not in our view a comparable competitor’s product to our KRYPTOSPHERE product line, which is the subject of patent protection.
 The leading suppliers of mined sand are Unimin Corp., U.S. Silica Company, Fairmount Minerals Limited, Inc., Hi-Crush Partners LP, and Badger Mining Corp.  The leading suppliers of resin-coated sand are Hexion and Santrol, a subsidiary of Fairmount Minerals.
 We believe that some of the significant factors that influence a customer’s decision to purchase our ceramic proppant are (i) reservoir and geological characteristics, (ii) price/performance ratio, (iii) on-time delivery performance, (iv) technical support, (v) proppant availability and (vi) the financial status of E&P operators.  We believe that our products are competitively priced and that our delivery performance is far better than the competition.  Lastly, our superior technical support has enabled us to persuade customers to use our technology products in an increasingly broad range of applications which in turn has increased the overall market for our technology products.
 Product Development
 We continually conduct testing and development activities with respect to alternative raw materials to be used in our existing and alternative production methods.  During 2015, we completed the first line of a plant retrofit to enable production of KRYPTOSPHERE products including both KRYPTOSPHERE LD and KRYPTOSPHERE HD.  We introduced KRYPTOSPHERE HD in 2013, a proppant with greatly increased strength and conductivity when compared to our traditional proppants.  This proppant is intended for use in ultra-high stress wells.  In 2015, we introduced KRYPTOSPHERE LD, a lower density proppant than KRYPTOSPHERE HD.  For information regarding our research and development expenditures, see Note 1 to the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”
 SCALEGUARD, our proppant-delivered, scale-inhibiting technology continues to show positive performance results in multiple basins across North America.  SCALEGUARD has now been successfully used in hundreds of hydraulic fracturing stages.  We are pursuing the development of other infused proppant technologies, some of which underwent field trials in 2016 and 2017.
 Going beyond our existing proppant detection capabilities, we are developing technology for far-field detection of proppant in a fracture, which has shown positive results.
 We are aware of others engaged in the development of alternative products for use as proppants in the hydraulic fracturing process, but are uncertain of the financial status and product viability of these potential competitors.  We believe that while there are potential specialty applications for such products, they will not significantly impact the use of ceramic proppants.  Further, we believe that the “know-how” and trade secrets necessary to efficiently manufacture a product of consistently high quality are difficult barriers to entry to overcome.

Customers and Marketing
 Our clients include both oil and gas customers, and industrial customers.  Our largest customers are participants in the hydraulic fracturing industry.  Specifically, Halliburton Energy Services, Inc. and Keane Group each accounted for more than 10% of our 2017 revenues.  However, the end users of our products are principally the operators of natural gas and oil wells that hire the pressure pumping service companies to hydraulically fracture wells.  We work both with the pressure pumping service companies and with the operators of natural gas and oil wells to present the technical and economic advantages of using ceramic proppant.  We generally supply our customers with products on a just-in-time basis, as specified in individual purchase orders.  Continuing sales of product depend on our direct customers and the operators being satisfied with product quality, availability and delivery performance.  In addition, our ability to increase sales of all of our products depends significantly on a favorable level of activity in the upstream natural gas and oil industries.  We sell our software products and consulting services directly to operators of oil and natural gas wells as well as to service companies involved in hydraulic fracturing.
 We recognize the importance of a technical marketing program in demonstrating long-term economic advantages when selling products and services that offer financial benefits over time.  We have a broad technical sales force to advise end users on the benefits of using ceramic proppant, fracture simulation software, and related consulting services.
 Although originally our ceramic products were intended for use in deeper, higher-stress wells that require high-strength proppant, we believe that there is economic benefit to operators of using ceramic proppant in shallower, lower-stress wells.  We also believe that our new product introductions and education-based technical marketing efforts have enabled us to maintain our position not only as one of the world’s largest suppliers of ceramic proppant but also as a leading innovator in our industry.
 We provide a variety of technical support services and have developed computer software that models the return on investment achievable by using our ceramic proppant versus alternatives in the hydraulic fracturing of a natural gas or oil well.  In addition to the technical marketing effort, from time to time, we engage in field trials to demonstrate the economic benefits of our products and validate the findings of our computer simulations.  Periodically, we provide proppant to operators for field trials on a discounted basis in exchange for their agreement to provide production data for direct comparison of the results of fracturing with ceramic proppant as compared to alternative proppants.
 Our international marketing efforts are conducted primarily through our sales offices in the United Arab Emirates, Canada, Russia, and South America.  Our products and services are used worldwide by U.S. customers operating domestically and abroad, and by foreign customers.  Sales outside the United States accounted for 21%, 34% and 29% of our sales for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The distribution of our international and domestic revenues is shown below, based upon the region in which the customer used the products and services:

Total | $ | 188.8 | | $ | 103.0 | | $ | 279.6

Production Capacity
 We have constructed adequate capacity to support present and foreseeable demand for our ceramic proppant. We continue to incorporate new methods and technologies to reduce our manufacturing costs and make our products more cost-competitive.   As production levels increase, our manufacturing costs per unit tend to decrease.

Stated capacity of our facilities varies based on the mix of products we expect to produce.  The following table sets forth the current stated capacity of each of our existing ceramic manufacturing and other facilities:
 
 
 | Annual | 
----------------------------------------+----------------------+------
Location | Capacity | 
 | (millions of pounds) | 
Eufaula, Alabama | | 245 | * 
McIntyre, Georgia | | 275 | * 
Toomsboro, Georgia | | 1,000 | * 
Millen, Georgia | | 250 | * 
Total ceramic manufacturing capacity | | 1,770 | 
Marshfield, Wisconsin – sand processing | | 1,500 | 
New Iberia, Louisiana – resin-coating | | 330 | **
Total current capacity | | 3,600 | 


* | Given market conditions, our Millen manufacturing facility is currently mothballed and output levels at our Eufaula, McIntyre and Toomsboro facilities are at reduced levels.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


** | Processing activities at the New Iberia facility primarily involve resin-coating of previously manufactured ceramic proppant substrate.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The retrofit of the first production line at our Eufaula, Alabama plant to produce KRYPTOSPHERE was completed in late 2015.  With this retrofit, we can now produce up to approximately 100 million pounds of KRYPTOSPHERE annually.  While this retrofit enables production of our new KRYPTOSPHERE technology products, it did not add additional production capacity.  The retrofit of a second production line at this plant has been deferred until market conditions warrant moving forward with the project.
 During 2017, our overall total ceramic plant utilization, excluding our Russia plant, which we sold in September 2017, was approximately 18% of stated capacity.  Our sand processing plant in Marshfield operated at approximately 82% of its stated capacity during 2017.  We do not expect any significant improvements to our ceramic proppant plant utilization in 2018, except possibly to due to mineral processing growth.  We expect utilization at our sand processing plant to improve during 2018.  Depending on industry conditions, we can modify output levels or idle operations at plants as needed.  Refer to our discussion of impairment considerations in the “Critical Accounting Policies” section of Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Construction of additional manufacturing capacity beyond our existing facilities is not expected in the foreseeable future, and would be dependent on the expected future demand for our products, access to needed capital and the ability to obtain necessary environmental permits.
 Long-Lived Assets by Geographic Area
 Long-lived assets, consisting of net property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangibles, and other long-term assets as of December 31 in the United States and other countries are as follows:
 
 
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | | 2015
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------+-------+------+---+-------+-----
 | ($ in millions) | 
Long-lived assets: | | | | | | | | 
United States | $ | 332.6 | | $ | 496.0 | | $ | 538.8

Total | $ | 339.1 | | $ | 506.2 | | $ | 551.1

Distribution
 We maintain finished goods inventories at each of our manufacturing facilities and at remote stocking facilities.  Our North American remote stocking facilities consist of bulk storage silos with truck trailer loading facilities, as well as rail yards for direct transloading from rail cars to tank trucks.  International remote stocking sites are duty-free warehouses operated by independent owners.  North American sites are typically supplied by rail, and international sites are typically supplied by container ship.  In total, we lease approximately 2,225 rail cars for use in the distribution of our products, of which we have subleased approximately 745 rail cars.  The price of our products sold for delivery in the lower 48 United States and Canada typically includes just-in-time delivery of proppant to the operator’s well site, which eliminates the need for customers to maintain an inventory of ceramic proppant.

Raw Materials 
 Ceramic proppant and ceramic media are made from alumina-bearing ores (commonly referred to as clay, bauxite, bauxitic clay or kaolin, depending on the alumina content) that are readily available on the world market.  The main known deposits of alumina-bearing ores in the United States are in Arkansas, Alabama and Georgia; other economically mineable known deposits are located in Australia, Brazil, China, Gabon, Guyana, India, Jamaica, Russia and Surinam.  Bauxite is largely used in the production of aluminum metal, refractory material and abrasives.  We believe that our ability to purchase bauxite on the open market coupled with our current bauxite inventories will sufficiently provide for our bauxite needs in the United States during 2018.
 Our Eufaula, McIntyre, Toomsboro and Millen facilities primarily use locally mined kaolin for the production of CARBOLITE, CARBOECONOPROP and CARBOHYDROPROP.  We have entered into bi-lateral contracts that require a supplier to sell to us, and require us to purchase from the supplier, at least fifty percent of the Eufaula facility’s and Millen facility’s annual kaolin requirements.  The Eufaula contract runs through May 2020, with an option for us to extend this agreement for additional three year terms.  The Millen contract, which commenced in July 2014, has an initial term of five years with options to extend the agreement for additional five year terms.  Our Millen facility is currently idled.  We have obtained ownership rights in acreage in Wilkinson County, Georgia, which contains in excess of a twelve year supply of kaolin for our Georgia facilities based on full capacity production rates.  We have entered into a long-term agreement with a third party to mine and transport this material at a fixed price subject to annual adjustment.  The agreement requires us to utilize the third party to mine and transport a majority of the McIntyre and Toomsboro facility’s annual kaolin requirement.  Overall, we estimate that our fee simple and leasehold mineral rights in the states of Alabama and Georgia contain approximately 20.1 million tons of kaolin suitable for use in production of our kaolin-based proppants.
 We utilize our own Northern White sand, CARBO NORTHERN-WHITE, and purchase third party wet processed sand reserves for our sand processing facility in Marshfield, Wisconsin, which supplies raw frac sand to the proppant market.
 Ceramic Production Process
 Ceramic proppants are made by grinding or dispersing ore to a fine powder, combining the powder into small pellets and firing the pellets in a rotary kiln.  We use three different methods to produce ceramic proppant.  Industrial ceramic media follows a similar process.
 Our plant in McIntyre, Georgia uses a dry process, which utilizes clay, bauxite, bauxitic clay or kaolin.  The raw material is ground, pelletized and screened.  The manufacturing process is completed by firing the product in a rotary kiln.
 Our plants in Eufaula, Alabama, Toomsboro, Georgia, and Millen, Georgia, use a wet process, which starts with kaolin that is formed into slurry.  The slurry is then pelletized in a dryer and the pellets are then fired in a rotary kiln.
 The portion of our plant in New Iberia, Louisiana that manufactures ceramic proppant, as well as one line at our Eufaula, Alabama facility, uses a new manufacturing process associated with the Company’s KRYPTOSPHERE product line.  
 Our rotary kilns are primarily heated by the use of natural gas.
 Patent Protection and Intellectual Property
 We make ceramic proppant and ceramic media used in foundry and scouring processes (the latter two items comprising a minimal volume of overall sales) by processes and techniques that involve a high degree of proprietary technology, some of which is protected by patents.
 We own multiple patents in the United States and various foreign countries that relate to different types of ceramic proppant and production methods used for ceramic proppant and media; however, depending on market conditions, production of products pursuant to these patents may not necessarily constitute a material portion of our output. We also own multiple U.S. and foreign patents that relate to methods for the detection of subterranean fractures and material, including gravel packs, in the near-borehole region.  We also own multiple U.S. patents that relate to detectable proppant.
 During 2014 and 2015, we obtained three U.S. patents relating to our KRYPTOSPHERE manufacturing process, and during 2017, we obtained one U.S. patent covering the KRYPTOSPHERE product.  We expect these patents to provide assistance in the future sales of this product line.  During 2015, 2016 and 2017, we obtained four U.S. patents relating to our far-field proppant detection products, systems, and methods which relate to our iON™ product line and the QUANTUM™ service line, which are still under development. 
 6


We own multiple U.S. patent applications (together with a number of counterpart applications pending in foreign jurisdictions).  A portion of the U.S. patent applications cover ceramic proppant, detectable proppant, processes for making ceramic proppant and detectable proppant, detection of subterranean fractures, and our GUARDTM, FUSION and AIR™ product lines and methods for making and using these products.  Another portion of the U.S. patent applications cover non-oilfield or industrial products, such as water treatment compositions, foundry media, building materials and ceramic media for use in solar power plants.  The applications are in various stages of the patent prosecution process, and patents may not issue on such applications in any jurisdiction for some time, if they issue at all.
 AGPI (formerly Falcon) owns three U.S. patents, which expire in 2026, 2027 and 2034 and relate to construction of secondary containment areas.  In addition, AGPI owns four U.S. patents, which expire in 2030 and 2031 and relate to polyurea-encapsulated tank bases.  AGPI also owns multiple U.S. patent applications (together with a number of counterpart applications pending in foreign jurisdictions), each of which relates to tank bases or methods of constructing secondary containment areas.
 We believe that our patents have historically been important in enabling us to compete in the market to supply proppant to the natural gas and oil industry.  We intend to enforce, and have in the past vigorously enforced, our patents.  We may from time to time be involved in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of our patent rights.  In addition to patent rights, and perhaps more notably, we use a significant amount of trade secrets, or “know-how,” and other proprietary information and technology in the conduct of our business.  None of this “know-how” and technology is licensed from third parties.  However, we have negotiated a long term license for some third party intellectual property used or jointly developed in connection with our QUANTUM service line.
 Seasonality
 Historically, our business has not been subject to regular material seasonality fluctuations.  However, with the activity in resource plays in the northern and eastern United States, we have experienced higher levels of proppant sales activities during warmer weather periods and less during colder weather months.  In addition, sales activities can be decreased by the spring snow and ice “break-up” in Canada, North Dakota, Montana, and the Northeast U.S., as well as the winter holidays in December and January.
Environmental and Other Governmental Regulations
 We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable domestic and foreign federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations.
 Existing federal environmental requirements such as the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, as amended, impose certain restrictions on air and water pollutants from our operations via permits and regulations.  Those pollutants include volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, storm water and wastewater discharges and other by-products.  In addition to meeting environmental requirements for existing operations, we must also demonstrate compliance with environmental regulations in order to obtain permits prior to any future expansion.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and state programs require covered facilities to obtain individual permits or have coverage under an EPA general permit issued to groups of facilities.  A number of federal and state agencies, including but not limited to, the EPA, the Texas Commission of Environmental Quality, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, the Alabama Department of Environmental Management, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, have environmental regulations applicable to our operations in the states in which we do business.  Historically we have been able to obtain permits, where necessary, to build new facilities and modify existing facilities that allow us to continue compliant operations.  Obtaining these permits in a timely manner will continue to be an important factor in our ability to do so in the future.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 424 employees worldwide.  In addition to the services of our employees, we employ the services of consultants as required.  Our employees are not represented by labor unions.  There have been no work stoppages or strikes during the last three years that have resulted in the loss of production or production delays.  We believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory.

 Forward-Looking Information
 The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a “safe harbor” for forward-looking statements.  This Form 10-K, our Annual Report to Shareholders, any Form 10-Q or any Form 8-K of the Company or any other written or oral statements made by or on behalf of the Company may include forward-looking statements which reflect the Company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance.  The words “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “project”, “estimate”, “forecast”, “plan” or “intend” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, each of which speaks only as of the date the statement was made.  We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  Our forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but that may not prove to be accurate.  All of our forward-looking information is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expected.  Although it is not possible to identify all factors, these risks and uncertainties include the risk factors discussed below.
