Item 1. | BUSINESS

Unless the context otherwise requires, “we”, “us”, “our”, “WestRock” and “the Company” refer to the business of WestRock Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and its partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries. 
General
WestRock is a multinational provider of paper and packaging solutions for consumer and corrugated packaging markets. We partner with our customers to provide differentiated paper and packaging solutions that help them win in the marketplace. Our team members support customers around the world from our operating and business locations in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. We also sell real estate primarily in the Charleston, SC region. 
WestRock was formed on March 6, 2015 for the purpose of effecting the Combination and, prior to the Combination, did not conduct any activities other than those incidental to its formation and the matters contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement. On July 1, 2015, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, RockTenn and MWV completed a strategic combination of their respective businesses and RockTenn and MWV each became wholly-owned subsidiaries of WestRock. RockTenn was the accounting acquirer in the Combination. We believe the Combination combined two industry leaders to create a leading global provider of consumer and corrugated packaging solutions. See “Note 6. Merger, Acquisitions and Investment” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
On May 15, 2016, WestRock completed the Separation, pursuant to which we disposed of our former Specialty Chemicals segment in its entirety and ceased to consolidate its assets, liabilities and results of operations in our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, we have presented the financial position and results of operations of our former Specialty Chemicals segment as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. See “Note 7. Discontinued Operations” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
On April 6, 2017, we completed the HH&B Sale. We used the proceeds from the HH&B Sale in connection with the MPS Acquisition. We recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of HH&B of $192.8 million in fiscal 2017. See “Note 8. Assets Held For Sale” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
On June 6, 2017, we completed the MPS Acquisition. MPS is a global provider of print-based specialty packaging solutions and its differentiated product offering includes premium folding cartons, inserts, labels and rigid packaging. MPS is reported in our Consumer Packaging segment. See “Note 6. Merger, Acquisitions and Investment” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
We report our financial results of operations in three reportable segments: Corrugated Packaging, which consists of our containerboard mill and corrugated packaging operations, as well as our recycling operations; Consumer Packaging, which consists of consumer mills, folding carton, beverage, merchandising displays, home, health and beauty dispensing (prior to the HH&B Sale), and partition operations; and Land and Development, which sells real estate primarily in the Charleston, SC region. In fiscal 2016, we reclassified prior period segment results to align to these segments for all periods presented. Following the Combination and until the completion of the Separation, our financial results of operations had a fourth reportable segment, Specialty Chemicals.
Products
Corrugated Packaging Segment
We are one of the largest integrated producers of containerboard measured by tons produced, and one of the largest producers of high-graphics preprinted linerboard measured by net sales in North America. We have integrated corrugated operations in North America, Brazil and India. We believe we are one of the largest paper recyclers in North America and our recycling operations provide substantially all of the recycled fiber to our mills, as well as to third parties. Our Brazil operations own and operate forestlands that provide virgin fiber to our Brazilian mill.
We operate an integrated corrugated packaging system that manufactures primarily containerboard, corrugated sheets, corrugated packaging and preprinted linerboard for sale to consumer and industrial products manufacturers and corrugated box manufacturers. We produce a full range of high-quality corrugated containers designed to protect, ship, store and display products made to our customers' merchandising and distribution specifications. We convert corrugated sheets into corrugated products ranging from one-color protective cartons to graphically brilliant point-of-purchase packaging. Our corrugated container plants 
7

serve local customers and regional and large national accounts. Corrugated packaging is used to provide protective packaging for shipment and distribution of food, paper, health and beauty and other household, consumer, commercial and industrial products. Corrugated packaging may also be graphically enhanced for retail sale, particularly in club store locations. We provide customers with innovative packaging solutions to promote and sell their products. We provide structural and graphic design, engineering services and custom, proprietary and standard automated packaging machines, offering customers turn-key installation, automation, line integration and packaging solutions. To make corrugated sheet stock, we feed linerboard and corrugating medium into a corrugator that flutes the medium to specified sizes, glues the linerboard and fluted medium together, and slits and cuts the resulting corrugated paperboard into sheets to customer specifications. Our containerboard mills and corrugated container operations are integrated with the majority of our containerboard production used internally by our corrugated container operations. The balance is either used in trade swaps with other manufacturers or sold domestically and internationally. 
Our recycling operations procure recovered paper (also known as recycled fiber) from our converting facilities and from third parties, such as factories, warehouses, commercial printers, office complexes, grocery and retail stores, document storage facilities, paper converters and other wastepaper collectors. We handle a wide variety of grades of recovered paper, including old corrugated containers, office paper, box clippings, newspaper and print shop scraps. We operate recycling facilities that collect, sort, grade, and bale recovered paper and, after sorting and baling, we transfer it to our mills for processing, or sell it principally to U.S. manufacturers of paperboard or containerboard, as well as manufacturers of tissue, newsprint, roofing products and insulation, and to export markets. We also collect small amounts of other products for resale to manufacturers of those products. Our waste services business arranges recycling and waste disposal services for its customers. We operate a nationwide fiber marketing and brokerage system that serves large regional and national accounts, as well as our recycled paperboard and containerboard mills, and sells scrap materials from our converting businesses and mills. Brokerage contracts provide bulk purchasing, often resulting in lower prices and cleaner recovered paper. Many of our recycling facilities are located close to our recycled paperboard and containerboard mills, ensuring availability of supply with reduced shipping costs.
Sales of corrugated packaging products to external customers accounted for 55.5%, 54.6% and 66.4% of our net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See “Note 21. Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, for additional information.
Consumer Packaging Segment
We operate integrated virgin and recycled fiber paperboard mills and consumer packaging converting operations, which convert items such as folding and beverage cartons, displays and interior partitions. Our integrated system of virgin and recycled mills produces paperboard for our converting operations and third parties. We internally consume or sell to manufacturers of folding cartons and other paperboard products our coated natural kraft, bleached paperboard and coated recycled paperboard, and internally consume or sell to manufacturers of solid fiber interior packaging, tubes and cores, book covers and other paperboard products our specialty recycled paperboard. The mill owned by our Seven Hills joint venture in Lynchburg, VA manufactures gypsum paperboard liner for sale to our joint venture partner.
We are one of the largest manufacturers of folding and beverage cartons in North America. We believe we are one of the largest manufacturers of temporary promotional point-of-purchase displays in North America measured by net sales and the largest manufacturer of solid fiber partitions in North America measured by net sales. Our folding and beverage cartons are used to package items such as food, paper, beverages, dairy products, tobacco, confectionery, health and beauty and other household consumer, commercial and industrial products primarily for retail sale. Our folding and beverage cartons are also used by our customers to attract consumer attention at the point-of-sale. We also manufacture express mail packages for the overnight courier industry, provide inserts and labels as well as rigid packaging and other printed packaging products, such as transaction cards (e.g., credit, debit, etc.), brochures, product literature, marketing materials (such as booklets, folders, inserts, cover sheets and slipcases) and grower tags and plant stakes for the horticultural market. For the global healthcare market, we manufacture secondary packages designed to enhance patient adherence for prescription drugs, as well as paperboard packaging for over-the-counter and prescription drugs. Our customers generally use our inserts and labels to provide customer product information either inside a secondary package (e.g., a folding carton) or affixed to the outside of a primary package (e.g., a bottle). Folding cartons typically protect customers’ products during shipment and distribution, and employ graphics to promote them at retail. We manufacture folding and beverage cartons from recycled and virgin paperboard, laminated paperboard and various substrates with specialty characteristics, such as grease masking and microwaveability. We print, coat, die-cut and glue the cartons to customer specifications and ship finished cartons to customers for assembling, filling and sealing. We employ a broad range of offset, flexographic, gravure, backside printing, coating and finishing technologies, as well as iridescent, holographic, textured and dimensional effects to provide differentiated packaging products, and support our customers with new package development, innovation and design services and package testing services. We manufacture and sell our solid fiber and corrugated partitions and die-cut paperboard components 
8

principally to glass container manufacturers and producers of beer, food, wine, spirits, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, and to the automotive industry. 
We design, manufacture and, in many cases, pack temporary displays for sale to consumer products companies and retailers. These displays are used as marketing tools to support new product introductions and specific product promotions in mass merchandising stores, supermarkets, convenience stores, home improvement stores and other retail locations. We also design, manufacture and, in some cases, pre-assemble permanent displays for the same categories of customers. We make temporary displays primarily from corrugated paperboard. Unlike temporary displays, permanent displays are restocked; therefore, they are constructed primarily from metal, plastic, wood and other durable materials. We provide contract packing services, such as multi-product promotional packing and product manipulation, such as multipacks and onpacks. We manufacture and distribute point of sale material utilizing litho, screen, and digital printing technologies. We manufacture lithographic laminated packaging for sale to our customers that require packaging with high quality graphics and strength characteristics.
Sales of consumer packaging products to external customers accounted for 42.8%, 44.6% and 33.2% of our net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See “Note 21. Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, for additional information.
Land and Development Segment
We are responsible for maximizing the value of the various real estate holdings we own that are concentrated in the Charleston, SC region, some of which are held through partnerships. We are in the process of accelerating the monetization of these holdings. Sales in our Land and Development segment to external customers accounted for 1.7%, 0.8% and 0.4% of our net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See “Note 21. Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, for additional information.
Raw Materials
The primary raw materials used by our mill operations are recycled fiber at our recycled paperboard and containerboard mills and virgin fibers from hardwoods and softwoods at our virgin containerboard and paperboard mills. Certain of our virgin containerboard is manufactured with some recycled fiber content. Recycled fiber prices and virgin fiber prices can fluctuate significantly. While virgin fiber prices have generally been more stable than recycled fiber prices, they also fluctuate, particularly during significant changes in weather, such as during prolonged periods of heavy rain or drought, or during housing construction slowdowns or accelerations.

Recycled and virgin paperboard and containerboard are the primary raw materials used by our converting operations. Our converting operations use many different grades of paperboard and containerboard. We supply substantially all of our converting operations' needs for recycled and virgin paperboard and containerboard from our own mills and through the use of trade swaps with other manufacturers. These arrangements allow us to optimize our mill system and reduce freight costs. Because there are other suppliers that produce the necessary grades of recycled and bleached paperboard and containerboard used in our converting operations, we believe we would be able to source significant replacement quantities from other suppliers in the event we incur production disruptions for recycled or virgin paperboard or containerboard. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We May Face Increased Costs or Inadequate Availability of Raw Materials, Energy and Transportation”.
Energy
Energy is one of the most significant costs of our mill operations. The cost of natural gas, coal, oil, electricity and wood by-products (biomass) can fluctuate significantly. In our recycled paperboard mills, we use primarily natural gas and electricity, supplemented with coal and fuel oil to generate steam used in the paper making process and, at a few mills, to generate electricity used on site. In our virgin fiber mills, we use biomass, natural gas and coal to generate steam used in the pulping and paper making processes and to generate some or all of the electricity used on site. We primarily use electricity and natural gas to operate our converting facilities. We generally purchase these products from suppliers at market or tariff rates. See also Item 1. “Business — Governmental Regulation — Environmental and Other Matters” for additional information. See also Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We May Face Increased Costs or Inadequate Availability of Raw Materials, Energy and Transportation”.
9

Transportation
Inbound and outbound freight is a significant expenditure for us. Factors that influence our freight expense are distance between our shipping and delivery locations, distance from customers and suppliers, mode of transportation (rail, truck, intermodal and ocean) and freight rates, which are influenced by supply and demand and fuel costs. The principal markets for our products are in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We May Face Increased Costs or Inadequate Availability of Raw Materials, Energy and Transportation”.
Sales and Marketing
Our top 10 external customers represented approximately 11% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2017. None of these customers individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales. We generally manufacture our products pursuant to customers’ orders. We believe that we have good relationships with our customers. In fiscal 2017, products sold to our top 10 customers by segment represented 16% and 18% of our external sales in our Corrugated Packaging segment and Consumer Packaging segment, respectively. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We Depend on Certain Large Customers”.
As a result of our vertical integration, our mills’ sales volumes may be directly impacted by changes in demand for our packaging products. During fiscal 2017, we sold approximately two-thirds of our coated natural kraft production and approximately one-fifth of our bleached paperboard production to our converting operations, primarily to manufacture folding and beverage cartons, and we sold approximately three-fourths of our containerboard production, including trade swaps and buy/sell transactions, to our converting operations to manufacture corrugated products. Under the terms of our Seven Hills joint venture arrangement, our joint venture partner is required to purchase all of the qualifying gypsum paperboard liner produced by Seven Hills. Excluding the Seven Hills production and our Aurora, IL production converted into book covers and other products, we supplied approximately two-fifths of our specialty recycled paperboard production in fiscal 2017 to our converting operations, primarily to manufacture interior partitions. We have the ability to move our internal sourcing among certain of our mills to optimize the efficiency of our operations.
We market our products primarily through our own sales force. We also market a number of our products through independent sales representatives, independent distributors or both. We generally pay our sales personnel a combination of base salary, commissions and annual bonus. We pay our independent sales representatives on a commission basis. We discuss foreign net sales to unaffiliated customers and other non-U.S. operations financial and other segment information in “Note 21. Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Competition
We operate in a competitive global marketplace and compete with many large, well established and highly competitive manufacturers and service providers. Our business is affected by a range of macroeconomic conditions, including industry capacity changes, global competition, economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad, as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
The industries we operate in are highly competitive, and no single company dominates any of those industries. Our paperboard and containerboard operations compete with integrated and non-integrated national and regional companies operating primarily in North America, and to a limited extent, manufacturers outside of North America. Our competitors include large and small, vertically integrated companies and numerous smaller non-integrated companies. In the corrugated packaging and folding and beverage carton markets, we compete with a significant number of national, regional and local packaging suppliers in North America and abroad. In the solid fiber interior packaging, promotional point-of-purchase display and converted paperboard products markets, we primarily compete with a smaller number of national, regional and local companies offering highly specialized products. Our recycled fiber brokerage and collection operations compete with various other companies for the procurement and supply of recovered paper, including brokers and companies that export recovered paper to international markets. The Land and Development segment competes in the real estate sales and development market, primarily in the Charleston, SC region.
Because all of our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments, we regularly bid for sales opportunities to customers for new business or for renewal of existing business. Our packaging products compete with packaging made from other materials. The primary competitive factors we face include price, design, product innovation, quality and service, with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line and customer preferences. We believe that we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors and we evaluate our performance with annual customer surveys, among other means. 
The businesses we operate in have undergone consolidation. Within the packaging products industry, larger customers, with an expanded geographic presence, have tended to seek suppliers who can, because of their broad geographic presence, efficiently 
10

and economically supply all or a range of their packaging needs. In addition, our customers continue to demand higher quality products meeting stricter quality control requirements. 
See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We Face Intense Competition” and “Risk Factors — We May Be Adversely Affected by U.S. and Worldwide Economic and Financial Market Conditions, and Social and Political Change”.
Governmental Regulation
Health and Safety Regulations
Our operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, including OSHA and related regulations. OSHA, among other things, establishes asbestos and noise standards and regulates the use of hazardous chemicals in the workplace. Although we do not use asbestos in manufacturing our products, ACM is present in some of our facilities. For those facilities where ACM is present, we have established procedures for properly managing the material, including, but not limited to, employee training and work practices to maintain the ACM in good condition and minimize exposure. We do not believe that future compliance with health and safety laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Environmental and Other Matters
Environmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business. We employ manufacturing processes that result in various discharges, emissions and wastes. These processes are subject to numerous federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations, as well as the requirements of environmental permits and similar authorizations issued by various governmental authorities. 
On January 31, 2013, the EPA published a set of four interrelated final rules establishing national air emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants from industrial, commercial and institutional boilers and process heaters, commonly known as “Boiler MACT.” Boiler MACT required compliance by January 31, 2016 or by January 31, 2017 for those mills for which we obtained a prior compliance extension. All work required for our boilers to comply with the rule has been completed. On July 29, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a ruling on the consolidated cases challenging Boiler MACT. The court vacated key portions of the rule, including emission limits for certain subcategories of solid fuel boilers, and remanded other issues to the EPA for further rulemaking. At this time, we cannot predict with certainty how this decision will impact our existing Boiler MACT strategies or whether we will incur additional costs to comply with any revised Boiler MACT standards.
In addition to Boiler MACT, we are subject to a number of other federal, state, local and international environmental rules that may impact our business, including the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, fine particulate matter and ozone for facilities in the U.S. 
We are involved in various administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters that arise in the normal course of business, and may be involved in future matters. Although the ultimate outcome of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty and we cannot at this time estimate any reasonably possible losses based on available information, we do not believe that the currently expected outcome of any environmental proceedings and claims that are pending or threatened against us will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We are Subject to Extensive and Costly Safety and Environmental Laws and Regulation”.
CERCLA and Other Remediation Costs
We face potential liability under federal, state, local and international laws as a result of releases, or threatened releases, of hazardous substances into the environment from various sites owned and operated by third parties at which Company-generated wastes have allegedly been deposited. Generators of hazardous substances sent to off-site disposal locations at which environmental problems exist, as well as the owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons, are liable for response costs for the investigation and remediation of such sites under CERCLA and analogous laws. While joint and several liability is authorized under CERCLA, liability is typically shared with other PRPs and costs are commonly allocated according to relative amounts of waste deposited and other factors.
In addition, certain of our current or former locations are being investigated or remediated under various environmental laws, including CERCLA, and regulations. Based on information known to us and assumptions, we do not believe that the costs of these 
11

projects will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the discovery of contamination or the imposition of additional obligations at these or other sites in the future could result in additional costs.
On January 26, 2009, Smurfit-Stone and certain of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Smurfit-Stone’s Canadian subsidiaries also filed to reorganize in Canada. We believe that matters relating to previously identified third party PRP sites and certain facilities formerly owned or operated by Smurfit-Stone have been or will be satisfied claims in the Smurfit-Stone bankruptcy proceedings. However, we may face additional liability for cleanup activity at sites that are not subject to the bankruptcy discharge, but are not currently identified. Some of these liabilities may be satisfied from existing bankruptcy reserves.
We believe that we can assert claims for indemnification pursuant to existing rights we have under purchase and other agreements in connection with certain of our existing remediation sites. In addition, we believe that we have insurance coverage, subject to applicable deductibles/retentions, policy limits and other conditions, for certain environmental matters. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful with respect to any claim regarding these insurance or indemnification rights or that, if we are successful, any amounts paid pursuant to the insurance or indemnification rights will be sufficient to cover all our costs and expenses. We also cannot predict with certainty whether we will be required to perform remediation projects at other locations, and it is possible that our remediation requirements and costs could increase materially in the future and exceed current reserves. In addition, we cannot currently assess with certainty the impact that future changes in cleanup standards or federal, state or other environmental laws, regulations or enforcement practices will have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
We estimate that we will invest approximately $40 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2018 in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance. It is possible that our capital expenditure assumptions may change, project completion dates may change, and our projections are subject to change due to items such as the finalization of ongoing engineering and implementation work, the EPA determinations on Boiler MACT implementation issues and the outcomes of pending legal challenges to the rules. 
Climate Change
Certain jurisdictions in which we have manufacturing facilities or other investments have taken actions to address climate change. The EPA has issued the Clean Air Act permitting regulations applicable to certain facilities that emit GHG. The EPA also has promulgated a rule requiring certain industrial facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year to file an annual report of their emissions. While we have facilities subject to existing GHG permitting and reporting requirements, the impact of these requirements has not been material to date.
Additionally, the EPA has been working on a set of interrelated rulemakings aimed at cutting carbon emissions from power plants. On August 3, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule establishing GHG emission guidelines for existing electric utility generating units (known as the “Clean Power Plan”). On the same day, the EPA issued a second rule setting standards of performance for new, modified and reconstructed electric utility generating units. While these rules do not apply directly to the power generation facilities at our mills, they have the potential to increase the cost of purchased electricity for our manufacturing operations and change the treatment of certain types of biomass that are currently considered carbon neutral. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay halting implementation of the Clean Power Plan until the pending legal challenges to the rule are resolved. As directed by Executive Order, on April 4, 2017, the EPA issued a proposed rule announcing its intention to review the Clean Power Plan, and, if appropriate, initiate proceedings to suspend, revise or rescind it. A number of states subject to the Clean Power Plan have stopped working on their implementation strategies in response to the litigation and Executive Order; however, certain states where we operate manufacturing facilities have indicated their intention to continue their carbon reduction efforts. On October 16, 2017, the EPA issued a proposed rule that would repeal the Clean Power Plan. Due to ongoing litigation and other uncertainties regarding the Clean Power Plan, its impact on us cannot be quantified with certainty at this time. 
In addition to national efforts to regulate climate change, some U.S. states in which we have manufacturing operations are also taking measures to reduce GHG emissions, such as requiring GHG emissions reporting or developing regional cap-and trade programs. California has enacted a cap-and-trade program that took effect in 2012, and includes enforceable compliance obligations that began on January 1, 2013. In July 2017, California extended the cap-and-trade program to 2030. We do not have any manufacturing facilities that are subject to the cap-and-trade requirements in California; however, we are continuing to monitor the implementation of this program as well as proposed mandatory GHG reduction efforts in other states. Also, the Washington Department of Ecology has issued a final rule, known as the Clean Air Rule, which limits GHGs from facilities that have average annual carbon dioxide equivalent emissions equal to or exceeding 100,000 metric tons/year and proposes to begin GHG emissions reduction requirements for some regulated entities in 2017. Energy intensive and trade exposed facilities and transportation fuel importers, including our Tacoma, WA mill, are subject to regulation under this program. In September 2016, various groups filed 
12

lawsuits against the Washington Department of Ecology challenging the Clean Air Rule. We are carefully monitoring this litigation to assess its potential impact on our Tacoma operations. On May 16, 2017, the Governor of Virginia issued Executive Directive 11, directing the Secretary of Natural Resources to convene a work group to study and recommend methods to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from electric power facilities and grow the clean energy economy within existing state authority. We have been selected by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality to participate in this work group.
The Paris Agreement established a framework for reducing global GHG emissions. By signing the Paris Agreement, the U.S. made a non-binding commitment to reduce economy-wide GHG emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. Other countries in which we conduct business, including China, European Union member states and India, have set similar GHG reduction targets. The Paris Agreement became effective on November 4, 2016. Although a party to the agreement may not provide the required one-year notice of withdrawal until three years after the effective date, in June 2017, President Trump announced that the U.S. intended to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The governors of New York, California and Washington subsequently announced their intent to form a “climate alliance” to coordinate a state response to climate change. At this time, it is not possible to determine how the Paris Agreement, or any potential U.S. commitments in lieu of those under the agreement, may impact U.S. industrial facilities, including our domestic operations. 
Several of our international facilities are located in countries that have already adopted GHG emissions trading schemes. For example, Quebec has become a member of the Western Climate Initiative, which is a collaboration among California and certain Canadian provinces that have joined together to create a cap-and-trade program to reduce GHG emissions. In 2009, Quebec adopted a target of reducing GHG emissions by 20% below 1990 levels by 2020 and 37.5% from 1990 levels by 2030. In 2011, Quebec issued a final regulation establishing a regional cap-and-trade program that required reductions in GHG emissions from covered emitters as of January 1, 2013. Our mill in Quebec is subject to these cap-and-trade requirements, although the direct impact of this regulation has not been material to date. Compliance with this program and other similar programs may require future expenditures to meet required GHG emission reduction requirements in future years. 
The regulation of climate change continues to develop in the areas of the world where we conduct business. We have systems in place for tracking the GHG emissions from our energy-intensive facilities, and we carefully monitor developments in climate change laws, regulations and policies to assess the potential impact of such developments on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and disclosure obligations.
Patents and Other Intellectual Property
We hold a substantial number of foreign and domestic trademarks, trademark applications, trade names, patents, patent applications and licenses relating to our business, our products and our production processes. Our patent portfolio consists primarily of utility and design patents relating to our products and manufacturing operations. It also includes exclusive rights to substantial proprietary packaging system technology in the U.S. or other licenses obtained from a third party. Our brand name and logo, and certain of our products and services, are protected by domestic and foreign trademark rights. Our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, particularly those relating to our converting operations, are important to our operations as a whole. Our intellectual property has various expiration dates. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We Depend On Our Ability to Develop and Successfully Introduce New Products and/or to Acquire and Retain Intellectual Property Rights”.
Employees
At September 30, 2017, we had approximately 44,800 employees, of which approximately 34,100 were located in the U.S. and Canada and 10,700 were located in Europe, South America, Mexico and Asia/Pacific. Of the approximately 44,800 employees, approximately 31,800 were hourly and approximately 13,000 were salaried. Approximately 13,900 of our hourly employees in the U.S. and Canada are covered by CBAs, which typically have four to six year terms. Approximately 2,500 of our employees in the U.S. and Canada are working under expired contracts and approximately 1,100 of our U.S. and Canada employees are covered under CBAs that expire within one year. Approximately 5,200 of our employees outside the U.S. and Canada are covered by agreements similar to CBAs, which most frequently have four to six year terms. Approximately 2,100 of our employees not based in the U.S. and Canada are working under expired agreements and approximately 1,100 of them are covered under agreements that expire within one year.
While we have experienced isolated work stoppages in the past, we have been able to resolve them and we believe that working relationships with our employees are generally good. While the terms of our CBAs vary, we believe the material terms of the agreements are customary for the industry, the type of facility, the classification of the employees and the geographic location covered.
13

In October 2014, we entered into a master agreement with the USW that applied to substantially all of our legacy RockTenn facilities represented by the USW at that time. The agreement has a six year term and covers a number of specific items, including wages, medical coverage and certain other benefit programs, substance abuse testing and successorship. Individual facilities will continue to have local agreements for subjects not covered by the master agreement and those agreements will continue to have staggered terms. Wage increases specified in the master agreement will not begin until the local facility agreements have been negotiated and ratified. The master agreement permits us to apply its terms to USW employees who work at facilities we acquire during the term of the agreement. The master agreement covers 59 of our U.S. facilities and approximately 6,800 of our employees.
See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We May Be Adversely Impacted By Work Stoppages and Other Labor Relations Matters”.
International Operations
Our operations outside the U.S. are conducted through subsidiaries located in Canada, Mexico, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Sales attributable to non-U.S. operations were 17.6%, 17.1% and 13.5% of our net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, some of which were transacted in U.S. dollars. See “Note 21. Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We are Exposed to Risks Related to International Sales and Operations”.
