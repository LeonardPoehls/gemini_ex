ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

General
We are a publicly traded Delaware limited liability company formed by Cheniere in 2013 to hold its limited partner interests in Cheniere Partners, a publicly traded limited partnership. Our only business consists of owning and holding Cheniere Partners’ limited partner common units, Class B units (“Class B units”) and subordinated units (collectively, the “Cheniere Partners units”), along with cash or other property that we receive as distributions in respect of such units, and, accordingly, our operating results and financial condition are dependent on the performance of Cheniere Partners. Therefore, Cheniere Partners’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, has been included in this filing as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference (the “Cheniere Partners Annual Report”). 
Cheniere Partners is developing, constructing and operating natural gas liquefaction facilities at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, on the Sabine-Neches Waterway less than four miles from the Gulf Coast adjacent to the existing regasification facilities through its wholly owned subsidiary, SPL. The liquefaction of natural gas into LNG allows it to be shipped economically from areas of the world where natural gas is abundant and inexpensive to produce to other areas where natural gas demand and infrastructure exist to economically justify the use of LNG. Cheniere Partners owns and operates the LNG regasification facilities at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal through its wholly owned subsidiary, SPLNG. Cheniere Partners also owns a 94-mile pipeline that interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG terminal with a number of large interstate pipelines through its wholly owned subsidiary, CTPL. 
When Cheniere Partners makes cash distributions to us with respect to the Cheniere Partners units, we will pay dividends to our shareholders consisting of the cash that we receive from Cheniere Partners, less income taxes and reserves established by our Board of Directors (our “Board”). Cheniere Partners has paid the initial quarterly distribution amount of $0.425 per common unit, or $1.70 per common unit on an annualized basis, for each fiscal quarter since its initial public offering in March 2007. Cheniere Partners has not made any cash distributions in respect of the subordinated units with respect to the quarters ended on or after June 30, 2010. 
We have elected to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, an owner of our shares will not report any of our items of income, gain, loss and deduction on its U.S. federal income tax return, nor will an owner of our shares receive a Schedule K-1. Our shareholders also are not subject to state income tax filings in the various states in which Cheniere Partners conducts operations as a result of owning our shares. Like dividends paid by a corporation, dividends received by our shareholders are reported on a Form 1099-DIV and subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as any applicable state or local income tax. 
As of December 31, 2016, we owned a 55.9% limited partner interest in Cheniere Partners and Cheniere owned, indirectly through GP Holdco, the general partner of Cheniere Partners and the incentive distribution rights in Cheniere Partners. In addition, we owned a non-economic voting interest in GP Holdco that allows us to control GP Holdco and the appointment of four of the eleven members to the board of directors of the general partner of Cheniere Partners to oversee the operations of Cheniere Partners. Cheniere owns the sole share entitled to vote in the election of our directors (the “Director Voting Share”). If Cheniere relinquishes the Director Voting Share, which it may do in its sole discretion, or ceases to own greater than 25% of our outstanding shares (a “Cheniere Separation Event”), our non-economic voting interest in GP Holdco would be extinguished and we would cease to control GP Holdco.

Our Business Purpose
Our primary business purpose is to:

• | own and hold the Cheniere Partners units;


• | pay dividends on our shares from the distributions that we receive from Cheniere Partners, less income taxes and any reserves established by our Board to pay our company expenses and amounts due under our services agreement (the “Services Agreement”) with a wholly owned subsidiary of Cheniere to service and reduce indebtedness that we may incur and for company purposes, in each case as permitted by our limited liability company agreement (“LLC Agreement”);


• | simplify tax reporting requirements for investors by issuing a Form 1099-DIV with respect to the dividends received on our shares rather than a Schedule K-1 that would be received as a unitholder of Cheniere Partners; and


• | designate members of the board of directors of Cheniere Partners GP to oversee the operations of Cheniere Partners.

Our Business

Our business consists of owning the following Cheniere Partners units, along with cash or other property that we receive as distributions in respect of such units:
Common Units
We own 11,963,488 common units, which are entitled to quarterly cash distributions from Cheniere Partners. To the extent that Cheniere Partners is unable to pay the initial quarterly distribution in the future, arrearages in the amount of the initial quarterly distribution (or the difference between the initial quarterly distribution and the amount of the distribution actually paid to common unitholders) may accrue with respect to the common units.
Subordinated Units
We own 135,383,831 subordinated units. The subordinated units are not entitled to receive distributions until all common units have received at least the initial quarterly distribution, including any arrearages that may accrue. Cheniere Partners has not made any cash distributions in respect of the subordinated units with respect to the quarters ended on or after June 30, 2010. The subordination period will extend until the first business day following the distribution of available cash to partners in respect of any quarter that each of the following occurs: 

• | distributions of available cash from operating surplus on each of the outstanding common units (assuming conversion of the Class B units), subordinated units and any other outstanding units that are senior or equal in right of distribution to the subordinated units equaled or exceeded the sum of the initial quarterly distributions on all of the outstanding common units (assuming conversion of the Class B units), subordinated units, general partner units and any other outstanding units that are senior or equal in right of distribution to the subordinated units for each of the three consecutive, non-overlapping four-quarter periods immediately preceding that date;


• | the “adjusted operating surplus” (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Cheniere Partners, dated as of August 9, 2012 (the “Partnership Agreement”)) generated during each of the three consecutive, non-overlapping four-quarter periods immediately preceding that date equaled or exceeded the sum of the initial quarterly distributions on all of the outstanding common units (assuming conversion of the Class B units), subordinated units, general partner units and any other outstanding units that are senior or equal in right of distribution to the subordinated units during those periods on a fully diluted basis; and


• | there are no arrearages in payment of the initial quarterly distribution on the common units.

Expiration of the Subordination Period 
When the subordination period expires, each outstanding subordinated unit will convert into one common unit and will then participate pro rata with the other common units in distributions of available cash. In addition, if the Cheniere Partners’ unitholders remove its general partner other than for cause and units held by the general partner and its affiliates are not voted in favor of such removal: 

• | the subordination period will end and each subordinated unit will immediately convert into one common unit;


• | any existing arrearages in payment of the initial quarterly distribution on the common units will be extinguished; and


• | the general partner will have the right to convert its general partner units and its incentive distribution rights into common units or to receive cash in exchange for those interests.

Early Conversion of Subordinated Units 
The subordination period will automatically terminate and all of the subordinated units will convert into common units on a one-for-one basis on the first business day following the distribution of available cash to partners in respect of any quarter that each of the following occurs:

• | in connection with distributions of available cash from operating surplus, the amount of such distributions constituting “contracted adjusted operating surplus” (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) on each outstanding common unit (assuming conversion of the Class B units), subordinated unit and any other outstanding unit that is senior or equal in

3

right of distribution to the subordinated units equaled or exceeded $0.638 (150% of the initial quarterly distribution) for each quarter in the four-quarter period immediately preceding that date;

• | the contracted adjusted operating surplus generated during each quarter in the four-quarter period immediately preceding that date equaled or exceeded the sum of a distribution of $0.638 (150% of the initial quarterly distribution) on all of the outstanding common units (assuming conversion of the Class B units), subordinated units, general partner units, any other units that are senior or equal in right of distribution to the subordinated units, and any other equity securities that are junior to the subordinated units that the board of directors of Cheniere Partners GP deems to be appropriate for the calculation, after consultation with management of Cheniere Partners GP, on a fully diluted basis; and


• | there are no arrearages in payment of the initial quarterly distribution on the common units.

Class B Units
We own 45,333,334 Class B units. The Class B units are not entitled to receive cash distributions except in the event of a liquidation of Cheniere Partners, a merger, consolidation or other combination of Cheniere Partners with another person or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Cheniere Partners. The Class B units are subject to conversion, mandatorily or at the option of the holders of the Class B units under specified circumstances, into a number of common units based on the then-applicable conversion value of the Class B units. On a quarterly basis beginning on the initial purchase date of the Class B units, the conversion value of the Class B units increases at a compounded rate of 3.5% per quarter subject to additional upward adjustment for certain equity and debt financings. As of December 31, 2016, the accreted conversion ratio of the Class B units owned by us and Blackstone CQP Holdco was 1.86 and 1.83, respectively. The Class B units will mandatorily convert into common units on the first business day following the record date of our first distribution after the substantial completion date of Cheniere Partners’ Train 3, but in any case no earlier than the first business day following the record date of our distribution with respect to the quarter ended June 30, 2017. If the Class B units are not mandatorily converted by July 2019, the holders of the Class B units have the option to convert the Class B units into common units at that time. 
The following table (in thousands) illustrates the number of common units into which the Class B units held by us and Blackstone CQP Holdco would convert at the dates specified below and our and Blackstone CQP Holdco’s percentage ownership of then outstanding Cheniere Partners units, assuming that none of the outstanding Class B units are optionally converted prior to the dates set forth in the table and that no additional limited partner interests are issued by Cheniere Partners prior to such dates:

 | December 31, 2017 | December 31, 2018 | July 9, 2019
Cheniere Holdings: | | | 
Number of Common Units | 96,792 | 111,060 | 118,959 
Percentage Ownership | 47.9% | 46.5% | 45.9% 
Blackstone CQP Holdco: | | | 
Number of Common Units | 209,782 | 240,640 | 257,683 
Percentage Ownership (1) | 41.2% | 43.3% | 44.4% 


(1) | This percentage ownership is based solely upon the conversion of Class B units and does not include any common units that may be deemed to be beneficially owned by Blackstone Group, an affiliate of Blackstone CQP Holdco. Based on information from a Schedule 13D/A filed by Blackstone Group and related parties with the SEC on January 15, 2016, Blackstone Group may be deemed to beneficially own 3,758,003 common units. 

Employees

We have no employees and rely on Cheniere, via the Services Agreement, to manage all aspects of the conduct of our business. As of January 31, 2017, Cheniere and its subsidiaries had 911 full-time employees.
