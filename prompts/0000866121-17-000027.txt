Backlog 
Firm backlog is the estimated value of contracts for which orders have been recorded, but for which revenue has not yet been recognized. The total amount of firm backlog was approximately $9.3 billion at December 31, 2016 and $8.3 billion at December 31, 2015. Approximately $2.4 billion of firm backlog was not yet funded at December 31, 2016. We expect that approximately 40% of the December 31, 2016 firm backlog will be recognized as revenue in calendar 2017. 
Total backlog, which includes firm backlog plus the value of unexercised options, was approximately $14.4 billion at December 31, 2016 and $13.0 billion at December 31, 2015.
Seasonality
Our business is not seasonal.
Competition
We compete against other U.S. and foreign prime contractors and subcontractors, many of which have substantially more resources to deploy than we do in the pursuit of government and industry contracts. Our ability to compete successfully in this environment depends on a number of factors, including the creativity and effectiveness of research and development programs, our ability to offer better program performance than our competitors and/or at a lower cost, our readiness with respect to facilities, equipment and personnel to undertake the programs for which we compete, and our past performance and demonstrated capabilities. 
Additional information on the risks related to competition can be found under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A. of this report.
We generally face competition from a number of competitors in each business area, although no single competitor competes along all of our segments. Our principal competitors in each of our segments are as follows:
Flight Systems Group:    Aerojet-Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.; Arianespace SA; Coleman Aerospace, a division of Aerojet-Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.; Daher Group; GKN Aerospace Company; Harris Corporation Aerostructures; HITCO Aerostructures; Kilgore Flares Company, LLC, a subsidiary of Chemring North America; Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc.; Lockheed Martin Corporation; Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems; Space Exploration Technologies Corporation; Spirit Aerosystems Company; United Launch Alliance (a joint venture between Lockheed Martin Corporation and The Boeing Company); and Vought Aircraft, a division of Triumph Aerostructures.
Defense Systems Group:   Aerojet-Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.; BAE Systems, Chemring Group; General Dynamics Corporation; L3 Technologies; Lockheed Martin Corporation; Nammo AS; Northrop Grumman Corporation; Raytheon Company; and various international producers of ammunition and guns.
Space Systems Group: Airbus Defense and Space; Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corp.; Lockheed Martin Corporation; Mitsubishi Electric Corp.; Reshetnev Company - Information Satellite Systems; Sierra Nevada Corporation; Space Exploration Technologies Corporation; Space Systems/Loral, a subsidiary of MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd.; Surrey Satellite Technology Limited, a subsidiary of Airbus Group; Thales Alenia Space; and The Boeing Company.
Research and Development
We conduct extensive research and development ("R&D") activities. Company-funded R&D is primarily for the improvement of current products and for development of next-generation technology. Customer-funded R&D is comprised primarily of activities we conduct under contracts with the U.S. Government and its prime contractors. R&D expenditures were as follows (in millions):

 | Company-funded | | Customer-funded
Year ended December 31, 2016 | $ | 116 | | $ | 396
Nine months ended December 31, 2015 | $ | 83 | | $ | 359
Year ended March 31, 2015 | $ | 49 | | $ | 499

Raw Materials and Components
We use a broad range of raw materials in manufacturing our products, including aluminum, steel, copper, lead, graphite fiber, epoxy resins, zinc and adhesives. We monitor the sources from which we purchase raw materials in an attempt to ensure 
6

there are adequate supplies to support our operations. We monitor the price of materials, particularly commodity metals like copper, which have fluctuated dramatically over the past several years.
We also use sub-assemblies and instruments in our products and obtain parts and equipment that are used in the production of our products or in the provision of our services from domestic and foreign suppliers and the U.S. Government. Generally, we have not experienced material difficulty in obtaining product components or necessary parts and equipment, and we believe that alternatives to our existing sources of supply are available in most cases.
We procure materials and components from a variety of sources. In the case of our government contracts, we are often required to purchase from sources approved by the DoD. When our suppliers choose to eliminate certain materials or components we require from their product offering, we attempt to qualify other suppliers or replacement materials to ensure there are no disruptions to our operations. 
We rely upon sole-source suppliers for many of our satellite and launch vehicle components, including our liquid-propellant rocket engines. The inability of our current suppliers to provide us with key components could result in significant contract delays, cost increases and loss of revenues due to the time, resources and effort that would be required to develop or adapt other engines or components for use in our products. 
Additional information on the risks related to raw materials and components can be found in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this report.
Intellectual Property
At December 31, 2016, we owned 441 U.S. patents and 320 foreign patents. We also had approximately 102 U.S. patent applications and approximately 125 foreign patent applications pending.
Although we manufacture various products covered by patents, we do not believe that any single existing patent, license or group of patents is material to our success. We believe that unpatented research, development and engineering skills also make an important contribution to our business. The U.S. Government typically receives royalty-free licenses to inventions made under U.S. Government contracts. Consistent with our policy to protect proprietary information from unauthorized disclosure, we ordinarily require employees to sign confidentiality agreements as a condition of employment.
As many of our products are complex and involve patented and other proprietary technologies, we face a risk of claims alleging that we have infringed upon third-party intellectual property rights. Such claims could result in costly and time-consuming litigation, the invalidation of our intellectual property rights and/or increased licensing costs.
Regulatory Matters
U.S. Governmental Contracts
We are subject to the procurement policies and procedures set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR"). The FAR governs all aspects of government contracting, including competition and acquisition planning; contracting methods and contract types; contractor qualifications; and acquisition procedures. Every government contract contains a list of FAR provisions that must be complied with in order for the contract to be awarded. The FAR provides for regular audits and reviews of contract procurement, performance and administration. Failure to comply with the provisions of the FAR could result in contract termination.
The U.S. Government may terminate its contracts with its suppliers, either for convenience or in the event of a default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. If a cost-plus contract is terminated for convenience, we are entitled to reimbursement of our approved costs and payment of a total fee proportionate to the percentage of the work completed under the contract. If a fixed-price contract is terminated for convenience, we are entitled to payment for items delivered to and accepted by the U.S. Government, and fair compensation for work performed plus the costs of settling and paying claims by terminated subcontractors, other settlement expenses and a reasonable profit on the costs incurred or committed. If a contract termination is for default, we are paid an amount agreed upon for completed and partially completed products and services accepted by the U.S. Government, and may be liable to the U.S. Government for repayment of any advance payments and progress payments related to the terminated portions of the contract, as well as excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from another source. 
Additional information on the risks related to government contracts can be found in Item 1A,"Risk Factors" of this report.
7

We also must comply with U.S. and foreign laws governing the export of munitions and other controlled products and commodities. These include regulations relating to import-export control, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act.
U.S. Government Contract Security Restrictions
Certain programs with the U.S. Government are prohibited by the customer from being publicly discussed. The consolidated financial statements and financial information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflect the operating results of our entire company, including restricted programs, under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).
Environmental
Our operations are subject to a number of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as applicable foreign laws and regulations that govern the discharge, treatment, storage, remediation and disposal of certain materials and wastes, and restoration of damages to the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations is a responsibility we take seriously. We believe that forward-looking, proper and cost-effective management of air, land and water resources is vital to the long-term success of our business. Our environmental policy identifies key objectives for implementing this commitment throughout our operations. Additional information on the risks related to environmental matters can be found in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this report.
Employees
At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 12,700 employees. We have union-represented employees at five locations, comprising less than 20% of our total workforce.
