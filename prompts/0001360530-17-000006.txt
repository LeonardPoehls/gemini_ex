Item 1.        Business
Overview of our Company
We are a multi-channel specialty retailer and contract manufacturer of vitamins, minerals, herbs, specialty supplements, sports nutrition and other health and wellness products. We market approximately 900 nationally recognized brands as well as our own brands, which include The Vitamin Shoppe®, BodyTech®, True Athlete®, Mytrition®, plnt®, ProBioCare®, Next Step® and Betancourt Nutrition®. We believe we offer one of the largest varieties of products among vitamin, mineral and supplement (“VMS”) retailers and continue to refine our assortment with approximately 7,000 stock keeping units (“SKUs”) offered in our typical store and approximately 10,000 additional SKUs available through e-commerce. Our broad product offering enables us to provide our customers with a depth of selection of products that may not be readily available at other specialty retailers or mass merchants, such as discount stores, supermarkets, drugstores and wholesale clubs. We believe our product offering and emphasis on product knowledge and customer service helps us meet the needs of our target customer and serves as a foundation for enhancing customer loyalty.
We sell our products through three operating segments: retail, direct and manufacturing. In our retail segment, which includes Vitamin Shoppe and Super Supplements retail store formats, we have leveraged our store economic model by opening a total of 137 stores from the beginning of Fiscal Year 2014 through Fiscal Year 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we operated 775 stores located in 45 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, primarily located in retail centers and stand alone locations. In our direct segment, we sell our products directly to consumers through the internet, primarily at www.vitaminshoppe.com. Our e-commerce sites complement our in-store experience by extending our retail product offerings and enable us to access customers outside our retail markets and those who prefer to shop online. Our manufacturing segment provides custom manufacturing and private labeling of VMS products, and develops and markets our own branded products for both sales to third parties and for the VSI product assortment.
During Fiscal 2015, the Company began development of a strategic plan focused on upgrading our customers’ experience across our retail and e-commerce channels, the “reinvention strategy”. The Company worked with outside consultants to analyze qualitative and quantitative information relevant to our customers’ experience. The reinvention strategy is focused on upgrading the customer experience to inspire our target customers with changes to curate our product assortment, opportunities to increase private brands penetration, enhancements to the in-store and digital experience, store layout, as well as changes to improve the effectiveness of our loyalty program. The Company incurred approximately $9.0 million of selling, general and administrative costs during Fiscal 2016 in connection with the reinvention, of which approximately $6.0 million of such costs are expected to be on-going. These costs include additional internal resources, improvements to store network connectivity, and outside consultants. The Company is in the process of testing several initiatives and expects to realize improved financial results from the reinvention beginning in Fiscal 2017. In addition, we have engaged a consulting firm in Fiscal 2016 to identify other efficiencies and cost reduction opportunities focusing on product sourcing, store operations, pricing and promotions, and corporate expenses. During Fiscal 2016, we incurred $3.8 million of costs in connection with identifying other efficiencies and cost reduction opportunities. As a result of this cost reduction project, we have identified savings potential with an estimated value of at least $24.0 million on an annualized basis.
In Fiscal 2015, we also performed a review of certain business operations. As part of this review, the Company implemented changes to more closely align Super Supplements stores with current processes and assortments in the Vitamin Shoppe retail stores. As a result, net costs of $1.8 million and $1.0 million were incurred during Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, respectively. Annual cost savings resulting from these actions are estimated to be $1 million to $2 million. In addition, the Company decided to cease operations in Canada, and as a result net costs of $0.9 million and $1.9 million were incurred in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, respectively. The annual cost savings related to ceasing operations in Canada are estimated to be approximately $1.0 million. Costs for these two initiatives include lease liabilities, markdown charges on inventory and employee severance.

Segment Information
We operate through three business segments: retail, which includes Vitamin Shoppe and Super Supplements retail store formats, direct, which consists of our e-commerce formats, and manufacturing, which consists of the Nutri-Force manufacturing operations. For additional information, refer to Note 15, “Segment and Product Data” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Retail. Through our retail store formats, we believe we differentiate ourselves in the VMS industry. What makes us unique is our broad selection of VMS products and our stores are staffed with trained and knowledgeable employees, who we refer to as Health Enthusiasts®, and who are able to inform our customers about product features and assist in product selection.
Since the beginning of Fiscal 2014 through Fiscal 2016, we have opened 137 stores, expanding our presence in our existing markets as well as entering new markets. In Fiscal 2017, the rate of new store growth and remodeling of existing stores is being further evaluated as part of the reinvention. In addition, our new stores since the beginning of Fiscal 2013 are approximately 2,900 square feet compared to the average of our total store portfolio of approximately 3,500 square feet.
Direct. We sell our products directly to consumers through the internet, primarily at www.vitaminshoppe.com. Our e-commerce sites complement our in-store experience by extending our retail product offerings with approximately 10,000 additional SKUs that are not available in our stores and enable us to access customers outside our retail markets and those who prefer to shop online.
Manufacturing. Through Nutri-Force, we provide custom manufacturing and private labeling of VMS products and develop and market our own branded products for both sales to third parties and for the VSI product assortment.
In conjunction with the Company’s reinvention, we are increasing our focus on customer centric initiatives toward becoming an omni-channel based retailer. As recently launched initiatives, including buy online pickup in store and subscription sales, continue to develop, the interrelationship among the ways customers can purchase products from VSI results in sales that are generated and fulfilled across multiple channels. We believe the historical structure of separate segments for retail stores and e-commerce will no longer be representative of our operating performance. As a result, beginning in Fiscal 2017, the Company will be updating its segment reporting to better align with its omni-channel strategy. These changes include combining the current retail and direct operating segments into one retail operating segment. In addition, certain costs currently classified as corporate costs, such as retail and direct management costs, will be allocated to the retail operating segment. VSI has revised its internal management structure to align with our omni-channel strategy.
Industry
The VMS industry is large, estimated to be approximately $41 billion in 2016 according to the Nutrition Business Journal (“NBJ”), we believe is fragmented, and continued growth is expected as health and wellness trends continue. According to the NBJ, the VMS industry is expected to register a CAGR of 6.2% from 2016 to 2020. Sports supplements and meal replacement categories are projected to post the highest CAGRs at 8.3% and 7.3%, respectively.
Increased focus on healthy diet and nutrition, along with growing fitness and wellness program participation, serves as a positive trend for the nutritional supplements industry. Retailers of VMS products primarily include specialty retailers and mass merchants, such as discount stores, supermarkets, drugstores and wholesale clubs. The specialty retailers typically cater to the more sophisticated VMS customer by focusing on selection and customer service, while the mass merchants generally offer a limited assortment comprised of more mainstream products with less customer service. NBJ anticipates that the specialty retail channel will grow at an average rate of 6.5% through 2020. Additionally, NBJ forecasts the internet channel to grow at an average rate of 10.2% from 2016 to 2020.
Although long-term prospects noted above suggest continued growth, recent trends have created volatility in the near term and we expect continued volatility. Recent industry trends have been mixed, driven in part by the prospects of more federal and state involvement in the industry. A lack of clarity on regulation appears to be dissuading manufacturers from investing in and developing new ingredients/products. Additionally, negative publicity about the nutritional supplement industry has increased over the past few years and adds further uncertainty to the fundamental outlook. With product innovation remaining slower than in past years, and negative headlines/media at heightened levels, VMS industry headwinds appear poised to persist over the near term.
6


Over recent years, there has been a shift of market share from specialty retailers to other channels such as mass market retailers, club chains, drugstore chains and e-commerce companies. This broader competitive channel availability of VMS products represents a challenge for VSI to keep pace with industry growth rates. 
Industry and market data contained or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K were obtained through company research, surveys and studies conducted by third parties and industry and general publications or based on our experience in the industry. We have not independently verified market and industry data from third-party sources.
Competitive Strengths
We believe there is an opportunity to capitalize on the VMS industry dynamics, and we plan to further develop the following competitive strengths as part of the foundation of our reinvention strategy:
Value-Added Customer Service. We believe we offer a high degree of customer service. We place a strong emphasis on employee training and customer service, and view our Health Enthusiasts as a source for health and wellness information while assisting our customers with their product selections.
Product Selection, Including a Strong Assortment of Private Brands. We believe we have a broad merchandise assortment. We complement our assortment with our private brands merchandise which accounted for approximately 21% of our net sales in Fiscal 2016.
Attractive Customer Base. We have a large base of customers who proactively manage their health and wellness through the use of vitamins and supplements. In Fiscal 2016, 86% of our net sales (excluding Nutri-Force net sales) were attributable to our Healthy Awards customers. Our no-fee Healthy Awards Program promotes brand loyalty among our customers and allows our customers to earn points redeemable for future purchases, approximately 66% of which were redeemed in Fiscal 2016. We also utilize our Healthy Awards Program database to track customer purchasing patterns across our retail and direct business segments, analyze market and industry trends and create targeted merchandising and marketing strategies. In Fiscal 2016, we announced enhancements to this program, including the issuance of certificates on a quarterly basis.
Highly Refined Real Estate Strategy. We apply demanding criteria to our retail site selection. We locate our stores primarily in attractive stand-alone locations or endcap (corner) positions in retail centers. We believe that the location and visibility of our real estate is an important component of our customer acquisition strategies.
Multi-Channel Retailer. We are a multi-channel retailer, distributing products through our retail stores and our e-commerce sites, enabling us to access customers outside our retail markets and those who prefer to shop online. This business model affords us multiple touch points of interaction with our customers, which allows us to gather data and communicate with them in person, through our call center and via the internet.
Experienced Management Team with Proven Track Record. We have assembled a management team across a broad range of disciplines with extensive experience in building leading national specialty retailers.
Business Strategy
 We intend to pursue the following key strategies in order to execute our reinvention strategy:

• | Upgrading our Customers’ Shopping Experience – We are focusing on enhancing both our in-store and digital experience. This will include improvements to our store layout, the remodeling of stores, changes to our product assortment, increasing the penetration of private brands and continuing to enhance the features and functionality of our e-commerce sites and providing our customers with a more personalized shopping experience;


• | Building Relationships – To enhance relationships with our customers including improving the utilization of our Health Enthusiasts, customer relationship management program, website and mobile functionality, in order to personalize our relationship and gain a greater share of their discretionary spending;


• | Store and Comparable Sales Growth – To increase sales and profitability of our existing store base as well as continue opening new stores in the future. We are further evaluating changes to our store format in order to enhance our customers’ shopping experience;


• | Cost Reduction Initiatives – To improve operating performance through initiatives focused on reducing costs in areas such as product sourcing, promotions and various other reductions to selling, general and administrative expenses; 


• | Private Brands – We are focused on the development of new private brands and the extension of existing private brands to establish a point of differentiation for our customers; and


• | Vertical integration – The acquisition of the manufacturing operations of Nutri-Force allows us to better control the production and timing of new product introductions and should enhance profitability. We intend to focus on increasing

the portion of the VSI private brands assortment manufactured by Nutri-Force in order to leverage capacity, and implement a series of initiatives designed to improve the financial performance of Nutri-Force.
Store Counts and Locations
We plan to open approximately 15 new stores in Fiscal 2017 and the rate of new store growth and remodeling of existing stores is being further evaluated as part of the reinvention strategy. The following table shows the change in our network of stores for the Fiscal Years 2012 through 2016:

New stores have typically required approximately four to five years to mature, generating lower store level sales in the initial years than our mature stores. As a result, new stores generally have a negative impact on our overall operating margin. In addition, our new stores since the beginning of Fiscal 2013 are approximately 2,900 square feet compared to the average of our total store portfolio of approximately 3,500 square feet. As these stores mature, we expect them to contribute positively to our operating results. The following table reflects our store count by state, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico at December 31, 2016:

As of December 31, 2016, we leased the property for all of our 775 stores. Our typical lease terms are ten years, with one or two five-year renewal options. We do not believe that any individual store property is material to our financial condition or results of operations. Of the leases for our stores, 30 expire in Fiscal 2017, 95 expire in Fiscal 2018, 107 expire in Fiscal 2019, 95 expire in Fiscal 2020, 94 expire in Fiscal 2021 and the balance expire in Fiscal 2022 or thereafter. For the majority of our leases, renewal options remain available.
Products
We organize our products by category enabling comparisons between different brands within each product sub-category. In addition, our stores are staffed with experienced and knowledgeable Health Enthusiasts, many of whom are regular and informed VMS consumers. Our Health Enthusiasts are equipped with tablets to inform our customers about product features and assist our customers in product selection. To further inform our customers, our stores are equipped with Aisle 7®, an independent source of health and wellness information.
We offer a comprehensive selection of vitamins, minerals, herbs, homeopathic remedies, specialty supplements such as fish oil, probiotics, glucosamine and Co Q10, sports nutrition, weight management, as well as natural bath and beauty products. Our offering includes approximately 17,000 SKUs from approximately 900 brands, including our own brands such as The Vitamin Shoppe®, BodyTech®, True Athlete®, Mytrition®, plnt®, ProBioCare®, Next Step® and Betancourt Nutrition®

brands which include products such as Ultimate Man, Ultimate Woman, Ultimate 10 Probiotic, Whey Tech and Whey Tech Pro 24 Proteins. We also offer a comprehensive assortment from leading national brands such as Optimum Nutrition®, Cellucor®, Garden of Life®, Quest Nutrition®, Solaray®, Solgar® and Nature’s Way®. This extensive assortment is designed to provide our customers with a unique selection of available products to help them achieve their health and wellness goals. Sales of our branded products accounted for approximately 21% of our net sales in Fiscal 2016.

Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs and Homeopathy
Vitamins and minerals are recommended to maintain health, proactively to improve health and in support of specific health conditions. These products help prevent nutrient deficiencies that can occur when diet alone does not provide all the necessary vitamins and minerals our bodies need. The vitamin and mineral product category includes multi-vitamins, which many consider to be a foundation of a healthy regimen, lettered vitamins, such as Vitamins A, C, D, E, and B-complex, along with major and trace minerals such as calcium, magnesium, chromium and zinc.
Herbs offer a natural remedy to address specific conditions. Certain herbs help support specific body systems, including ginkgo to support brain function and milk thistle to help support liver function, as well as other less common herbs such as black cohosh for menopause support. Herbal products include whole herbs, standardized extracts, herb combination formulas and teas. Homeopathic remedies offer our customers the ability to address health concerns while providing the safety of having no known drug interactions or side effects.
With approximately 6,500 SKUs in this product category, a wide range of potency levels and multiple delivery systems, our customers have many choices to fit their individual needs.
Sports Nutrition
Our sports nutrition consumers are looking for products to help maintain or supplement a healthy lifestyle. These products are used in conjunction with cardiovascular conditioning, weight training and sports activities. Major categories in sports nutrition include protein and weight gain powders, meal replacements, weight management, and pre and post-workout supplements to either support energy production or enhance recovery after exercise. Our sports nutrition products are offered in many convenient forms, such as powders, tablets, capsules, soft gels and liquids. Our sports nutrition consumers include the sports enthusiast, weekend warrior, endurance athlete, marathoner, serious bodybuilder, as well as those seeking to maintain a healthy fitness level. We offer approximately 2,000 SKUs in sports nutrition.
Specialty Supplements
Specialty supplements help supply higher levels of nutrients than diet alone can provide, help individuals stay healthy, and support specific conditions and life stages such as childhood, pregnancy, menopause and aging. Categories of specialty supplements include omega fatty acids, probiotics and condition specific formulas. Certain specialty supplements, such as 
10


organic greens, psyllium fiber and soy proteins, provide added support during various life stages. Folic acid is specifically useful during pregnancy. Super antioxidants, such as coenzyme Q-10, grapeseed extract and pycnogenol, address specific conditions. High ORAC (oxygen radical absorptive capacity) fruit concentrates such as; gogi, mangosteen, pomegranate and blueberry help prevent oxygen radical damage. Other specialty supplement formulas are targeted to support specific organs, biosystems and body functions. We offer approximately 4,500 SKUs of specialty supplements.
Other
Our “Other” category represents all other product classifications we stock that are not included within the previously described categories. These products include items such as on the go bars, drinks and snacks, natural beauty and personal care. Our on the go bars, drinks and snacks offer our customers access to an offering of protein, low carb and natural bars, protein, energy and functional beverages and natural snacks. Natural beauty and personal care products offer an alternative to traditional products that often contain synthetic and/or other ingredients that our customers find objectionable. Our customers choose these products over more traditional products because they contain organic and natural ingredients, are free of pesticides or not tested on animals and/or are more closely aligned with the health and wellness goals of our customers. We offer approximately 4,000 SKUs for our Other category. In Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, our Other product category includes net merchandise sales to third parties of Nutri-Force of $50.0 million, $56.6 million and $40.3 million, respectively.
Delivery Revenue
Delivery revenue represents amounts billed to customers for shipping fees.
Access to New Products
One of the many components of customer satisfaction is the introduction of new products. We identify customer and market trends by listening to our customers, Health Enthusiasts, vendors, contract manufacturers and market influencers. We maintain active partnerships with our vendors to stay on top of their product offerings and to bring new products to our customers quickly. In addition, we have a knowledgeable team in-house who focuses on bringing new Vitamin Shoppe branded products to our offering. Each year we launch many new products under our own brands, including the launch in Fiscal 2016 of approximately 60 new products. These include new product expansions into sustained release proteins and Isotech 42 ready to drink clear proteins in our BodyTech® brand, and the expansion of our plnt® brand with the addition of key items such as protein based meal replacement powders, mushroom immune formula and adaptogenic herb formulas.
Manufacturing
Through Nutri-Force, we provide custom manufacturing and private labeling of VMS products and develop and market our own branded products for both sales to third parties and for the VSI product assortment. Our manufacturing operations, which are located in Miami Lakes, Florida, produce tablets, capsules, soft-gels and powders. By operating our own manufacturing facilities, we believe we have the ability to better control the production and timing of new product introductions, and maintain high standards of product quality.
Suppliers and Inventory
The Company had one supplier from whom we purchased at least 5% of our merchandise during Fiscal 2016, two suppliers from whom we purchased at least 5% of our merchandise during Fiscal 2015 and one supplier from whom we purchased at least 5% of our merchandise during Fiscal 2014. We purchased approximately 11% of our total merchandise from these suppliers during Fiscal 2016 and approximately 17% during Fiscal 2015 and 12% during Fiscal 2014.
We consider numerous factors in supplier selection, including, but not limited to, quality, price, credit terms, and product offerings. As is customary in our industry, we generally do not have long-term contracts with any supplier and most suppliers may discontinue selling to us at any time.
We strive to maintain sufficient inventory to enable us to provide a high level of service to our customers. Inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable levels, payment terms and return policies are in accordance with standard business procedures. We maintain a distribution network which we use in conjunction with a just-in-time inventory ordering system that we use to replenish our stores based upon customer demand of a given product or products. Our working capital requirements for merchandise inventory will continue to increase as we continue to open additional stores and expand our distribution network. Currently, our practice is to establish an inventory level of approximately $145,000 at cost for each of our stores, the cost of which is partially offset by vendor incentive and allowance programs. Additionally, 30 day payment terms have been extended to us by some of our suppliers allowing us to effectively manage our inventory and working capital. We believe that our buying power enables us to receive favorable pricing terms and enhances our ability to obtain high demand merchandise.
11


Warehouse and Distribution
We operate our supply chain primarily from two Company operated distribution center facilities. The Company operates distribution centers in North Bergen, New Jersey and Ashland, Virginia. By operating our own facilities we gain greater control over operations and costs. Our products manufactured by Nutri-Force are warehoused and distributed through its Miami Lakes, Florida facilities. 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to lease a warehousing and distribution facility located in Avondale, Arizona, which we expect to open before the end of Fiscal 2017. We previously utilized a third-party logistics provider to service the west coast, and we believe operating our own facility will provide improved service levels and network efficiencies. 
Regulatory and Quality Control
The Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) is the regulatory authority charged with overseeing the products we offer and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) regulates the advertising of those products.
Our Scientific and Regulatory Affairs (“S&RA”) and Legal departments review all aspects of our Company’s FDA and FTC regulatory processes, ensuring compliance with regulations. We have established processes to review the underlying safety and efficacy of our branded products, including The Vitamin Shoppe®, BodyTech®, True Athlete®, Mytrition®, plnt®, ProBioCare®, Next Step® and Betancourt Nutrition®. These processes include review of the ingredients’ safety information, product formulation, product form, product labeling, the efficacy and claim support for the product and any marketing materials. All consumer communications that deal with product and health issues must be approved by S&RA prior to being disseminated to the public.
We have standard procedures whereby all potential Vitamin Shoppe contract manufacturers are reviewed and approved before they can supply any of our branded products. In addition, all potential new products are evaluated and approved prior to being accepted into our branded product lines.
Our relationships with manufacturers require that all of our branded products not be adulterated or misbranded under any provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and the regulations promulgated thereunder. This includes, but is not limited to, compliance with applicable Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”). This means that ingredients in our products must be tested for identity, purity, quality, strength, and composition before being incorporated into our branded products, and that our final branded products must again be tested for identity, purity, quality, strength, and composition prior to being released. All of these products require a certificate of analysis, which includes certification to 100% of label claim.
We have established a standard quality control operating procedure that calls for on-site audits of our contract manufacturers’ facilities and processes, and have established an internal team that will audit each of these facilities and work with our contract manufacturers to resolve any noncompliance with dietary supplement cGMP regulations. We require that our manufacturers have certificates of analysis (such as for microbial testing and label testing).
Third party vendors, are also subject to a standard review, must comply with our vendor purchase agreement, including guaranteeing that all third-party products are lawful and manufactured in compliance with applicable cGMPs, and are required to carry adequate insurance policies to satisfy our standards. Each new product proposed to be carried by us is reviewed by our S&RA department. They reject those products that they believe may present undue risk or be unsafe.
Healthy Awards Program
Our Healthy Awards Program, which we established over 15 years ago, encourages our customers to make repeat purchases and enables us to enhance customer loyalty. The program is free of charge to join, and members earn one point for every dollar they spend, and points are accumulated toward a credit certificate which can be applied to a future purchase. Beginning in Fiscal 2016, the Company implemented enhancements to the program, including the issuance of credit certificates on a quarterly basis compared with annual issuances under the previous program. We enrolled approximately 2.1 million new members in Fiscal 2016. The number of active members between retail and online shoppers was approximately 6.3 million as of December 31, 2016. An active member is a customer that has purchased an item within the last twelve months.
We utilize our Healthy Awards Program database to track customer purchasing patterns across our retail and direct business segments, analyze market and industry trends and create targeted merchandising and marketing strategies. In addition, it provides us with customer and demographic data we use to assist us in the selection of future store locations.
12


Marketing
We believe our high quality real estate is one of our primary marketing tools, as we locate our stores in high-visibility areas. We also conduct targeted marketing efforts by sending promotional offers to members of our Healthy Awards Program, and we continue to develop our digital marketing and social media strategies. We advertise in national magazines, and engage in local advertising via direct mail, radio and television for certain new stores.
We promote our own branded products, including The Vitamin Shoppe®, BodyTech®, True Athlete®, Mytrition®, plnt®, ProBioCare®, Next Step® and Betancourt Nutrition® through our retail channel by placing the products in strategic and highly visible locations in our stores.
Competition
The U.S. nutritional supplements retail industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Competition is based primarily on quality, product assortment, price, customer service, convenience, marketing support and availability of new products. We compete with publicly and privately owned companies with broad geographical market coverage and product categories. We compete with other specialty and mass market retailers, including GNC®, Whole Foods®, Natural Grocers®, Sprouts Farmers Market®, Vitamin World®, Costco® and other club chains, Wal-Mart®, drugstore chains including Rite-Aid®, CVS® and Walgreens®, internet and mail order companies, including Amazon.com®, Puritan’s Pride®, Vitacost.com®, Bodybuilding.com®, Doctors Trust®, Swanson® and iHerb®, in addition to a variety of independent health and vitamin stores and e-commerce outlets.
Insurance and Risk Management
We purchase insurance to partially offset standard risks in our industry, including policies to cover products liability, travel liability, auto liability and other casualty and property risks. We are self-insured and utilize high deductible programs for certain losses related to our employee medical benefits, workers’ compensation and general liability, although we maintain stop-loss coverage with third-party insurers to limit our liability exposure. Our insurance rates are based on our safety record, claims experience and trends in the insurance industry.
We face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if, among other things, the use of our products results in injury. With respect to product liability coverage, we carry insurance coverage typical of our industry and product lines. Our coverage involves self-insured retentions with primary and excess liability coverage above the retention amount. We have the ability to refer certain claims to our contract manufacturers, third-party vendors and their respective insurers to pay the costs associated with any claims arising from those contract manufacturers’ or third-party vendors’ products. Our insurance covers claims that are not adequately covered by a contract manufacturer’s or third-party vendor’s insurance and provides for excess secondary coverage above the limits provided by our contract manufacturers or third-party vendors. We believe we have obtained a prudent amount of insurance for the insurable risks associated with our business. Our experience is that our insurance costs have increased in the past, and may increase in the future.
Tradenames and Other Intellectual Property
We believe trademark protection is particularly important to the maintenance of the recognized proprietary brand names under which we market our products. We own trademarks or trade names that we use in conjunction with the sale of our products, including The Vitamin Shoppe®, BodyTech®, True Athlete®, Mytrition®, plnt®, ProBioCare®, Next Step® and Betancourt Nutrition® brand names. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our intellectual property rights through a variety of methods including trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and others who have access to our proprietary information. Protection of our intellectual property often affords us the opportunity to enhance our position in the marketplace by precluding our competitors from using or otherwise exploiting our technology and brands. The carrying value of our trademarks and brands, which are primarily indefinite lived intangible assets, was $78.9 million at December 31, 2016 and $79.5 million at December 26, 2015.
Sales from International Sources
For each of the last three years, less than 1.0% of our sales have been derived from international sources.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 3,887 full-time and 1,616 part-time employees, of whom 4,334 were employed in our retail channel and 1,169 were employed in corporate, manufacturing, distribution and direct channel support

functions. None of our employees belong to a union or are a party to any collective bargaining or similar agreement except for certain employees at one of our Seattle based stores, who are members of the United Food & Commercial Workers Local No. 367. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
Environmental
We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing our operations, including the handling, transportation and disposal of our products and our non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water and groundwater. Failure to comply with those laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties or the imposition of other liabilities. Changes in environmental laws or the interpretation thereof or the development of new facts could also cause us to incur additional capital and operational expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws and regulations. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment without regard to fault or knowledge about the condition or action causing the liability. Under certain of these laws and regulations, such liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of previously owned or operated properties. The presence of contamination from those substances or wastes could also adversely affect our ability to utilize our leased properties. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect upon our earnings or financial position; however, if we violate any environmental obligation, it could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance.
Government Regulation
The formulation, manufacturing, processing, labeling, packaging, advertising and distribution of our products are subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including the FDA, the FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). These activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. The FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) regulates the processing, formulation, safety, manufacture, packaging, labeling and distribution of dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, and herbs) and cosmetics. The FTC regulates the advertising of these products.
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (“DSHEA”) amended the FDCA to establish a new framework governing the composition, safety, labeling and marketing of dietary supplements. “Dietary supplements” are defined as vitamins, minerals, herbs, other botanicals, amino acids and other dietary substances for human use to supplement the diet, as well as concentrates, metabolites, constituents, extracts or combinations of such dietary ingredients. Generally, under DSHEA, dietary ingredients that were on the market prior to October 15, 1994 may be used in dietary supplements without notifying the FDA. New dietary ingredients (i.e., not marketed in the U.S. prior to October 15, 1994) must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the FDA unless the ingredient has been “present in the food supply as an article used for food” without being “chemically altered.” A new dietary ingredient notification must provide the FDA with evidence of a “history of use or other evidence of safety” establishing that use of the dietary ingredient “will reasonably be expected to be safe.” A new dietary ingredient notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 75 days before the initial marketing of the new dietary ingredient. There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the evidence of safety for any new dietary ingredients that we may want to market, and the FDA’s refusal to accept such evidence could prevent the marketing of such dietary ingredients. In 2011, the FDA issued draft guidance regarding new dietary ingredient notifications, including the scope of the notification requirement and the content of such notifications, and in August 2016, the FDA issued revised draft guidance. While the revised draft guidance is not enforceable, it may be deemed to represent the FDA’s current point of view. Should the FDA enforce the draft guidance as currently written, it would have a negative effect on the innovation and continued marketing of dietary supplements. There is no certainty that the FDA will accept any particular evidence of safety for any new dietary ingredient. The FDA’s refusal to accept such evidence could prevent the marketing of those dietary ingredients.
DSHEA permits “statements of nutritional support” to be included in labeling for dietary supplements without premarket FDA approval. Such statements must be submitted to the FDA within 30 days of first use in marketing and must be accompanied by a label disclosure that “This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.” Such statements may describe how a particular dietary ingredient affects the structure, function or general well-being of the body, or the mechanism of action by which a dietary ingredient may affect body structure, function or well-being, but may not expressly or implicitly represent that a dietary supplement will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent a disease. Any statement of nutritional support we make in labeling must possess scientific evidence substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. If the FDA were to determine that a particular statement of nutritional support was an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a health claim about disease risk reduction for a food product, or if the FDA were to determine that a particular claim was not adequately supported by existing scientific data or was false or misleading, we would be prevented from using that claim. In addition, the 
14


FDA deems internet materials as labeling; therefore, our internet materials must comply with FDA requirements and could be the subject of regulatory action by the FDA, or by the FTC if that agency, reviewing the materials as advertising, considers the materials false and misleading.
DSHEA provides that so-called “third-party literature,” such as a reprint of a peer-reviewed scientific publication linking a particular dietary ingredient with health benefits, may be used “in connection with the sale of a dietary supplement to consumers” without the literature being subject to regulation as labeling. Such literature must not be false or misleading; the literature may not “promote” a particular manufacturer or brand of dietary supplement; and a balanced view of the available scientific information on the subject matter must be presented. If the literature fails to satisfy each of these requirements, we may be prevented from disseminating such literature with our products, and any dissemination could subject our product to regulatory action as an illegal drug.
In June 2007, the FDA published current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations that govern the manufacturing, packing and holding of dietary ingredients and dietary supplements. cGMP regulations require dietary supplements to be prepared, packaged and held in compliance with strict rules, and require quality control provisions similar to those in the cGMP regulations for drugs. The FDA could inspect one of our facilities or those of one of our contract manufacturers and determine that the facility was not in compliance with these regulations, and cause affected products made or held in the facility to be subject to FDA enforcement actions. We believe our manufacturing and distribution facilities and practices comply with these rules. In addition, as is common practice in the industry, we rely on our third-party contract manufacturers to ensure that the products they manufacture and sell to us comply with all applicable regulatory requirements and seek representations and warranties in our agreements with these contract manufacturers confirming such compliance.
The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of the FDCA applicable to foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics, including powers to issue a public warning letter to a company, to publicize information about illegal products, to request a recall of illegal products from the market, and to request the United States Department of Justice to initiate a seizure action, an injunction action, or a criminal prosecution in the U. S. courts.
The FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of foods, dietary supplements and cosmetics. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. As a result of our efforts to comply with applicable statutes and regulations, we have from time to time reformulated, eliminated or relabeled certain of our products and revised certain provisions of our sales and marketing program. The FTC has broad authority to enforce its laws and regulations applicable to foods, dietary supplements and cosmetics, including the ability to institute enforcement actions which often result in consent decrees, injunctions, and the payment of civil penalties by the companies involved. Failure to comply with the FTC’s laws and regulations could impair our ability to market our products.
We are also subject to regulation under various state and local laws that include provisions governing, among other things, the registration, formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of foods, dietary supplements and cosmetics. In addition, in the future, we may become subject to additional laws or regulations administered by the FDA or by other federal, state, local or foreign regulatory authorities, to the repeal of laws or regulations that we consider favorable, such as DSHEA, or to more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations. In the future, we believe the dietary supplement industry will likely face increased scrutiny from federal and state regulatory authorities. It is difficult to predict the effect future laws, regulations, repeals or interpretations will have on our business. However, such changes in the regulatory landscape could require the reformulation of certain products, recalls or discontinuance of certain products, additional administrative requirements, revised or additional labeling, increased scientific substantiation or other new requirements. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance.
