 Agribusiness 
  OverviewOur Agribusiness segment is an integrated, global business involved in the purchase, storage, transport, processing and sale of agricultural commodities and commodity products while managing risk across various product lines. The principal agricultural commodities that we handle in this segment are oilseeds, primarily soybeans, rapeseed, canola and sunflower seed, and grains, primarily wheat and corn. We process oilseeds into vegetable oils and protein meals, principally for the food, animal feed and biodiesel industries, through a global network of facilities. Our footprint is well balanced, with approximately 35% of our processing capacity located in South America, 28% in North America, 23% in Europe and 14% in Asia-Pacific. 
  CustomersWe sell agricultural commodities and processed commodity products to customers throughout the world. The principal purchasers of our oilseeds, grains and oilseed meal are animal feed manufacturers, livestock producers, wheat and corn millers and other oilseed processors. As a result, our agribusiness operations generally benefit from global demand for protein, primarily for poultry and pork products. The principal purchasers of the unrefined vegetable oils produced in this segment are our own Food and Ingredients businesses and third-party edible oil processing companies, which use these oils as raw materials in the production of edible oil products for the food service, food processor and retail markets. In addition, we sell oil products for various non-food uses, including industrial applications and the production of biodiesel. 
  Distribution and LogisticsWe have developed an extensive global logistics network to transport our products, including trucks, railcars, river barges and ocean freight vessels. Typically, we either lease the transportation assets or contract with third parties for these services. To better serve our customer base and develop our global distribution and logistics capabilities, we own or operate either directly or through joint venture arrangements, various port terminal facilities globally, including in Brazil, Argentina, the United States, Canada, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Vietnam and Australia. 
 4

           Financial Services and ActivitiesWe also offer various financial services, principally trade structured finance and financial risk management services for customers and other third parties. Our trade structured finance operations leverage our international trade flows to generate trade finance derived liquidity in emerging markets for customers and other third parties. Our financial risk management services include structuring and marketing over-the-counter ("OTC") risk management products to enable agricultural producers and end users of commodities to manage their commodity price risk exposures. Through our Financial Services Group we also engage in proprietary trading of foreign exchange and other financial instruments. Additionally, in Brazil, we provide financing services to farmers from whom we purchase soybeans and other agricultural commodities. Our farmer financing activities are an integral part of our grain and oilseed origination activities as they help assure the annual supply of raw materials for our Brazilian agribusiness operations. 
  BiodieselWe own and operate biodiesel facilities in Europe and Brazil and have equity method investments in biodiesel producers in Europe and Argentina. This business is complementary to our core Agribusiness operations as in each case we supply some of the raw materials (crude vegetable oil and soybean meal) used in their production processes. 
         Raw MaterialsWe purchase oilseeds and grains either directly from farmers or indirectly through intermediaries. Although the availability and price of agricultural commodities may, in any given year, be affected by unpredictable factors such as weather, government programs and policies and farmer planting and selling decisions, our operations in major crop growing regions globally have enabled us to source adequate raw materials for our operational needs. 
  CompetitionDue to their commodity nature, markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to product substitution. Competition is principally based on price, quality, product and service offerings and geographic location. Major competitors include but are not limited to: The Archer Daniels Midland Co. ("ADM"), Cargill Incorporated ("Cargill"), Louis Dreyfus Group ("Louis Dreyfus"), Glencore International PLC and large regional companies such as Wilmar International Limited and COFCO Agri Limited ("COFCO") largely in Asia-Pacific. 
   Food and Ingredients 
  OverviewOur Food and Ingredients businesses include two reportable business segments: Edible Oil Products and Milling Products. We primarily sell our products to three customer types or market channels: food processors, food service companies and retail outlets. The principal raw materials used in our Food and Ingredients businesses are various crude and further processed vegetable oils in our Edible Oil Products segment, and wheat, corn and rice in our Milling Products segment. These raw materials are agricultural commodities that we either produce or purchase from third parties. We believe that our global integrated business model enables us to realize synergies between our Agribusiness and Food and Ingredients operations through raw material procurement, logistics, risk management and co-location of industrial facilities, enabling us to supply customers with reliable, high quality products on a global basis. Additionally, our Food and Ingredients businesses are focused on capitalizing on growing global consumer food trends, including a desire for less processed, healthier foods, interest in new flavors and increases in snacking and eating outside the home. 



Edible Oil Products 

  ProductsOur edible oil products include packaged and bulk oils, shortenings, margarines, mayonnaise and other products derived from the vegetable oil refining process. We primarily use soybean, sunflower, rapeseed and canola oil that we produce in our Agribusiness segment oilseed processing operations as raw materials in this business. We are a leading seller of packaged vegetable oils worldwide, based on sales. We have edible oil refining and packaging facilities in North America, South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Our edible oil products business is largely business to business ("B2B") focused in North America, in Brazil and Europe it is a mix of B2B and business to consumer ("B2C"), and in Asia-Pacific it is largely a B2C focused business.

As part of our corn portfolio, we also sell whole grain and fiber ingredients. In the United States, we have most recently added ancient grains, such as quinoa and millet to our portfolio. We have also introduced a range of extruded products that include die cut pellets for the snack food industry. Additionally, we offer non-GMO products in the United States, including corn varieties. We mill and sell bulk and packaged rice in the United States and also sell branded rice in Brazil under the Primor brand. 
         In August 2016, we announced the acquisition of a controlling interest in Grupo Minsa, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Minsa"), a leading corn flour producer in North America. As part of the transaction, Bunge will control four mills in Mexico and two in the United States, which produce a broad portfolio of branded corn flours and pre-mixes for tortillas and other products. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2017, subject to certain closing conditions, including the resolution of pending litigation brought by a former shareholder of the parent company of Minsa challenging the proposed acquisition. 
  CustomersThe primary customers for our wheat milling products are food processing, bakery and food service companies. The primary customers for our corn milling products are companies in the food-processing sector, such as cereal, snack, bakery and brewing companies, as well as the U.S. Government for humanitarian assistance programs. Our rice milling business sells to customers in the food service and food processing channels, as well as for export markets. 
         CompetitionCompetition is based on a variety of factors, including price, raw material procurement, brand recognition, product quality, nutritional profile, dietary trends and distribution capabilities.

Our major competitors in our U.S. rice milling business include ADM and Farmers' Rice Cooperative. Our major competitors in Mexico include Grupo Elizondo, Molinera de México and Grupo Trimex. 
   Sugar and Bioenergy 
  OverviewWe are a leading, integrated producer of sugar and ethanol in Brazil, and a leading global trader and merchandiser of sugar. We own and operate eight sugarcane mills in Brazil, the world's largest producer and exporter of sugar. As of December 31, 2016, our mills had a total crushing capacity of approximately 21 million metric tons per year. Sugarcane, which is the raw material that we use to produce sugar and ethanol, is supplied by a combination of our own plantations and third-party farmers. Additionally, through cogeneration facilities at our sugarcane mills, we produce electricity from the burning of sugarcane bagasse (the fibrous portion of the sugarcane that remains after the extraction of sugarcane juice) in boilers, which enables our mills to meet their energy requirements. Any surplus electricity is sold to the local grid or other large third-party users of electricity. Our trading and merchandising operations engage in marketing and selling sugar through regional marketing offices in various locations and managing the sugar price risk for our business.

        Since 2014, after our decision of reducing the capital allocated to this business and focusing our investments primarily on agricultural productivity increase and industrial yields, the business has experienced a significant turnaround. The strengthening of our sugarcane milling operations in Brazil, bringing the operating costs down and efficiencies up resulted in significantly improved results. The early stage of an anticipated cycle of higher sugar prices and changes in the fuel policy for the domestic market should contribute to further improvement of our results. Additionally, as previously announced, we are continuing to explore alternatives to reduce our exposure to the Brazilian sugarcane industry. However, the nature and timing of any potential outcome or transaction is uncertain and cannot be predicted. 
  Raw MaterialsSugarcane is our principal raw material in this segment, and we both produce it and procure it through third-party supply contracts. The annual harvesting cycle in Brazil typically begins in late March/early April and ends in late November/early December. Once planted, sugarcane is harvested for five to seven years on average, but the yield decreases with each harvest over the life cycle of the cane. As a result, after this period, old sugarcane plants are typically removed and the area is replanted. The quality and yield of the harvested cane are also affected by factors such as soil quality, topography, weather and agricultural practices. 
         Our mills are supplied with sugarcane grown on approximately 326,000 hectares of land. This land represents approximately 19,000 hectares of land that we own, 211,000 hectares of land that we manage under agricultural partnership arrangements and 96,000 hectares of land farmed by third-party farmers. In 2016, approximately 67% of our total milled sugarcane came from our owned or managed plantations and 33% was purchased from third-party suppliers. Payments under the agricultural partnership agreements and third-party supply contracts are based on a formula, which factors in the volume of sugarcane per hectare, sucrose content of the sugarcane and market prices for sugarcane, which are set by Consecana, the São Paulo state sugarcane, sugar and ethanol council. 
         Our sugarcane planting and harvesting processes are substantially mechanized. Mechanized harvesting does not require burning of the cane prior to harvesting, significantly reducing the environmental impact when compared to manual harvesting, and resulting in improved soil condition. 
  LogisticsHarvested sugarcane is loaded onto trucks and trailers and transported to our mills. Since the sucrose content of the sugarcane begins to degrade rapidly after harvesting, we seek to minimize the time and distance between the cutting of the cane and its delivery to our mills for processing. 
  ProductsOur mills allow us to produce ethanol, sugar and electricity, as further described below. At mills that produce both sugar and ethanol, we are able to adjust our production mix within certain capacity limits between ethanol and sugar, as well as, for certain mills, between different types of sugar (raw and crystal) and ethanol (hydrous and anhydrous). The ability to adjust our production mix allows us to respond to changes in customer demand and market prices. 
         SugarOur current maximum sugar production capacity is 5,900 metric tons per day, which in a season of 5,000 hours of milling, results in an annual maximum production capacity of approximately 1.2 million metric tons of sugar. We produce two types of sugar: very high polarity ("VHP") raw sugar and white crystal sugar. VHP sugar is similar to the raw sugar traded on major commodities exchanges, including the standard NY11 contract, and is sold almost exclusively for export. Crystal sugar is a non-refined white sugar and is principally sold domestically in Brazil. 
  EthanolOur current maximum ethanol production capacity is 6,200 cubic meters per day, which in a season of 5,000 hours of milling, results in an annual maximum production capacity of over 1.3 million cubic meters of ethanol. We produce and sell two types of ethanol: hydrous and anhydrous. Hydrous ethanol is consumed directly as a transport fuel, while anhydrous ethanol is blended with gasoline in transport fuels. 
 8

    ElectricityWe generate electricity from burning sugarcane bagasse in our mills. As of December 31, 2016, our total installed cogeneration capacity was approximately 322 megawatts, with approximately 131 megawatts available for resale to third parties after supplying our mills' energy requirements, representing approximately 596,000 megawatt hours of electricity available for resale. 
  CustomersThe sugar we produce at our mills is sold in both the Brazilian domestic and export markets. Our domestic customers are primarily in the confectionary and food processing industries. The ethanol we produce is primarily sold to customers for use in the Brazilian domestic market to meet the demand for fuel. We also export ethanol in the international market. Our sugar trading and merchandising operations purchase and sell sugar and ethanol from our own operations as well as third parties to meet international demand. 
         OtherWe have a minority investment in a U.S. corn based ethanol production facility and a 50% interest in a joint venture that produces corn based ethanol in Argentina. We have a 49.9% interest in a joint venture with TerraVia Holdings, Inc. (formerly Solazyme, Inc.) for the development and production of value added oils and feed ingredients, which uses sugar supplied by one of our mills as a raw material. 
  CompetitionWe compete with other sugar and ethanol producers in Brazil and internationally, and in the global market with beet sugar processors, producers of other sweeteners and other biofuels producers. The industry is highly competitive, with raw material procurement, cost structure, selling price and distribution capabilities being important competitive factors. Our major competitors in Brazil include Cosan Limited/Raizen, São Martinho S.A., Biosev (Louis Dreyfus) and ED&F Man. Our major international competitors include British Sugar PLC, Südzucker AG, Cargill, Tereos Group, Sucden Group and COFCO. 
   Fertilizer 
  OverviewThrough our operations in Argentina, we produce, blend and distribute a range of NPK fertilizers, including phosphate-based liquid and solid nitrogen fertilizers. NPK refers to nitrogen (N), phosphate (P) and potassium (K), the main components of chemical fertilizers, used for crop production primarily of soybeans, corn and wheat. Our operations in Argentina are closely linked to our grain origination activities as we supply fertilizer to producers who supply us with grain. We also have a 75% controlling interest in a single super phosphate production ("SSP") plant and a strategically located river port facility in Argentina. In Brazil, we supply fertilizer to farmers as part of our grain origination activities, and operate a fertilizer terminal in the Port of Santos. 
  Products and ServicesWe offer a complete fertilizer portfolio, including SSP, ammonia, urea and ammonium thiosulfate that we produce, as well as monoammonium phosphate ("MAP"), diammonium phosphate, triple supersphosphate, urea, UAN, ammonium sulfate and potassium chloride that we purchase from third parties and resell. We market our products under the Bunge brand, as well as the Solmix brand for liquid fertilizers. 
  Raw MaterialsOur principal raw materials in this segment are concentrated phosphate rock, sulfuric acid, natural gas, ammonium nitrate and sulphur. The prices of fertilizer raw materials are typically based on international prices that reflect global supply and demand factors and global transportation and other logistics costs. Each of these fertilizer raw materials is readily available in the international market from multiple sources. 
  CompetitionCompetition is based on a number of factors, including delivered price, product offering and quality, location, access to raw materials, production efficiency and customer service, including, in some cases, customer financing terms. Our main competitors in our fertilizer operations in Argentina are ASP (Agrium), YPF, Profertil, Nidera, Yara International and Louis Dreyfus.

     Risk Management 
         Risk management is a fundamental aspect of our business. Engaging in the hedging of risk exposures and anticipating market developments are critical to protect and enhance our return on assets. As such, we are active in derivative markets for agricultural commodities, energy, ocean freight, foreign currency and interest rates. We seek to leverage the market insights that we gain through our global operations across our businesses by actively managing our physical and financial positions on a daily basis. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." 
 Insurance 
         In each country where we conduct business, our operations and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty. We insure our businesses and assets in each country in a manner that it deems appropriate for a company of our size and activities, based on an analysis of the relative risks and costs. We believe that our geographic dispersion of assets helps mitigate risk to our business from an adverse event affecting a specific facility; however, if we were to incur a significant loss or liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Operating Segments and Geographic Areas 
         We have included financial information about our reportable segments and our operations by geographic area in Note 26 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
   Research and Development, Innovation, Patents and Licenses 
         Our research and development activities are focused on developing products and improving processes that will drive growth or otherwise add value to our core business operations. In our Food and Ingredients business, we have nine research and development centers globally dedicated to supporting product development and enhancement. Additionally, our global innovation activities involve scouting, developing, buying, selling and/or licensing next generation technologies in food, feed and fuel. 
         Our total research and development expenses were $17 million for the year 2016, $16 million for the year 2015 and $20 million for the year 2014. As of December 31, 2016, our research and development organization consisted of 119 employees worldwide. 
         We own trademarks on the majority of the brands we produce in our Food and Ingredients and Fertilizer businesses. We typically obtain long-term licenses for the remainder. We have patents covering some of our products and manufacturing processes. However, we do not consider any of these patents to be material to our business. We believe we have taken appropriate steps to either own or license all intellectual property rights that are material to carrying out our business. 
   Seasonality 
         In our Agribusiness segment, while there is a degree of seasonality in the growing season and procurement of our principal raw materials, such as oilseeds and grains, we typically do not experience material fluctuations in volume between the first and second half of the year since we are geographically diversified between the northern and southern hemispheres, and we sell and distribute products throughout the year. However, the first fiscal quarter of the year has generally been our weakest in terms of financial results due to the timing of the North and South American oilseed harvests as the North American harvest peaks in the third and fourth fiscal quarters and the South American harvest peaks in the second fiscal quarter, and thus our North and South American grain merchandising and oilseed processing activities are generally at lower levels during the first quarter. 
 10

           In our Food and Ingredients segments, demand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays and other annual events. 
         We experience seasonality in our Sugar and Bioenergy segment as a result of the Brazilian sugarcane growing cycle. In the Center-South of Brazil, the sugarcane harvesting period typically begins in late March/early April and ends in late November/early December. This creates fluctuations in our sugar and ethanol inventories, which usually peak in December to cover sales between crop harvests. These factors result in earnings being weighted towards the second half of the year. This segment is also impacted by the yield development of the sugarcane crops over the course of the crop year with sugar content reaching its highest level in the middle of the crop. As a result of the above factors, there may be significant variations in our results of operations from one quarter to another. 
         In our Fertilizer segment, we are subject to seasonal trends based on the South American agricultural growing cycle as farmers typically purchase the bulk of their fertilizer needs in the second half of the year. 
   Government Regulation 
         We are subject to a variety of laws in each of the countries in which we operate which govern various aspects of our business, including the processing, handling, storage, transport and sale of our products; risk management activities; land-use and ownership of land, including laws regulating the acquisition or leasing of rural properties by certain entities and individuals; and environmental, health and safety matters. To operate our facilities, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, licenses and approvals from governmental agencies and our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by governmental agencies. In addition, we are subject to other laws and government policies affecting the food and agriculture industries, including food and feed safety, nutritional and labeling requirements and food security policies. From time-to-time, agricultural production shortfalls in certain regions and growing demand for agricultural commodities for feed, food and fuel use have caused prices for relevant agricultural commodities to rise. High commodity prices and regional crop shortfalls have led, and in the future may lead, governments to impose price controls, tariffs, export restrictions and other measures designed to assure adequate domestic supplies and/or mitigate price increases in their domestic markets, as well as increase the scrutiny of competitive conditions in their markets. 
         Many countries globally are using and producing biofuels as alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. Biofuels convert crops, such as sugarcane, corn, soybeans, palm, rapeseed or canola and other oilseeds, into ethanol or biodiesel to extend, enhance or substitute for fossil fuels. Production of biofuels has increased significantly in the last decade in response to both periods of high fossil fuel prices and to government incentives for the production of biofuels offered in many countries, including the United States, Brazil, Argentina and many European countries. Furthermore, in several countries, governmental authorities are mandating biofuels use in transport fuel at specified levels. As such, the markets for agricultural commodities used in the production of biofuels have become increasingly affected by the growth of the biofuels industry and related legislation. 
   Environmental Matters and Sustainability 
         We incorporate a commitment to sustainability into many of the areas of our business; from how we plan and develop our strategic goals and operate our facilities, to how we do business with our suppliers and customers and engage with our communities. Our philosophy is to "Act, Conserve and Engage" and our efforts include policies and initiatives to reduce deforestation, conserve resources in our operations and engage across our sector to address the sustainability challenges in the agribusiness and food value chain. 
         We are subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Our operations may emit or release certain 
 11

   substances, which may be regulated or limited by applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we handle and dispose of materials and wastes classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies. Our operations are also subject to laws relating to environmental licensing of facilities, restrictions on land use in certain protected areas, forestry reserve requirements, limitations on the burning of sugarcane and water use. We incur costs to comply with health, safety and environmental regulations applicable to our activities and have made and expect to make substantial capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to continue to ensure our compliance with environmental laws and regulations. However, due to our extensive operations across multiple industries and jurisdictions globally, we are exposed to the risk of claims and liabilities under environmental regulations. Violation of these laws and regulations can result in substantial fines, administrative sanctions, criminal penalties, revocations of operating permits and/or shutdowns of our facilities. 
         Additionally, our business could be affected in the future by regulation or taxation of greenhouse gas emissions or policies related to national emission reduction plans. It is difficult to assess the potential impact of any resulting regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. Potential consequences could include increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and we may be required to make additional investments to modify our facilities, equipment and processes. As a result, the effects of additional climate change regulatory initiatives could have adverse impacts on our business and results of operations.

 BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
   1. NATURE OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Description of BusinessBunge Limited, a Bermuda holding company, together with its consolidated subsidiaries and variable interest entities ("VIEs") in which it is considered the primary beneficiary, through which its businesses are conducted (collectively "Bunge"), is an integrated, global Agribusiness and Food company. Bunge's common shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "BG." Bunge operates in four principal business areas, which include five reportable segments: Agribusiness, Edible Oil Products, Milling Products, Sugar and Bioenergy and Fertilizer. 
  AgribusinessBunge's Agribusiness segment is an integrated business involved in the purchase, storage, transport, processing and sale of agricultural commodities and commodity products. Bunge's agribusiness operations and assets are located in North America, South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific with merchandising and distribution offices throughout the world. 
         Bunge's Agribusiness segment also participates in related financial activities, such as offering trade structured finance, which leverages its international trade flows, providing risk management services to customers by assisting them with managing price exposure to agricultural commodities, proprietary trading of foreign exchange and other financial instruments and developing private investment vehicles to invest in businesses complementary to Bunge's commodities operations. 
  Edible Oil productsBunge's Edible Oil Products segment produces and sells edible oil products, such as packaged and bulk oils, shortenings, margarine, mayonnaise and other products derived from the vegetable oil refining process. Bunge's edible oil products operations are located in North America, South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. 
  Milling productsBunge's Milling Products segment includes wheat, corn and rice milling businesses, which purchase wheat, corn and rice directly from farmers and dealers and process them into milled products for food processors, bakeries, brewers, snack food producers and other customers. Bunge's wheat milling activities are primarily in Mexico and Brazil. Corn and rice milling activities are in the United States and Mexico. 
         Sugar and BioenergyBunge's Sugar and Bioenergy segment includes its global sugar merchandising and distribution activities, sugar and ethanol production in Brazil, and ethanol production investments. This segment is an integrated business involved in the growing and harvesting of sugarcane from land owned or managed through agricultural partnership agreements and additional sourcing of sugarcane from third parties to be processed at its eight mills in Brazil to produce sugar, ethanol and electricity. The Sugar and Bioenergy segment is also a merchandiser and distributor of sugar and ethanol within Brazil and a global merchandiser and distributor of sugar through its global trading offices. In addition, the segment includes investments in corn-based ethanol producers in the United States and Argentina. 
  FertilizerBunge's Fertilizer segment operates primarily as a producer and blender of NPK (nitrogen, phosphate and potassium) fertilizer formulas, including phosphate-based liquid and solid nitrogen fertilizers through its operations in Argentina to farmers and distributors in Argentina. This segment also includes the operations of fertilizer ports in Brazil and Argentina. 
         Basis of PresentationThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").

    BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
   1. NATURE OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
  Discontinued OperationsIn determining whether a disposal group should be presented as discontinued operations, Bunge makes a determination of whether such a group being disposed of comprises a component of the entity, or a group of components of the entity, that represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on the reporting entity's operations and financial results. If these determinations are made affirmatively, the results of operations of the group being disposed of (as well as any gain or loss on the disposal transaction) are aggregated for separate presentation apart from the continuing operations of the Company for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. 
  Principles of ConsolidationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bunge, its subsidiaries and VIEs in which Bunge is considered to be the primary beneficiary, and as a result, include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of all entities over which Bunge exercises control. Equity investments in which Bunge has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not control are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. Investments in which Bunge does not exercise significant influence are accounted for by the cost method of accounting. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Bunge consolidates VIEs in which it is considered to be the primary beneficiary and reconsiders such conclusion at each reporting period. An enterprise is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it has a controlling financial interest under U.S. GAAP, defined as (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's business and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE's operations. Performance of that analysis requires the exercise of judgment. 
         Noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries related to Bunge's ownership interests of less than 100% are reported as noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheets. The noncontrolling ownership interests in Bunge's earnings, net of tax, is reported as net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of income. 
         ReclassificationsCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 
  Use of EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often require management to make substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These judgments and estimations may significantly affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. They may also affect reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
         Translation of Foreign Currency Financial StatementsBunge's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the majority of Bunge's foreign subsidiaries is their local currency and, as such, amounts included in the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and changes in equity are translated using average exchange rates during each period. Assets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates and resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
 F-9

    BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
   1. NATURE OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
  Foreign Currency TransactionsMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gain or loss is included in Bunge's consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gain (loss) unless the remeasurement gain or loss relates to an intercompany transaction that is of a long-term investment nature and for which settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future. Gains or losses arising from translation of such transactions are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in Bunge's consolidated balance sheets. 
  Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents include time deposits and readily marketable securities with original maturity dates of three months or less at the time of acquisition. 
  Trade Accounts Receivable and Secured Advances to SuppliersTrade accounts receivable and secured advances to suppliers are stated at their historical carrying amounts net of write-offs and allowances for uncollectible accounts. Bunge establishes an allowance for uncollectible trade accounts receivable and secured advances to farmers based on historical experience, farming economics and other market conditions as well as specific customer collection issues. Uncollectible accounts are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount below the outstanding historical balance or when Bunge has determined that collection is unlikely. 
         Secured advances to suppliers bear interest at contractual rates which reflect current market interest rates at the time of the transaction. There are no deferred fees or costs associated with these receivables. As a result, there are no imputed interest amounts to be amortized under the interest method. Interest income is calculated based on the terms of the individual agreements and is recognized on an accrual basis. 
         Bunge follows accounting guidance on the disclosure of the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses, which requires information to be disclosed at disaggregated levels, defined as portfolio segments and classes. 
         Under this guidance, a class of receivables is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if Bunge determines it probable that all amounts due under the original terms of the receivable will not be collected. Recognition of interest income is suspended once the farmer defaults on the originally scheduled delivery of agricultural commodities as the collection of future income is determined not to be probable. No additional interest income is accrued from the point of default until ultimate recovery, at which time amounts collected are credited first against the receivable and then to any unrecognized interest income. 
  InventoriesReadily marketable inventories ("RMI") are agricultural commodity inventories, such as soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, corn and wheat that are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics, widely available markets and international pricing mechanisms. All of Bunge's RMI are valued at fair value. These agricultural commodity inventories have quoted market prices in active markets, may be sold without significant further processing and have predictable and insignificant disposal costs. Changes in the fair values of merchandisable agricultural commodities inventories are recognized in earnings as a component of cost of goods sold. 
 F-10

    BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
   1. NATURE OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
         Inventories other than RMI are stated at the lower of cost or market by inventory product class. Cost is determined using primarily the weighted-average cost method. 
         Derivative Instruments and Hedging ActivitiesBunge enters into derivative instruments to manage its exposure to movements associated with agricultural commodity prices, transportation costs, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and energy costs. Bunge's use of these instruments is generally intended to mitigate the exposure to market variables (see Note 14). 
         Generally, derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in other current assets or other current liabilities in Bunge's consolidated balance sheets. Bunge assesses, both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether any derivatives designated as hedges are highly effective in offsetting changes in the hedged items. The effective and ineffective portions of changes in fair values of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, along with the gains or losses on the related hedged items are recorded in earnings in the consolidated statements of income in the same caption as the hedged items. The effective portion of changes in fair values of derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to earnings when the hedged cash flows affect earnings or when the hedge is no longer considered to be effective. The ineffective portion of cash flow hedges is recorded in earnings. In addition, Bunge may designate certain derivative instruments as net investment hedges to hedge the exposure associated with its equity investments in foreign operations. The effective portions of changes in the fair values of net investment hedges, which are evaluated based on forward rates, are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets and the ineffective portions of such derivative instruments are recorded in foreign exchange gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of income. 
  Marketable Securities and Other Short-Term InvestmentsBunge classifies its marketable securities and short-term investments as held-to-maturity and trading. Available-for sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains (losses) included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Held-to-maturity securities and investments represent financial assets in which Bunge has the intent and ability to hold to maturity. Trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term and therefore held for only a short period of time. Bunge values its marketable securities at fair value and monitors its held-to-maturity investments for impairment periodically, and recognizes an impairment charge when the decline in fair value of an investment is judged to be other than temporary. 
  Recoverable TaxesRecoverable taxes include value-added taxes paid upon the acquisition of raw materials and taxable services and other transactional taxes, which can be recovered in cash or as compensation against income taxes or other taxes owed by Bunge, primarily in Brazil and Europe. These recoverable tax payments are included in other current assets or other non-current assets based on their expected realization. In cases where Bunge determines that recovery is doubtful, recoverable taxes are reduced by allowances for the estimated unrecoverable amounts. 
  Property, Plant and Equipment, NetProperty, plant and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and depletion. Major improvements that extend the life, capacity or efficiency or improve the safety of an asset are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Costs related to legal obligations associated with the future retirement of capitalized assets 
 F-11

    BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
   1. NATURE OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
 are capitalized as part of the cost of the related asset. Bunge generally capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred during the application development stage. Interest costs on borrowings during construction/completion periods of major capital projects are also capitalized. 
         Included in property, plant and equipment are biological assets, primarily sugarcane, that are stated at cost less accumulated depletion. Depletion is calculated using the estimated units of production based on the remaining useful life of the growing sugarcane. Depreciation is computed based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. 
         Useful lives for property, plant and equipment are as follows: 

   
 | Years | 
Biological assets | | 5 - 7 
Buildings | | 10 - 50
Machinery and equipment | | 7 - 25 
Furniture, fixtures and other | | 3 - 20 
Computer software | | 3 - 10 


 GoodwillGoodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired in a business acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment or between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. Bunge's annual impairment testing is generally performed during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year. 
         Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which has been determined to be the Company's operating segments or one level below the operating segments in certain instances (see Note 7). 
  Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Finite Lived Intangible AssetsFinite lived intangible assets include primarily trademarks, customer lists and port facility usage rights and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their contractual or legal lives (see Note 8) or their estimated useful lives where such lives are not determined by law or contract. 
         Bunge reviews its property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Bunge bases its evaluation of recoverability on such indicators as the nature, future economic benefits and geographic locations of the assets, historical or future profitability measures and other external market conditions. If these indicators result in the expected non-recoverability of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, Bunge evaluates potential impairment using undiscounted estimated future cash flows. If such undiscounted future cash flows during the asset's remaining useful life are below its carrying value, a loss is recognized for the shortfall, measured by the present value of the estimated future cash flows or by third-party appraisals. Bunge records impairments related to property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets used in the processing of its products in cost of goods sold in its consolidated statements of income. Any impairment of marketing or brand assets is recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income (see Note 9).

    BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
   1. NATURE OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
         Property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets to be sold or otherwise disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. 
  Impairment of Investments in AffiliatesBunge reviews its investments annually or when an event or circumstances indicate that a potential decline in value may be other than temporary. Bunge considers various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time that the fair value of the investment is expected to be below its carrying value, the financial condition, operating performance and near-term prospects of the affiliate and Bunge's intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of the fair value. Impairment charges for investments in affiliates are included within selling, general and administrative expenses (see Note 9 and 10). 
  Share-Based CompensationBunge maintains equity incentive plans for its employees and non-employee directors (see Note 24). Bunge accounts for share-based compensation based on the grant date fair value. Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. 
  Income TaxesIncome tax expenses and benefits are recognized based on the tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which Bunge's subsidiaries operate. Under Bermuda law, Bunge is not required to pay taxes in Bermuda on either income or capital gains. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes currently payable and deferred income taxes arising as a result of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities in Bunge's financial statements and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if current evidence does not suggest that the deferred tax asset will be realized. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax (expense) benefit in the consolidated statements of income (see Note 13). 
         The calculation of tax liabilities involves management's judgments concerning uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in the many jurisdictions in which Bunge operates. Investment tax credits are recorded in income tax expense in the period in which such credits are granted. 
  Revenue RecognitionSales of agricultural commodities, fertilizers and other products are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is determinable, the product has been delivered, title to the product and risk of loss transfer to the customer, which is dependent on the agreed upon sales terms with the customer and when collection of the sale price is reasonably assured. Sales terms provide for passage of title either at the time and point of shipment or at the time and point of delivery of the product being sold. Net sales consist of gross sales less discounts related to promotional programs and sales taxes. Interest income on secured advances to suppliers is included in net sales due to its operational nature (see Note 5). Shipping and handling charges billed to customers are included in net sales and related costs are included in cost of goods sold. 
  Research and DevelopmentResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses were $17 million, $16 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
         New Accounting PronouncementsIn November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-18,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230),

  Restricted Cash (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force). Similar to ASU 2016-15 as described below, this update attempts to reduce diversity in practice and provides guidance on the presentation of restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Bunge is evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
         In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17, Consolidation (Topic 810), Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control, which provides that a single decision maker is not required to consider indirect interests held through related parties that are under common control with the decision maker to be equivalents of direct interests in their entity. The new guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on Bunge's consolidated financial statements. 
         In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which eliminates an exception in the current guidance prohibiting a reporting entity to recognize income taxes consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory, such as transfers of intellectual property and property, plant, and equipment, until the asset has been sold to an outside party. The new guidance does not include new disclosure requirements; however, existing disclosure requirements might be applicable when accounting for the current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity transfer. ASU 2016-16 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Bunge is evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
         In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force). This update attempts to reduce diversity in practice by providing guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for Bunge for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Bunge is evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
         In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses (Topic 326), which introduces a new accounting model, referred to as the current expected credit losses (CECL) model, for estimating credit losses on certain financial instruments and expands the disclosure requirements for estimating such credit losses. Under the new model, an entity is required to estimate the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures). The guidance also amends the current impairment model for debt securities classified as available-for-sale securities. The new guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Bunge is evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
         In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, CompensationStock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This update identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including 
 F-14

   1. NATURE OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
 the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on Bunge's consolidated financial statements. 
         In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Under the new provisions, all lessees will report on the balance sheet a right-of-use asset and a liability for the obligation to make payments with the exception of those leases with a term of 12 months or less. The new provisions will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Bunge is evaluating the expected impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
         In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial InstrumentsOverall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends the guidance relating to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted except for certain provisions. Bunge is evaluating the expected impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
         In May 2014, the FASB amended ASC (Topic 605) Revenue Recognition and created ASC (Topic 606) Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The initial effective date is for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016. However, in August 2015, the FASB issued an amendment effectively deferring the implementation date for all entities by one year but also permitting companies to early adopt the guidance as of the original effective date, but not before January 1, 2017. During 2016, the FASB issued additional implementation guidance and practical expedients in ASU 2016-08 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), ASU 2016-10 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, ASU 2016-12 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, and ASU 2016-20 Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to improve the guidance. The new requirements may be implemented either retrospectively for all prior periods presented (i.e., the full retrospective approach), or retrospectively with a cumulative-effect adjustment at the date of initial application (i.e., the modified retrospective approach). The Company expects to adopt the standard under the modified retrospective approach upon its effective date with a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings. The Company has substantially completed its adoption assessment and does not expect a material measurement impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The adoption of the new guidance will require expanded disclosure which the Company is still evaluating.

   1. NATURE OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
  Recently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 on a prospective or retrospective basis, with earlier application permitted. Bunge early adopted this ASU on a prospective basis effective April 1, 2016 and the adoption did not have a material impact on Bunge's consolidated financial statements. 
         In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, InterestImputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30), Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The amendments in this update require debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, consistent with debt discounts, instead of being presented as an asset. Bunge adopted this ASU upon its effective date of January 1, 2016 and the adoption did not have a material impact on Bunge's consolidated financial statements. 
         In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810), Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. The standard makes targeted amendments to the current consolidation guidance and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from applying the VIE guidance and requires companies to reevaluate all legal entities under revised consolidation guidance. The revised consolidation rules provide guidance for evaluating: i) limited partnerships and similar entities for consolidation, ii) how decision maker or service provider fees affect the consolidation analysis, iii) how interests held by related parties affect the consolidation analysis and iv) the consolidation analysis required for certain investment funds. The standard was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and Bunge adopted ASU 2015-02 upon its effective date of January 1, 2016 using a modified retrospective approach. As a result of the initial application of ASU 2015-02, Bunge deconsolidated a Brazilian grain terminal and the remainder of its previously consolidated private equity and other investment funds. There was no cumulative effect to retained earnings as a result of the deconsolidation of these entities since there was no difference between the net amounts subtracted from Bunge's financial statements and the retained interest in those entities. 
 2. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSTIONS 
 


Acquisitions 

         On October 4, 2016, Bunge acquired a 62.8% equity stake in Walter Rau Neusser Öl und Fett Aktiengesellschaft ("Walter Rau Neusser"), a vegetable oil blends producer for large-scale commercial customers based in Germany. Bunge paid approximately $33 million for its controlling interest in Walter Rau Neusser and has been consolidated in Bunge's financial statements. 
         On August 30, 2016, Bunge announced it had reached an agreement to acquire a controlling interest in Grupo Minsa S.A.B. de C.V. ("Minsa"), a leading corn flour producer in North America. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2017, subject to certain closing conditions, including the resolution of pending litigation brought by a former shareholder of the parent company of Minsa challenging the proposed acquisition. As part of the transaction, Bunge will acquire control of four mills in Mexico and two mills in the United States. The purchase price is expected to be approximately $311 million, subject to working capital and other adjustments.

   2. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSTIONS (Continued) 
         On February 28, 2017, Bunge and Cargill, Inc. closed on the acquisition of two oilseed processing plants and operations in the Netherlands and France pursuant to an agreement on August 5, 2016. Bunge paid a total purchase price of approximately $225 million, plus working capital and other adjustments of approximately $120 million. Results of operations for this acquisition will be included in Bunge's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. 
         In October 2015, Bunge Alimentos S.A., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Bunge, closed on the acquisition of 100% ownership interest in Moinho Pacifico, a Brazilian wheat mill and port terminal in Santos, Brazil. Bunge paid approximately 1,087 million Brazilian reais (approximately $282 million). The final allocation of the purchase price based on the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired resulted in $98 million in property, plant and equipment, $10 million in inventory, $9 million in other net assets and liabilities and $97 million of finite-lived intangible assets. The transaction also resulted in $68 million of goodwill allocated to Bunge's milling operations in Brazil. 
         In October 2015, Bunge acquired Whole Harvest Foods ("WHF") for $27 million, including $25 million in cash and $2 million in a working capital adjustment. The purchase price allocation resulted in $4 million in property, plant and equipment, $2 million in inventory and $15 million of intangible assets. The transaction also resulted in $6 million of goodwill allocated to Bunge's edible oils operations in the United States. WHF refines expeller pressed soybean, canola, and cottonseed oil to produce extended life oil that is chemical solvent, trans fat and cholesterol free. WHF has operations in North Carolina and a packaging/distribution center in Nevada within the United States. 
         In June 2015, Bunge entered into a transaction to acquire the 80% majority interest in a biodiesel entity operating a plant in Spain where Bunge had, prior to this transaction, a 20% interest accounted for under the equity method in its Agribusiness segment. The purchase price of the majority interest was $7 million, net of cash acquired including existing loans and other receivables totaling $3 million owed to Bunge by the entity were extinguished as part of the transaction. The preliminary purchase price of $7 million was allocated primarily to property, plant and equipment and $2 million to goodwill. 
         In April 2015, Bunge and Saudi Agricultural and Livestock Investment Company ("SALIC"), formed a Canadian entity, G3. Bunge had a 51% ownership interest in G3. Bunge accounts for G3 under the equity method of accounting as the ownership interest does not provide Bunge with a controlling financial interest due to certain contractual restrictions. In July 2015, G3 closed on the acquisition of an approximate 61% ownership interest in G3 Canada Limited, formerly the Canadian Wheat Board ("CWB") for $368 million Canadian dollars (approximately $266 million, as of December 31, 2015). The remaining interest was acquired by the CWB Farmers Equity Trust. In order to fund the acquisition amount and future cash flow requirements, Bunge contributed capital to G3 of $130 million and SALIC contributed capital in the amount of $126 million and $115 million in the form of convertible debt. Simultaneously, the CWB acquired certain assets of Bunge's grain business in Canada for $88 million, which includes Bunge's export facility and grain elevators in Quebec for $54 million plus certain working capital of $34 million. The consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes a pre-tax gain of $47 million on the sale of the grain assets in Canada. In February 2016, SALIC completed the conversion of debt to equity under the promissory notes granted in favor of G3, thus reducing Bunge's ownership interest from 51% to 35%. Additionally, Bunge has exercised its right under a put option and sold an additional 10% ownership interest in G3 to SALIC for cash, which further reduced Bunge's ownership interest to 25%.

         In March 2015, Bunge acquired the assets of Heartland Harvest, Inc. ("HHI") for $47 million, including $40 million in cash and cash settlement of an existing third-party loan to HHI of $7 million. The purchase price allocation resulted in $18 million in property, plant and equipment, $2 million in inventory and $18 million of finite-lived intangible assets. The transaction also resulted in $9 million of goodwill allocated to Bunge's milling operations in the United State. HHI produces die cut pellets made of a variety of starches which are then expanded through popping, baking or frying in the production of certain lower fat snacks. HHI consists of one facility in the state of Illinois, United States. 



Dispositions 

         On November 30, 2016, Bunge closed on the disposition of a 50% ownership interest in its Terfron port terminal Terminal Fronteira Norte Logistica S.A. ("TFN") in Brazil to Amaggi Exportaçao E Importaçao Ltda. for a total consideration in cash of approximately $145 million, which resulted in a gain of $90 million. As a result of this transaction Bunge will account for the TFN joint venture as an equity method investment. 
         On November 30, 2016, Bunge and Wilmar International Limited ("Wilmar") completed the formation of a joint venture in Vietnam in which Wilmar will invest into Bunge's crush operations in Vietnam, creating a three-party joint venture with Bunge and Wilmar as equal 45% shareholders and Quang Dung, a leading soybean meal distributor in Vietnam, retaining its existing 10% stake in the operations. Bunge received $33 million cash in consideration for its 45% share of interest in Bunge's crush operations. This transaction resulted in a gain of $30 million. As a result of this transaction Bunge will account for the joint venture as an equity method investment. 
         On February 1, 2016, SALIC Canada Limited ("SALIC Canada") converted two non-interest bearing convertible promissory notes issued to SALIC by G3 of $106 million into 148,323,000 common shares of G3, increasing SALIC Canada's ownership percentage in G3 from 49% to 65% and reducing Bunge Canada's ownership in G3 from 51% to 35%. On the same day, Bunge Canada and SALIC Canada transferred all of their common shares of G3 to G3 Global Holdings Limited Partnership in exchange for additional Class A limited partnership units in G3 Global Holdings Limited Partnership. As a result, as of February 1, 2016, G3 Global Holdings Limited Partnership became the holder of all of the issued and outstanding common shares in G3. On March 30, 2016, Bunge Canada, under the G3 Global Holdings Shareholders Agreement, exercised a contractual put right and sold 10% of its common shares to SALIC Canada in exchange for $37 million of cash so that Bunge Canada now holds 25% ownership of G3 Global Holdings Limited Partnership and SALIC Canada holds 75% ownership. 
   3. TRADE STRUCTURED FINANCE PROGRAM 
  Bunge engages in various trade structured finance activities to leverage the value of its trade flows across its operating regions. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, net return from these activities, were $57 million and $66 million, respectively, and were included as a reduction of cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. These activities include programs under which Bunge generally obtains U.S. dollar-denominated letters of credit ("LCs") (each based on an underlying commodity trade flow) from financial institutions and time deposits denominated in either the local currency of the financial institutions counterparties or in U.S. dollars, as well as foreign exchange forward contracts, all of which are subject to legally enforceable set-off agreements.

   7. GOODWILL 
  Bunge performs its annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year. Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of Bunge's reporting units to which goodwill has been allocated to the carrying values of those reporting units. The fair value of certain reporting units is determined using a combination of two methods: estimates based on market earnings multiples of peer companies identified for the reporting unit (the market approach) and a discounted cash flow model with estimates of future cash flows based on internal forecasts of revenues and expenses (the income approach). The market multiples are generally derived from public information related to comparable companies with operating and investing characteristics similar to those reporting units and from market transactions in the industry. The income approach estimates fair value by discounting a reporting unit's estimated future cash flows using a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions and the risk profile of the respective business unit and includes, among other things, assumptions about variables such as commodity prices, crop and related throughput and production volumes, profitability, future capital expenditures and discount rates, all of which are subject to a high degree of judgment. For other reporting units, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis.

Bunge's Brazilian subsidiary's tax deductible goodwill is in excess of its book goodwill. For financial reporting purposes for goodwill acquired prior to 2009, the tax benefits attributable to the excess tax goodwill are first used to reduce associated goodwill and then other intangible assets to zero, prior to recognizing any income tax benefit in the consolidated statements of income. 
(3)
In 2015, goodwill impairment charge of $13 million represents all of the goodwill of the Brazilian tomato products business, recorded in the fourth quarter upon completion of Bunge's annual impairment analysis. This analysis was performed using discounted cash flow projections (the income approach) to determine the fair value of the business unit. The income approach estimates fair value by discounting the business unit's estimated future cash flows using a discount rate that reflects current market conditions and the risk profile of the business and includes, among other things, making assumptions about variables such as product pricing, future profitability and future capital expenditures that might be used by a market participant. All of these assumptions are subject to a high degree of judgment.

  13. INCOME TAXES 
  Bunge operates globally and is subject to the tax laws and regulations of numerous tax jurisdictions and authorities, as well as tax agreements and treaties among these jurisdictions. Bunge's tax provision is impacted by, among other factors, changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange rates and Bunge's profitability in each taxing jurisdiction. 
         Bunge has elected to use the U.S. federal income tax rate to reconcile the actual provision for income taxes. 
         The components of income from operations before income tax are as follows:

Bunge has changed its presentation of the composition of deferred tax assets and liabilities to a net approach, where a net deferred tax asset or liability is disclosed for each primary component of the deferred tax assets and liabilities. The change in presentation did not impact the consolidated balance sheet presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. 


        Bunge has provided a deferred tax liability totaling $13 million and $11 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively for unremitted earnings that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. As of December 31, 2016, Bunge has determined it has unremitted earnings that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested of approximately $1,120 million and accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been made. If these earnings were distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, Bunge would be subject to income taxes either in the form of withholding taxes or income taxes to the recipient; however, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of taxes that would be payable upon remittance of these earnings. 
         At December 31, 2016, Bunge's net operating loss carryforwards totaled $3,350 million, of which $2,709 million have no expiration, including loss carryforwards of $1,705 million in Brazil. While loss carryforwards in Brazil can be carried forward indefinitely, annual utilization is limited to 30% of taxable income calculated on an entity by entity basis as Brazil tax law does not provide for a consolidated return concept. As a result, realization of these carryforwards may take in excess of five years. 
         The remaining tax loss carryforwards expire at various periods beginning in 2016 through the year 2033.

   13. INCOME TAXES (Continued) 
  Income Tax Valuation AllowancesBunge records valuation allowances when current evidence does not suggest that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends primarily on Bunge's ability to generate sufficient timely future income of the appropriate character in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction. 
         As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, Bunge has recorded valuation allowances of $839 million and $798 million, respectively. The net increase of $41 million results primarily from cumulative translation adjustments for Brazil offset by the release of valuation allowances from sugar mills in Brazil. 
  Unrecognized Tax BenefitsASC Topic 740 requires applying a "more likely than not" threshold to the recognition and de-recognition of tax benefits. Accordingly, Bunge recognizes the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, Bunge had recorded unrecognized tax benefits of $81 million and $63 million in other non-current liabilities and $49 million and $1 million in current liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, Bunge recognized $10 million, $1million and $16 million of interest and penalty charges in income tax (expense) benefit in the consolidated statements of income. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, Bunge had included accrued interest and penalties of $36 million and $26 million within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits follows:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​


        The majority of the additions based on tax positions related to prior years relates to three events recognized during 2016. During the second quarter of 2016, one of Bunge's European subsidiaries amended a tax position for the 2010-2015 tax years as a result of the receipt of a tax ruling, and filed refund claims. However, given the unique factual circumstances and the uncertain state of the applicable tax regulations, Bunge has recorded an unrecognized tax benefit of $240 million as of December 31, 2016. In addition, the Company recorded additional unrecognized tax benefits of $30 million and $26 million for tax positions in Asia in the first and fourth quarters of 2016. 
         Except for a $24 million unrecognized tax benefit for temporary differences, substantially all of the unrecognized tax benefits balance, if recognized, would affect Bunge's effective tax rate. A significant portion of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would result in additional deferred tax assets that would be assessed for recoverability. It is anticipated that approximately $213 million of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would be fully offset by a valuation allowance as it is more likely than not that Bunge would not realize a tax benefit from the deferred tax assets.

    BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
   13. INCOME TAXES (Continued) 
         Bunge believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $50 million of its unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized by the end of 2017 as a result of a lapse of the statute of limitations or settlement with the tax authorities. 
         Bunge, through its subsidiaries, files income tax returns in the United States (federal and various states) and non-United States jurisdictions. The table below reflects the tax years for which Bunge is subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities: 

   
 | Open Tax Years | 
North America | | 2009 - 2016
South America | | 2010 - 2016
Europe | | 2004 - 2016
Asia-Pacific | | 2003 - 2016


        As of December 31, 2016, Bunge's Brazilian subsidiaries have received income tax and penalty assessments through 2012 of approximately 4,453 million Brazilian  reais (approximately $1,366 million), plus applicable interest on the outstanding amount. Bunge has recorded unrecognized tax benefits related to these assessments of 23 million Brazilian reais (approximately $7 million) as of December 31, 2016. 
         In addition, as of December 31, 2016, Bunge's Argentine subsidiary had received income tax assessments relating to 2006 through 2009 of approximately 1,275 million Argentine pesos (approximately $80 million), plus applicable interest on the outstanding amount of approximately 3,327 million Argentine  pesos (approximately $209 million). Bunge anticipates that the tax authorities will examine subsequent fiscal years, although no notice has been rendered to Bunge's Argentine subsidiary. 
         Management, in consultation with external legal advisors, believes that it is more likely than not that Bunge will prevail on the proposed assessments (with exception of unrecognized tax benefit discussed above) in Brazil and Argentina and intends to vigorously defend its position against these assessments. 
         Bunge made cash income tax payments, net of refunds received, of $144 million, $271 million and $303 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 
   14. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  Bunge's various financial instruments include certain components of working capital such as cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable. Additionally, Bunge uses short and long-term debt to fund operating requirements. Cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable and short-term debt are stated at their carrying value, which is a reasonable estimate of fair value. See Note 3 for trade structured finance program, Note 17 for deferred purchase price receivable related to sales of trade receivables, Note 11 for long-term receivables from farmers in Brazil, net and other long-term investments, Note 16 for long-term debt, Note 9 for other non-recurring fair value measurements and Note 18 for employee benefit plans. Bunge's financial instruments also include derivative instruments and marketable securities, which are stated at fair value.

   14. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) 
  Fair value is the expected price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Bunge determines the fair values of its readily marketable inventories, derivatives, and certain other assets based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are inputs based on market data obtained from sources independent of Bunge that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are inputs that are developed based on the best information available in circumstances that reflect Bunge's own assumptions based on market data and on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair value standard describes three levels within its hierarchy that may be used to measure fair value. 
         Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include exchange traded derivative contracts. 
         Level 2: Observable inputs, including Level 1 prices (adjusted), quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are less active than traded exchanges and other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include readily marketable inventories and over-the-counter ("OTC") commodity purchase and sale contracts and other OTC derivatives whose value is determined using pricing models with inputs that are generally based on exchange traded prices, adjusted for location specific inputs that are primarily observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. 
         Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are a significant component of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. In evaluating the significance of fair value inputs, Bunge gives consideration to items that individually or when aggregated with other inputs, generally represent more than 10% of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. For such identified inputs, judgments are required when evaluating both quantitative and qualitative factors in the determination of significance for purposes of fair value level classification and disclosure. Level 3 assets and liabilities include assets and liabilities whose value is determined using proprietary pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques; as well as, assets and liabilities for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. Bunge believes a change in these inputs would not result in a significant change in the fair values. 
         The majority of Bunge's exchange traded agricultural commodity futures are settled daily generally through its clearing subsidiary and, therefore, such futures are not included in the table below. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is a significant component of the fair value measurement. The lowest level of input is considered Level 3.

 DerivativesExchange traded futures and options contracts and exchange cleared contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. Bunge's forward commodity purchase and sale contracts are classified as derivatives along with other OTC derivative instruments relating primarily to freight, energy, foreign exchange and interest rates, and are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 as described below. Bunge estimates fair values based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted as appropriate for differences in local markets. These differences are generally valued using inputs from broker or dealer quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or OTC markets. In such cases, these derivative contracts are classified within Level 2. 
         OTC derivative contracts include swaps, options and structured transactions that are valued at fair value generally determined using quantitative models that require the use of multiple market inputs including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets which are not highly active, other observable inputs relevant to the asset or liability, and market inputs corroborated by correlation or other means. These valuation models include inputs such as interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain OTC derivatives trade in less active markets with less availability of pricing information and certain structured transactions can require internally developed model inputs that might not be observable in or corroborated by the market. When unobservable inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. 
         Exchange traded or cleared derivative contracts are classified in Level 1, thus transfers of assets and liabilities into and/or out of Level 1 occur infrequently. Transfers into Level 1 would generally only be expected to occur when an exchange cleared derivative contract historically valued using a valuation model as the result of a lack of observable inputs becomes sufficiently observable, resulting in the valuation price being essentially the exchange traded price. There were no significant transfers into or out of Level 1 during the periods presented. 
  Readily marketable inventoriesRMI reported at fair value are valued based on commodity futures exchange quotations, broker or dealer quotations, or market transactions in either listed or OTC markets with appropriate adjustments for differences in local markets where Bunge's inventories are located. In such cases, the inventory is classified within Level 2. Certain inventories may utilize

   14. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) 
 significant unobservable data related to local market adjustments to determine fair value. In such cases, the inventory is classified as Level 3. 
         If Bunge used different methods or factors to determine fair values, amounts reported as unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and RMI at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income could differ. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to the reporting date, amounts reported in future periods as unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and RMI at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income could differ. 
  Level 3 MeasurementsTransfers in and/or out of Level 3 represent existing assets or liabilities that were either previously categorized as a higher level for which the inputs to the model became unobservable or assets and liabilities that were previously classified as Level 3 for which the lowest significant input became observable during the period. Bunge's policy regarding the timing of transfers between levels is to record the transfers at the beginning of the reporting period. 
  Level 3 DerivativesLevel 3 derivative instruments utilize both market observable and unobservable inputs within the fair value measurements. These inputs include commodity prices, price volatility, interest rates, volumes and locations. In addition, with the exception of the exchange cleared instruments, Bunge is exposed to loss in the event of the non-performance by counterparties on OTC derivative instruments and forward purchase and sale contracts. Adjustments are made to fair values on occasions when non-performance risk is determined to represent a significant input in Bunge's fair value determination. These adjustments are based on Bunge's estimate of the potential loss in the event of counterparty non-performance. Bunge did not have significant adjustments related to non-performance by counterparties at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
  Level 3 Readily marketable inventories and otherThe significant unobservable inputs resulting in Level 3 classification for RMI, physically settled forward purchase and sale contracts, and trade accounts receivable and payable, net, relate to certain management estimations regarding costs of transportation and other local market or location-related adjustments, primarily freight related adjustments in the interior of Brazil and the lack of market corroborated information in Canada. In both situations, Bunge uses proprietary information such as purchase and sale contracts and contracted prices for freight, premiums and discounts to value its contracts. Movements in the price of these unobservable inputs alone would not have a material effect on Bunge's financial statements as these contracts do not typically exceed one future crop cycle. 
         The tables below present reconciliations for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the years ended December 31,

  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
  Interest rate derivativesBunge from time-to-time uses interest rate derivatives, including interest rate swaps, interest rate basis swaps, interest rate options or interest rate futures. Bunge has entered into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of managing certain of its interest rate exposures. The interest rate swaps used by Bunge as hedging instruments have been recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded contemporaneously in earnings. These swap agreements have been designated as fair value hedges. Additionally, the carrying amount of the associated hedged debt is adjusted through earnings for changes in the fair value arising from changes in benchmark interest rates. Ineffectiveness is recognized to the extent that these two adjustments do not offset. 
         As of December 31, 2016, Bunge had fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements. Below is a summary of Bunge's current interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedge agreements as of December 31, 2016. 

   
Notional Amount of Hedged Obligation | Notional Amount of Derivative | | Maturity Date | | Payment Weighted Average Rate Payable | | Fixed Rate Receivable
$500 | $ | 500 | | November 24, 2020 | | 3 month LIBOR plus 1.91% | | 3.50 | %
euro 800 | euro | 800 | | June 16, 2023 | | 6 month EURIBOR plus 1.64% | | 1.85 | %
$550 | $ | 550 | | August 15, 2026 | | 3 month LIBOR plus 1.12% | | 3.25 | %


        Additionally, on various dates in 2016, Bunge entered into interest rate futures, one year interest rate swap agreements and forward rate agreements that do not qualify for hedge accounting, and therefore Bunge has not designated these as hedge instruments for accounting purposes. The interest

        Foreign exchange derivatives and hedging activitiesBunge uses a combination of foreign exchange forward, swap and option contracts in certain of its operations to mitigate the risk from exchange rate fluctuations in connection with certain commercial and balance sheet exposures. The foreign exchange forward and option contracts may be designated as cash flow hedges. Bunge may also use net investment hedges to partially offset the translation adjustments arising from the remeasurement of its investment in certain of its foreign subsidiaries. 
         Foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency debt. Bunge has 800 million euro senior unsecured euro-denominated notes of which 797 million euro is designated as, and effective as, a net investment hedge of  euro denominated assets. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within OCI. 
         Bunge assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the hedged items.

        Commodity derivativesBunge uses commodity derivative instruments to manage its exposure to movements associated with agricultural commodity prices. Bunge generally uses exchange traded futures and options contracts to minimize the effects of changes in the prices of agricultural commodities on its agricultural commodity inventories and forward purchase and sale contracts, but may also from time-to-time enter into OTC commodity transactions, including swaps, which are settled in cash at maturity or termination based on exchange-quoted futures prices. Forward purchase and sale contracts are primarily settled through delivery of agricultural commodities. While Bunge considers these exchange traded futures and forward purchase and sale contracts to be effective economic hedges, Bunge does not designate or account for the majority of its commodity contracts as hedges. The forward contracts require performance of both Bunge and the contract counterparty in future periods. Contracts to purchase agricultural commodities generally relate to current or future crop years for delivery periods quoted by regulated commodity exchanges. Contracts for the sale of agricultural commodities generally do not extend beyond one future crop cycle. 
         The table below summarizes the volumes of open agricultural commodities derivative positions.

        Bunge's commercial paper program is supported by an identical amount of committed back up bank credit lines (the "Liquidity Facility") provided by banks that are rated at least A-1 by Standard & Poor's Financial Services and P-1 by Moody's Investors Service. On November 20, 2014, Bunge entered into an unsecured $600 million five-year Liquidity Facility with certain lenders party thereto. The Liquidity Facility replaced the then existing $600 million five-year liquidity facility, dated as of November 17, 2011. The cost of borrowing under the Liquidity Facility would typically be higher than the cost of issuing under Bunge's commercial paper program. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and no borrowings under the Liquidity Facility. 
         In addition to the committed facilities discussed above, from time-to-time, Bunge Limited and/or its financing subsidiaries enter into uncommitted bilateral short-term credit lines as necessary based on its financing requirements. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, nil and nil were outstanding under these bilateral short-term credit lines, respectively. Loans under such credit lines are non-callable by the respective lenders. In addition, Bunge's operating companies had $257 million in short-term borrowings outstanding from local bank lines of credit at December 31, 2016 to support working capital requirements.

         On June 24, 2016, Bunge completed the refinancing on a $200 million three-year committed unsecured bilateral revolving credit facility, to mature on June 24, 2019. A further $500 million of unsecured bilateral revolving credit facilities were refinanced on September 23, 2016 to mature on September 23, 2019. Borrowings under these facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin, which will vary from 0.65% to 1.40% per annum based on the credit ratings on its senior long-term unsecured debt. Amounts under the Facilities that remain undrawn are subject to a commitment fee payable at a rate ranging from 0.20% to 0.25%. 
         On June 16, 2016, Bunge completed the sale of 600 million euro (approximately $670 million) aggregate principal amount of 1.85% senior notes due June 16, 2023 ("Notes"). Additionally, on November 17, 2016 Bunge completed the sale of 200 million  euro (approximately $214 million) of the Notes bringing the aggregate principal amount to 800 million  euro. The Notes were issued by Bunge's 100% owned finance subsidiary, Bunge Finance Europe B.V., and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Bunge. The offering was made pursuant to a registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The aggregated net proceeds of 802 million  euro (approximately $887 million) were used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, which includes indebtedness under revolving credit facilities. 
         At December 31, 2016, Bunge had $5,015 million of unused and available borrowing capacity under its committed long-term credit facilities with a number of lending institutions. 
         Certain land, property, equipment and investments in consolidated subsidiaries having a net carrying value of approximately $63 million at December 31, 2016 have been mortgaged or otherwise collateralized against long-term debt of $41 million at December 31, 2016.

        Bunge's credit facilities and certain senior notes require it to comply with specified financial covenants related to minimum net worth, minimum current ratio, a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and limitations on secured indebtedness. Bunge was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2016. 
         During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Bunge paid interest, net of interest capitalized, of $234 million, $227 million and $223 million, respectively.

   17. TRADE RECEIVABLES SECURITIZATION PROGRAM 
  Bunge and certain of its subsidiaries participate in a trade receivables securitization program ("Program") with a financial institution, as administrative agent, and certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the Purchasers) that provides for funding of up to $700 million against receivables sold into the Program. The Program is designed to enhance Bunge's financial flexibility by providing an additional source of liquidity for its operations. In connection with the Program, certain of Bunge's U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries that originate trade receivables may sell eligible receivables in their entirety on a revolving basis to a consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, Bunge Securitization B.V. ("BSBV") formed under the laws of The Netherlands. BSBV in turn sells such purchased trade receivables to the administrative agent (acting on behalf of the Purchasers) pursuant to a receivables transfer agreement. In connection with these sales of accounts receivable, Bunge receives a portion of the proceeds up front and an additional amount upon the collection of the underlying receivables, which is expected to be generally between 10% and 15% of the aggregate amount of receivables sold through the Program. 
         Koninklijke Bunge B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of Bunge, acts as master servicer, responsible for servicing and collecting the accounts receivable for the Program. The Program terminates on May 26, 2021. The trade receivables sold under the program are subject to specified eligibility criteria, including eligible currencies, and country and obligor concentration limits. 
         The table below summarizes the cash flows and discounts of Bunge's trade receivables associated with the Program. Servicing fees under the Program were not significant in any period.

 2016 and 2015 were insignificant. Bunge has reflected all cash flows under the Program as operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. 
 18. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
  Certain U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian based subsidiaries of Bunge sponsor non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees of the subsidiaries. The plans provide benefits based primarily on participants' salary and length of service. The funding policies for Bunge's defined benefit pension plans are determined in accordance with statutory funding requirements. The most significant defined benefit plan is in the United States. The U.S. funding policy requires at least those amounts required by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Assets of the plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income investments. 
         Certain United States and Brazil based subsidiaries of Bunge have benefit plans to provide certain postretirement healthcare benefits to eligible retired employees of those subsidiaries. The plans require minimum retiree contributions and define the maximum amount the subsidiaries will be obligated to pay under the plans. Bunge's policy is to fund these costs as they become payable. 
         Plan Amendments and Transfers In and OutThere were no significant amendments, settlements or transfers into or out of Bunge's employee benefit plans during the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015.

 prior service credit of $6 million ($4 million, net of tax) and unrecognized actuarial loss of $190 million ($124 million, net of tax). Expected prior service costs and unrecognized actuarial losses as a component of net periodic benefit costs included in accumulated other comprehensive income in 2016 is $10 million ($7 million, net of tax). 
         Included in accumulated other comprehensive income for postretirement healthcare benefits at December 31, 2016 are the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic benefit costs: unrecognized prior service credit of $1 million ($1 million, net of tax), and unrecognized actuarial loss of $14 million ($9 million, net of tax). Bunge does not expect to recognize any unrecognized prior service credits or unrecognized actuarial losses as components of net periodic benefit costs for its postretirement benefit plans in 2016. 
         Bunge has aggregated certain defined benefit pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of fair value of plan assets with pension plans that have fair value of plan assets in excess of projected benefit obligations. At December 31, 2016, $941 million projected benefit obligations includes plans with projected benefit obligations of $806 million which were in excess of the fair value of related plan assets of $589 million. At December 31, 2015, the $864 million projected benefit obligations include plans with projected benefit obligations of $758 million which were in excess of the fair value of related plan assets of $570 million. The accumulated benefit obligation for the defined pension benefit plans, respectively, was $850 million at December 31, 2016 and $786 million at December 31, 2015. 
         The following table summarizes information relating to aggregated defined benefit pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets: 

   
 | Pension Benefits December 31, |

Fair value of plan assets | $ | 484 | | $ | 474


        At December 31, 2016, for measurement purposes related to postretirement benefit plans, an 8.8% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits was assumed for 2016, decreasing to 8.0% by 2038, remaining at that level thereafter. At December 31, 2015, for measurement purposes related to postretirement benefit plans, an 8.1% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits was assumed for 2015, decreasing to 7.4% by 2029, remaining at that level thereafter.

        The sponsoring subsidiaries select the expected long-term rate of return on assets in consultation with their investment advisors and actuaries. These rates are intended to reflect the average rates of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide required plan benefits. The plans are assumed to continue in effect as long as assets are expected to be invested. 
         In estimating the expected long-term rate of return on assets, appropriate consideration is given to historical performance for the major asset classes held or anticipated to be held by the applicable plan trusts and to current forecasts of future rates of return for those asset classes. Cash flows and expenses are taken into consideration to the extent that the expected returns would be affected by them. As assets are generally held in qualified trusts, anticipated returns are not reduced for taxes.

  Pension Benefit Plan AssetsThe objectives of the plans' trust funds are to sufficiently diversify plan assets to maintain a reasonable level of risk without imprudently sacrificing returns, with a target asset allocation of approximately 40% fixed income securities and approximately 60% equities. Bunge implements its investment strategy through a combination of indexed mutual funds and a proprietary portfolio of fixed income securities. Bunge's policy is not to invest plan assets in Bunge Limited shares. 
         Plan investments are stated at fair value which is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Plan classifies its investments in Level 1, which refers to securities that are actively traded on a public exchange and valued using quoted prices from active markets for identical assets, Level 2, which refers to securities not traded in an active market but for which observable market inputs are readily available and Level 3, which refers to other assets valued based on significant unobservable inputs. 
         The fair values of Bunge's defined benefit pension plans' assets at the measurement date, by category, are as follows:

   19. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
  Notes receivableBunge holds a note receivable from Navegações Unidas Tapajós S.A., a 50% equity method investment in Brazil, having a carrying value of $20 million at December 31, 2016, which matures in June 2019, with interest based on CDI, the average one-day interbank deposit rate in Brazil. 
         Bunge holds a note receivable from Solazyme Bunge Renewable Oils Cooperatief U.A., a 49.9% equity method investment in Brazil, having a carrying value of $10 million at December 31, 2016, which matures in April 2017, with an interest rate of 11.05%. 
         In addition, Bunge held notes receivables from other related parties totaling $6 million at December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively. 
  Notes payableBunge holds a note payable with its joint venture Bunge SCF Grain LLC with a carrying value of $18 million at December 31, 2016. This note matures on March 31, 2019 with an interest rate based on LIBOR and is included in other long-term liabilities in Bunge's consolidated balance sheet. 
  OtherBunge purchased soybeans and other commodity products and received port services from certain of its unconsolidated ventures, totaling $1,054 million, $757 million and $746 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Bunge also sold soybeans and other commodity products and provided port services to certain of its unconsolidated ventures, totaling $326 million, $351 million and $345 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, Bunge had approximately $33 million and $16 million of receivables from these ventures included in trade accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets as of those dates. In addition, at December 31, 2016 and 2015, Bunge had approximately $46 million and $25 million of payables to these ventures included in trade accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheets as of those dates. 
         In addition, Bunge provided services during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, to its unconsolidated ventures totaling $103 million, $106 million and $111 million, respectively, for services including primarily tolling and administrative support. Bunge believes all of these transaction values are similar to those that would be conducted with third parties. 
   20. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  Bunge is party to a large number of claims and lawsuits, primarily non-income tax and labor claims in Brazil and non-income tax claims in Argentina, arising in the normal course of business. The ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties. Bunge records liabilities related to its general claims and lawsuits when the exposure item becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. Bunge management does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on Bunge's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the remote possibility of an adverse impact on Bunge's position in the period the uncertainties are resolved whereby the settlement of the identified contingencies could exceed the amount of provisions included in the 
 F-56

 consolidated balance sheets. Included in other non-current liabilities at December 31, 2016 and 2015 are the following amounts related to these matters: 

   
(US$ in millions) | | December 31, 2016 | | December 31, 2015 | 
Non-income tax claims | | $ | 170 | | $ | 163 | 
Labor claims | | | 82 | | | 75 | 
Civil and other claims | | | 98 | | | 78 |

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​


 Non-income Tax claimsThese tax claims relate principally to claims against Bunge's Brazilian subsidiaries, primarily value added tax claims (ICMS, IPI, PIS/COFINS). The determination of the manner in which various Brazilian federal, state and municipal taxes apply to the operations of Bunge is subject to varying interpretations arising from the complex nature of Brazilian tax law. In addition to the matter discussed below, Bunge monitors other potential claims in Brazil regarding these value-added taxes. In particular, Bunge monitors the Brazilian federal and state governments' responses to recent Brazilian Supreme Court decisions invalidating on constitutional grounds certain ICMS incentives and benefits granted by various states. While Bunge was not a recipient of any of the incentives and benefits that were the subject of these Supreme Court decisions, it has received other similar tax incentives and benefits, which are being challenged before the Supreme Court. Bunge has not received any tax assessment from the states that granted these incentives or benefits related to their validity and, based on the Company's evaluation of this matter as required by U.S. GAAP, no liability has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements. 
         On February 13, 2015, Brazil's Supreme Federal Court ruled in a leading case that certain state ICMS tax credits for staple foods (including soy oil, margarine, mayonnaise and wheat flours) are unconstitutional. Bunge, like other companies in the Brazilian food industry, is involved in several administrative and judicial disputes with Brazilian states regarding these tax credits. While the leading case does not involve Bunge and each case is unique in facts and circumstances and applicable state law, the ruling has general precedent authority on lower court cases. Based on management's review of the ruling (without considering the future success of any potential clarification or modulation of the ruling) and its general application to Bunge's pending cases, management recorded a liability of 468 million Brazilian reais (approximately $144 million and $120 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively), plus applicable interest. During the fourth quarter of 2016, Bunge settled a portion of its outstanding liabilities in amnesty programs in certain Brazilian states. As of December 31, 2016, the accrued liability was 418 million Brazilian reais (approximately $128 million), plus applicable interest. 
         As of December 31, 2016, the Brazilian state authorities have concluded examinations of the ICMS tax returns from 1990 to the present and have issued approximately 1,300 assessments totaling approximately 797 million Brazilian reais (approximately $245 million as of December 31, 2016), plus applicable interest and penalties on the outstanding amount. As of December 31, 2015, the claims were approximately 740 million Brazilian  reais (approximately $228 million), plus applicable interest and penalties on the outstanding amount. Management intends to continue to vigorously defend against its pending state cases. Management, in consultation with external legal advisors, has established appropriate reserves for potential exposures.

   20. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) 
         As of December 31, 2016 the Brazilian authorities have concluded examinations of the PIS COFINS tax returns and issued assessments relating to years 2004 through the first quarter of 2011. As of December 31, 2016, the cumulative claims for 2004 through 2011 were approximately 510 million Brazilian reais (approximately $156 million), plus applicable interest and penalties on the outstanding amount. As of December 31, 2015, the claims for 2004 through 2010 were approximately 500 million Brazilian  reais (approximately $154 million as of December 31, 2016), plus applicable interest and penalties on the outstanding amount. Management, in consultation with external legal advisors, has established appropriate reserves for potential exposures. 
         Since 2010, the Argentine tax authorities have been conducting a review of income and other taxes paid by exporters and processors of cereals and other agricultural commodities in the country. In that regard, the Company has been subject to a number of assessments, proceedings and claims related to its activities. In 2011, Bunge's subsidiary in Argentina paid $112 million of accrued export tax obligations under protest and preserved its rights with respect to such payment. In 2012, the Argentine tax authorities further assessed interest on these payments, which as of December 31, 2016, totaled approximately $234 million. In 2012, the Argentine government suspended Bunge's Argentine subsidiary from a registry of grain traders. While the suspension has not had a material adverse effect on Bunge's business in Argentina, these actions have resulted in additional administrative requirements and increased logistical costs on domestic grain shipments within Argentina. Bunge is challenging these actions in the Argentine courts. 
         Labor claimsThe labor claims are principally claims against Bunge's Brazilian subsidiaries. The labor claims primarily relate to dismissals, severance, health and safety, salary adjustments and supplementary retirement benefits. 
  Civil and other claimsThe civil and other claims relate to various disputes with third parties, including suppliers and customers. 
         During the first quarter of 2016, Bunge received a notice from the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense initiating an administrative proceeding against its Brazilian subsidiary and two of its employees, certain of its former employees, several other companies in the Brazilian wheat milling industry and others for alleged anticompetitive activities in the north and northeast of Brazil. Bunge is defending against this action; however, the proceedings are at an early stage and Bunge cannot, at this time, reasonably predict the ultimate outcome of the proceedings or sanctions, if any, which may be imposed.

  (1)
Bunge issued guarantees to certain financial institutions related to debt of certain of its unconsolidated joint ventures. The terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related financings which have maturity dates in 2017 through 2022. There are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable Bunge to recover any amounts paid under these guarantees. At December 31, 2016, Bunge recorded no obligation related to these guarantees. 
(2)
Bunge issued guarantees to certain third parties related to performance of its unconsolidated joint ventures. There are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable Bunge to recover any amounts paid under these guarantees. At December 31, 2016, Bunge recorded no obligation related to these guarantees. 
(3)
Bunge issued guarantees to certain financial institutions which are party to certain operating lease arrangements for railcars and barges. These guarantees provide for a minimum residual value to be received by the lessor at conclusion of the lease term. These leases expire at various dates from 2018 through 2021. At December 31, 2016, Bunge's recorded obligation related to these guarantees was $4 million. 


        Bunge Limited has provided a Guaranty to the Director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture as Trustee for Bunge North America, Inc. ("BNA"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, which guarantees all amounts due and owing by BNA, to grain producers and/or depositors in the State of Illinois who have delivered commodities to BNA's Illinois facilities. 
         In addition, Bunge Limited has provided full and unconditional parent level guarantees of the outstanding indebtedness under certain credit facilities entered into and senior notes issued by, its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2016, Bunge's consolidated balance sheet includes debt with a carrying amount of $4,035 million related to these guarantees. This debt includes the senior notes issued by three of Bunge's 100% owned finance subsidiaries, Bunge Limited Finance Corp., Bunge Finance Europe B.V. and Bunge N.A. Finance L.P. There are largely no restrictions on the ability of Bunge Limited Finance Corp., Bunge Finance Europe B.V. and Bunge N.A. Finance L.P. or any other Bunge subsidiary to transfer funds to Bunge Limited. 
         Freight Supply AgreementsIn the ordinary course of business, Bunge enters into time charter agreements for the use of ocean freight vessels and freight service on railroad lines for the purpose of transporting agricultural commodities. In addition, Bunge sells the right to use these ocean freight vessels when excess freight capacity is available. These agreements generally range from two months to approximately seven years, in the case of ocean freight vessels, depending on market conditions, and 
 F-59

 five to nine years in the case of railroad services. Future minimum payment obligations due under these agreements are as follows: 

   
(US$ in millions) | | Ocean Freight Vessels | | Railroad Services | | Minimum Payment Obligations | 
2017 | | $ | 114 | | $ | 43 | | $ | 157 | 
2018 and 2019 | | | 112 | | | 68 | | | 180 | 
2020 and 2021 | | | 91 | | | 68 | | | 159 |

Total | | $ | 370 | | $ | 281 | | $ | 651 | 
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​


        Actual amounts paid under these contracts may differ due to the variable components of these agreements and the amount of income earned on the sales of excess capacity. The agreements for the freight service on railroad lines require a minimum monthly payment regardless of the actual level of freight services used by Bunge. The costs of Bunge's freight supply agreements are typically passed through to the customers as a component of the prices charged for its products. 
         Also in the ordinary course of business, Bunge enters into relet agreements related to ocean freight vessels. Such relet agreements are similar to sub-leases. Bunge received approximately $60 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 and expects to receive payments of approximately $10 million in 2017 under such relet agreements. 
  CommitmentsAt December 31, 2016, Bunge had approximately $16 million of purchase commitments related to its inventories, $109 million of power supply contracts and $72 million of contractual commitments related to construction in progress. 
   21. REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS 
  In July 2012, Bunge and Nutre Farming B.V. entered into a joint venture agreement whereby Bunge acquired a 55% interest in a newly formed oilseed processing venture in its agribusiness segment in Eastern Europe. Bunge consolidates the venture in its consolidated financial statements. In conjunction with the formation of the venture, Bunge entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining 45% interest at either Bunge's or the noncontrolling interest holder's option in the future. The exercise date and price of the option were reasonably determinable. As a result, Bunge had classified the noncontrolling interest as redeemable noncontrolling interest in its consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2012. During the second quarter of 2016, Bunge exercised its call option for the remaining 45% interest in the joint venture for approximately $39 million. The transaction has concluded in September 2016. 
 22. EQUITY 
  Share Repurchase ProgramIn May 2015, Bunge established a new program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of Bunge's issued and outstanding common shares. The program has no expiration date. Bunge did not repurchase any common shares during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016. Bunge repurchased 3,296,230 common shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 under this program for $200 million. Total repurchases under the program from its inception in May 
 F-60

    BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
   22. EQUITY (Continued) 
 2015 through December 31, 2016 were 4,707,440 shares for $300 million. Bunge completed the previous program of $975 million during the first quarter of 2015 with the repurchase of 2,460,600 common shares for $200 million. 
         Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preference SharesBunge has 6,900,000, 4.875% cumulative convertible perpetual preference shares (convertible preference shares), par value $0.01 outstanding at December 31, 2016. Each convertible preference share has an initial liquidation preference of $100 per share plus accumulated unpaid dividends up to a maximum of an additional $25 per share. As a result of adjustments made to the initial conversion price because cash dividends paid on Bunge Limited's common shares exceeded certain specified thresholds, each convertible preference share is convertible at any time at the holder's option into approximately 1.1507 common shares based on a conversion price of $86.9010 per convertible preference share, subject in each case to certain specified anti-dilution adjustments (which represents 7,939,830 Bunge Limited common shares at December 31, 2016). 
         At any time on or after December 1, 2011, if the closing market price of Bunge's common shares equals or exceeds 130% of the conversion price of the convertible preference shares, for 20 trading days within any period of 30 consecutive trading days (including the last trading day of such period), Bunge may elect to cause all outstanding convertible preference shares to be automatically converted into the number of common shares that are issuable at the conversion price. The convertible preference shares are not redeemable by Bunge at any time. 
         The convertible preference shares accrue dividends at an annual rate of 4.875%. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and are payable, quarterly in arrears, on each March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1, commencing on March 1, 2007, when, as and if declared by Bunge's Board of Directors. The dividends may be paid in cash, common shares or a combination thereof. Accumulated but unpaid dividends on the convertible preference shares will not bear interest. In each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Bunge recorded $34 million of dividends on its convertible preference shares.

The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars from local currency at month-end exchange rates, and the resulting foreign exchange translation gains (losses) are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 


  23. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE 
  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to Bunge common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, excluding any dilutive effects of stock options, restricted stock unit awards, convertible preference shares and convertible notes during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per

   23. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (Continued) 
 share, except that the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding is increased to include additional shares from the assumed exercise of stock options, restricted stock unit awards and convertible securities and notes, if dilutive. The number of additional shares is calculated by assuming that outstanding stock options, except those which are not dilutive, were exercised and that the proceeds from such exercises were used to acquire common shares at the average market price during the reporting period. In addition, Bunge accounts for the effects of convertible securities and convertible notes, using the if-converted method. Under this method, the convertible securities and convertible notes are assumed to be converted and the related dividend or interest expense, net of tax, is added back to earnings, if dilutive. 
         The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share:

the
remaining shares of an oilseed processing operation in Central and Eastern Europe. As further discussed in Note 21 Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest, during the second quarter of 2016
Bunge exercised its call option with Prio for their 45% interest in the joint venture for approximately
$39 million. The transaction concluded in September 2016. Accretion for the respective periods includes the effect of losses incurred by the operations for the years ended December 31,
2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

  (2)
The weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted excludes approximately 4 million, 3 million and 2 million stock options and contingently issuable restricted stock units, which were not dilutive and not included in the computation of earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
(3)
Weighted-average common share outstanding-diluted for the year ended December 31, 2014 excludes approximately 8 million weighted-average common shares that are issuable upon conversion of the convertible preference shares that were not dilutive and not included in the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. 


  24. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 
  For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Bunge recognized in additional paid-in capital approximately $44 million, $46 million and $49 million, respectively, of total compensation expense for awards classified as equity awards related to its stock option and restricted stock unit awards in additional paid-in capital. 
         In 2016, Bunge granted equity awards under the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2016 EIP") and 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2009 EIP"), both shareholder approved plans. Under the 2016 EIP and 2009 EIP, the Compensation Committee of Bunge's Board of Directors may grant equity based awards to officers, employees, consultants and independent contractors in the form of stock options, restricted stock units (performance based or time-vested) or other equity based awards. The 2016 EIP replaced the 2009 EIP, under which, beginning May 26, 2016, no further awards may be granted. Shares issued under the Plan may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued Shares, treasury Shares or Shares reacquired by the Company in any manner, or a combination thereof. 
           (i)  Stock Option AwardsOptions to purchase Bunge Limited common shares are granted with an exercise price equal to the grant date fair market value of Bunge common stock, vest over service periods that generally range from one to three years, and expire 10 years from the date of grant. Vesting may be accelerated in certain circumstances as provided in the plans or associated Award Agreements. Grant date fair value is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis for option grants beginning in 2006 and for options granted prior to 2006, compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of each grant. 
          (ii)  Restricted Stock UnitsRestricted stock units ("RSUs") give recipients the right to receive shares of Bunge common stock upon the lapse of related restrictions determined by the Compensation Committee. Restrictions on RSUs may be based on continued service by the recipient through the designated term and/or based on the achievement of certain performance targets. These targets may be financial or market-based, and the number of units actually earned varies based on the level of achievement of predefined goals. Compensation expense in recognized on a straight-line bases over the vesting period for restricted stock units. RSUs vest in various increments and at various dates, generally 
 F-64

    BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
   24. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION (Continued) 
 over periods ranging from one to three years. Vesting may be accelerated under certain circumstances as defined in the plans or associated Award Agreements. RSUs are generally settled in shares of Bunge common stock upon satisfaction of the applicable vesting terms. Where share settlement may be prohibited under local law, RSUs are settled in cash. At the time of settlement, a participant holding a vested restricted stock unit will also be entitled to receive corresponding accrued dividend equivalent share payments. 
         Bunge has also established the Bunge Limited 2007 Non-Employee Directors' Equity Incentive Plan (the "2007 Directors' Plan"), a shareholder approved plan. Under the 2007 Directors' Plan, the Compensation Committee may grant equity based awards to non-employee directors of Bunge Limited. Awards may consist of restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred restricted stock units and non-statutory stock options. The 2007 Directors' Plan replaced the Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan, under which no further awards may be granted. 
           (i)  Stock Option AwardsOptions to purchase Bunge Limited common shares were historically granted with an exercise price equal to the grant date fair market value of Bunge Limited common stock. Options were set to expire ten years after the date of grant and generally vested and became exercisable on the third anniversary of the grant date. Bunge no longer makes grants of options under the 2007 Directors' Plan and there are no longer any options outstanding under the plan. 
          (ii)  Restricted Stock UnitsRestricted stock units granted to non-employee directors generally vest on the first anniversary of the grant date, provided the director continues to serve on the Board until such date, and are settled in Bunge Limited common stock. RSUs granted as part of our Chairman's supplemental annual retainer have historically vested on December 31 of the year of grant. At the time of settlement, a participant holding a vested restricted stock unit or deferred restricted stock unit is also entitled to receive corresponding accrued dividend equivalent share payments. 
         The fair value of each stock option granted under any of Bunge's equity incentive plans is estimated on the grant date using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model. Assumptions for the prior three years are noted in the following table. The expected volatility of Bunge's common shares is a weighted average of historical volatility calculated using the daily closing price of Bunge's shares up to the grant date and implied volatilities on open option contracts on Bunge's stock as of the grant date. Bunge uses historical employee exercise behavior for valuation purposes. The expected option term of granted options represents the period of time that the granted options are expected to be outstanding based on historical experience and giving consideration for the contractual terms, vesting periods and expectations of future employee behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with a term equal to the expected option term of the respective grants and grant dates.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, Bunge issued 235,204 common shares, net of common shares withheld to cover taxes, including related common shares representing accrued dividends, with a weighted-average fair value of $57.91 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2016, 82,520 performance-based restricted stock units vested. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Bunge canceled approximately 135,948 shares related to performance-based restricted stock unit awards that did not vest due to non-achievement of performance targets and performance-based restricted stock unit awards that were withheld to cover payment of employee related taxes.

   24. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION (Continued) 
         The fair value of RSU and performance-based awards is determined based on the market value of the Company's shares on the grant date. The weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $51.42, $81.97 and $79.26, respectively. 
         At December 31, 2016, there was approximately $42 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock units share-based compensation arrangements under the equity incentive plans, which is expected to be recognized over the next two years. The total fair value of restricted stock units vested during the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $18 million. 
         Common Shares Reserved for Share-Based AwardsThe 2007 Directors' Plan, the 2009 EIP and the 2016 EIP provide that 600,000, 10,000,000 and 5,800,000 common shares, respectively, are to be reserved for grants of stock options, restricted stock units and other awards under the plans. At December 31, 2016, 113,732 and 5,766,487 common shares were available for future grants under the 2007 Directors' Plan and the 2016 EIP, respectively.

 several variables including the quantity of sugarcane produced per hectare, the total recoverable sugar ("ATR") per ton of sugarcane produced and the price for each kilogram of ATR as determined by Consecana, the São Paulo state sugarcane, sugar and ethanol council. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Bunge made payments related to these agreements of $154 million, $125 million and $162 million, respectively. Of these amounts $89 million, $75 million and $95 million, respectively, were payments for advances on future production and $65 million, $50 million and $67 million, respectively, were included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
 26. SEGMENT INFORMATION 
  Bunge has five reportable segmentsAgribusiness, Edible Oil Products, Milling Products, Sugar and Bioenergy, and Fertilizerwhich are organized based upon similar economic characteristics and are similar in nature of products and services offered, the nature of production processes and the type and class of customer and distribution methods. The Agribusiness segment is characterized by both inputs and outputs being agricultural commodities and thus high volume and low margin. The Edible Oil Products segment involves the processing, production and marketing of products derived from vegetable oils. The Milling Products segment involves the processing, production and marketing of products derived primarily from wheat and corn. The Sugar and Bioenergy segment involves sugarcane growing and milling in Brazil, sugar merchandising in various countries, as well as sugarcane-based ethanol production and corn-based ethanol investments and related activities. Following the classification of the Brazilian fertilizer distribution and North American fertilizer businesses as discontinued operations, the activities of the Fertilizer segment include its port operations in Brazil and Argentina and its blending and retail operations in Argentina. 
         The "Discontinued Operations & Unallocated" column in the following table contains the reconciliation between the totals for reportable segments and Bunge consolidated totals, which consist primarily of amounts attributable to discontinued operations, corporate items not allocated to the operating segments and inter-segment eliminations. Transfers between the segments are generally

        Total segment earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT") is an operating performance measure used by Bunge's management to evaluate segment operating activities. Bunge's management believes total segment EBIT is a useful measure of operating profitability, since the measure allows for an evaluation of the performance of its segments without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. In addition, EBIT is a financial measure that is widely used by analysts and investors in Bunge's industries. 
         A reconciliation of total segment EBIT to net income attributable to Bunge follows:
