 Significant Business Developments
  
 On December 19, 2016, Autobytel and Car.com, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Autobytel (“Car.com”), entered into an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, by and among Autobytel, Car.com, and Internet Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Internet Brands”), pursuant to which Internet Brands acquired substantially all of the assets of Autobytel’s automotive specialty finance leads group operated under Car.com. The specialty finance leads program was designed to provide consumers who may not be able to secure loans through conventional lending sources the opportunity to obtain vehicle financing and other services from Dealers or financial institutions offering vehicle financing to these consumers. The transaction was completed effective as of December 31, 2016. The transaction consideration consisted of $3.2 million in cash paid at closing of the transaction and $1.6 million to be paid over a five year period pursuant to a Transitional License and Linking Agreement. Revenues from the specialty finance leads group accounted for 4%, 5% and 7% of total revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company recorded a gain on sale of approximately $2.2 million in connection with the transaction in 2016. See Note 10 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

  Industry Background
  
    We believe that consumers engaged in the vehicle purchasing process have adopted the internet, primarily because the internet is one of the best methods to easily find the information necessary to make informed buying decisions. Additionally, the internet is a primary tool for consumers to begin communicating with local Dealers regarding vehicle pricing, availability, options and financing. J.D. Power and Associates reported in 2016 that 79% of automotive consumer buyers surveyed use third party websites for vehicle research. In addition, we believe that many Dealers and all major Manufacturers that market their vehicles in the U.S. use the internet as an efficient way to reach consumers through marketing programs.
  
    According to Automotive News, U.S. light vehicle sales were 17.5 million in 2016, flat from 17.5 million vehicles sold in 2015.  J.D. Power / LMC Automotive are forecasting 2017 U.S. total light vehicle sales and retail light-vehicle sales at 17.6 million and 14.1 million, respectively.  J.D. Power reported continuing trends of elevated inventories and increased incentive levels. We believe an increase in automotive incentives should result in increased use of the internet by consumers engaged in the vehicle purchasing process and increased submission of Leads by consumers in 2017.
  
  Products and Services
  
 Leads are internally-generated from our Company Websites (“Internally-Generated Leads”) or acquired from third parties (“Non-Internally-Generated Leads”) that generate Leads from their websites (“Non-Company Websites”). We sell Internally-Generated Leads and Non-Internally-Generated Leads directly to Dealers and indirectly to Dealers through a wholesale market consisting of Manufacturers and other third parties in the automotive Lead distribution industry.  Our AutoWeb Program links consumers to Dealers and Manufacturer websites when the consumers click on advertisements on Company Websites as well as websites operated by third parties that have contracted with the Company as publishers under the AutoWeb Program. In addition to our Lead and AutoWeb programs, we also offer Dealers and Manufacturers other products and services, including our iControl by Autobytel®, WebLeads+, Email Manager, Payment Pro®, TextShield®, SaleMove and Lead Call products and services, to assist them in capturing online, in-market customers and selling more vehicles by improving conversion of Leads to sale transactions.
 Lead Programs
  
 We provide Dealers and Manufacturers with opportunities to market their vehicles efficiently to potential vehicle buyers.  Dealers participate in our Lead programs, and Manufacturers participate in our Lead programs, our display advertising programs and our direct marketing programs, reaching consumers that are in the market to acquire a vehicle.  For consumers, we provide, at no cost to the consumer, an easy way to obtain valuable information to assist them in their vehicle shopping process. Leads may be submitted by consumers through our Company Websites or through Non-Company Websites. For consumers using our Company Websites, we provide research information, including vehicle specification data, safety data, pricing data, photos, videos, regional rebate and incentive data, and additional tools, such as the compare and configuration tools, to assist them in this process.  We also provide additional content on our Company Websites, including our database of articles, such as consumer and professional reviews, and other analyses.  Additional automotive information is also available on our Company Websites to assist consumers with specific vehicle research, such as the trade-in value of their current vehicle.
  
  New Vehicle Lead Program. Our Lead program for new vehicles allows consumers to submit requests for pricing and availability of specific makes and models.  A new vehicle Lead provides information regarding the make and model of a vehicle, and may also include additional data regarding the consumer’s needs, including any vehicle trade-in, whether the consumer wishes to lease or buy, and other options that are important to the vehicle acquisition decision. A Lead will usually also include the consumer’s name, phone number and email address and may include a postal address.
  
   Our Leads are subject to quality verification that is designed to maintain the high quality of our Leads and increase the Lead buy rates for our Lead customers. Quality verification includes the validation of name, phone number, email address and postal address. Our quality verification also involves proprietary systems as well as arrangements with third party vendors specializing in customer validation. After a Lead has been subjected to quality verification, if we have placement coverage for the Lead within our own Dealer network, we send the Lead to Dealers that sell the type of vehicle requested in the consumer’s geographic area. We also send an email message to the consumer with the Dealer’s name and phone number, and if the Dealer has a dedicated internet manager, the name of that manager. Dealers contact the consumer with a price quote and availability information for the requested vehicle. In addition to sales of Leads directly to Dealers in our network, we also sell Leads wholesale to Manufacturers for delivery to their Dealers and to third parties that have placement coverage for the Lead with their own customers.

   Dealers participate in our retail new vehicle Lead program by entering into contracts directly with us or through major Dealer groups. Generally, our Dealer contracts may be terminated by either party on 30 days’ notice and are non-exclusive. The majority of our retail new vehicle Lead revenues consists of either a monthly subscription or a per-Lead fee paid by Dealers in our network; however, under our pay-per-sale program, we offer a limited number of Dealers in states where we are permitted to charge on a per transaction basis the opportunity to pay a flat per transaction fee for a Lead that results in a vehicle sale. We reserve the right to adjust our fees to retail Dealers upon 30 days’ prior notice at any time during the term of the contract. Manufacturers (directly or through their marketing agencies) and other third parties participate in our wholesale new vehicle Lead programs generally by entering into agreements where either party has the right to terminate upon prior notice, with the length of time for the notice varying by contract. Revenues from retail new vehicle Leads accounted for 22%, 27% and 32% of total revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Revenues from wholesale Leads accounted for 46%, 47% and 44% of total revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
  
 We measure Lead quality by the conversion of Leads to actual vehicle sales, which we refer to as the “buy rate.” Buy rate is the percentage of the consumers submitting Leads that we delivered to our customers represented by the number of these consumers who purchased vehicles within ninety days of the date of the Lead submission.  We rely on detailed feedback from Manufacturers and wholesale customers to confirm the performance of our Leads. Our Manufacturer and wholesale customers each match the Leads we deliver to our customers against vehicle sales to provide us with information about vehicle purchases by the consumers who submitted Leads that we delivered to these customers.  Autobytel also obtain vehicle registration data from a third party provider. This information, together with our internal analysis allows us to estimate the buy rates for the consumers who submitted the Internally-Generated Leads and Non-Internally Generated Leads that we delivered to our customers, and based on these estimates, to estimate an industry average buy rate. Based on the most current information and our internal analysis, we have estimated that, on average, consumers who submit Internally-Generated Leads that we deliver to our customers have an estimated buy rate of approximately 17%.  Buy rates that individual Dealers may achieve can be impacted by factors such as the strength of processes and procedures within the dealership to manage communications and follow up with consumers.
 
 In addition, we report a number of key metrics to our customers, allowing them to gain a better understanding of the revenue opportunities that they may realize by acquiring Leads from us.  We can now optimize the mix of Leads we deliver to our customers based on multiple sources of quality measurements. Also, by reporting the buying behavior of potential consumers, the findings also can help shape improvements to online Lead management, online advertising and dealership sales process training.  By providing actionable data, we are now placing useful information in the hands of our customers.
  
 During 2016, we continued to focus our Dealer acquisition and retention strategies on dealerships to which we could deliver a higher percentage of our Internally-Generated Leads.  We believe this will result in increased vehicle sales for our Dealers and ultimately stronger relationships with us because, based on our evaluation of  the performance data and information discussed above, we believe our Internally-Generated Leads are of  high quality.  
  
  Used Vehicle Lead Program. Our used vehicle Lead program allows consumers to search for used vehicles according to specific search parameters, such as the price, make, model, mileage, year and location of the vehicle. The consumer is able to locate and display the description, price and, if available, digital images of vehicles that satisfy the consumer’s search parameters.  The consumer can then submit a Lead for additional information regarding a specific vehicle that we then deliver to the Dealer offering the vehicle. In addition to sending Leads directly to Dealers through our Lead delivery system, consumers may choose to contact the Dealer using a toll free number posted next to the vehicle search results. We charge each Dealer that participates in the used Vehicle Lead program a monthly subscription or per Lead fee.  Revenues from used vehicle Leads accounted for 10%, 11% and 12% of total revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
  
  Other Dealer Products and Services
  
 In addition to Lead and AutoWeb programs, we also offer products and services that assist Dealers in connecting with in-market consumers and closing vehicle sales.
  
 iControl by Autobytel®  iControl by Autobytel® is our proprietary technology that allows Dealers many options to filter and control the volume and source of their Leads. iControl by Autobytel® can be controlled at the dealership (or by a representative of Autobytel on behalf of the dealership), at the Dealer group level from a web-based, easy-to-use console that makes it quick and simple for dealerships to change their Lead acquisition strategy to adjust for inventory conditions at their stores and broader industry patterns (such as changes in gas prices or changes in consumer demand). From the console, dealerships can easily contract or expand territories and increase, restrict or block specific models and Lead web sources, making it much easier to target inventory challenges and focus marketing resources more efficiently.

 We currently have over one-half of our new vehicle Dealers participating in our iControl by Autobytel® product.
  
 WebLeads+. Designed to work in connection with a Dealer’s participation in our Lead programs, WebLeads+ offers a Dealer multiple coupon options that display relevant marketing messages to consumers visiting the Dealer’s website.  When a Dealer uses WebLeads+, consumers visiting the Dealer’s website are encouraged to take action in two ways.  First, while interacting with the Dealer website, a consumer is presented with a customized special offer formatted for easy Lead submission. If a vehicle quote is requested, the Lead goes directly into the dealership management tool so a salesperson can promptly address the customer’s questions.  Second, if the consumer leaves the Dealer’s website but remains online, the WebLeads+ product keeps the coupon active in a new browser, providing the Dealer a repeat branding opportunity and giving the consumer an easy way to re-engage with the Dealer’s website through submission of a Lead.  The additional Leads generated by the coupons are seamlessly integrated into our Extranet tool.
  
 Email Manager and Lead Call. Email Manager provides, on behalf of the Dealers, timely and relevant follow up emails to consumers who have submitted Leads on scheduled intervals following a consumer’s Lead submission.  After submission of a Lead, Lead Call provides a live phone call to the consumer on behalf of the Dealer and schedules an appointment for the consumer to visit the dealership regarding the specific vehicle the consumer inquired about.
  
 Payment Pro®.  Payment Pro® is a Dealer website conversion tool based on a third party product that offers consumers real-time online monthly payment information based on an instant qualification process.  The payments are based on the consumer’s credit, the actual vehicle being researched and the Dealer finance rates without requiring the consumer to provide personal information, such as date of birth or social security number. The Lead goes directly into the dealership management tool so that a salesperson can promptly address the consumer’s inquiry.
  
 Mobile Products and Services. We provide Dealers and Manufacturers mobile technologies that facilitate communication between Dealers and car buyers on smart phones and tablets at the time, place and in a manner preferred by many consumers.  At the center of this platform is Autobytel’s unique TextShield® product that offers Dealers the ability to connect with consumers using text communication via a secure platform that protects the consumer’s privacy.  In addition, we offer Dealers mobile websites designed to drive consumer engagement with Dealers as well as mobile apps, text message marketing and the ability for consumers to send information to their mobile devices using our “send to phone” product.
  
 SaleMove.   Our arrangement with SaleMove, Inc. (“SaleMove”) allows Autobytel to provide the automotive industry with innovative technology for enhancing communications with consumers.  SaleMove’s technology allows Dealers and Manufacturers to enhance the online shopping experience by interacting with consumers in real time using the method most comfortable to them including live video, audio and text based chat or by phone helping Dealers improve the online car shopping experience for their customers.  Autobytel is providing the tools necessary to capture the opportunities being created as online shopping becomes increasingly popular with in-market car buyers.
  
  Advertising Programs
  
 Our Company Websites attract an audience of prospective automotive buyers that advertisers can target through display advertising. A primary way advertisers use our Company Websites to reach consumers is through vehicle content targeting. This allows automotive marketers to reach consumers while they are researching one of our comprehensive automotive segments such as mini-vans or SUVs and offer Manufacturers sponsorship opportunities to assist in their efforts both in terms of customer retention and conquest strategies. Our Company Websites also offer Manufacturers the opportunity to feature their makes and models within highly contextual content. Through their advertising placements, Manufacturers can direct consumers to their respective websites for further information. We believe this transfer of consumers from our Company Websites to Manufacturer sites is the most significant action measured by Manufacturers in evaluating our performance and value for the Manufacturer’s marketing programs. Through our agreement with Jumpstart Automotive Group (“Jumpstart”), Jumpstart sells our fixed placement advertising across our Company Websites to automotive advertisers. Jumpstart currently reaches approximately 27 million unique visitors per month and works with every major automotive Manufacturer across its portfolio of digital publishers.  We also offer a direct marketing platform that enables Manufacturers to selectively target in-market consumers during the often-extended vehicle shopping process. Designed to keep a specific automotive brand in consideration, our direct marketing programs allow automotive marketers to deliver specific communication through either email or direct mail formats to in-market consumers during their purchase cycle.

  Our AutoWeb product is our pay-per-click advertising marketplace program. The AutoWeb Program utilizes proprietary technology to offer consumers who are shopping targeted offers based on make, model and geographic location. As these consumers are conducting research on one of Autobytel’s consumer facing websites or on the site of one of our network of automotive publishers, they are presented with relevant offers on a timely basis and, upon the consumer clicking on the displayed advertisement, are sent to the appropriate website location of one of our Dealer, Manufacturer or advertising customers. The AutoWeb network of publisher websites reaches and engages with millions of potential car buyers each month, and we believe it provides high intent, quality traffic that Dealers and other customers cannot typically reach through their own marketing efforts. The AutoWeb solution is flexible and in addition to driving traffic to a vehicle detail page, it can also send website traffic to new vehicle sales, service, used vehicles or to any other department where a customer wants to engage with in-market consumers. In addition, we believe that the AutoWeb solution can be used to conquest competitive shoppers who are researching another brand more effectively than can typically be done using other search engines. Advertisers only pay for the clicks they receive, and are able to structure campaigns with flexible budgets and no long-term commitments in order to manage spend versus key performance indicators. Ongoing feedback from our customers is that this traffic provides excellent time-on-site, below-average bounce rates, higher-than-average page views and is a valuable tool to help Dealers sell more vehicles.
  
 Advertising revenues, including direct marketing, accounted for 16%, 8% and 4% of total revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
  
  Strategy
  
 Our goal is to garner a larger share of the billions of dollars spent annually by Dealers and Manufacturers on automotive marketing services.  We plan to achieve this objective through the following principal strategies:
  
  Increasing The Supply of High-Quality Leads. High-quality Leads are those Leads that result in high transaction (i.e., purchase) closing rates for our Dealer customers.  Internally-Generated Leads are generally higher quality than Non-Internally-Generated Leads and increase the overall quality of our Lead portfolio. Non-Internally-Generated Leads are of varying quality depending on the source of these Leads. We plan to increase the supply of high-quality Leads generated to sell to our customers primarily by:
  
   ●
 Increasing traffic acquisition activities for our Company Websites. Traffic to our Company Websites is monetized primarily though the creation of Leads that are delivered to our Dealer and Manufacturer customers to help them market and sell new and used vehicles, and through the sale of advertising space on our Company Websites. We plan to increase the traffic to our Company Websites through effective SEO and SEM traffic acquisition activities and enhancements to our Company Websites.

 
 
o | SEO and SEM traffic acquisition activities. Traffic to our Company Websites is obtained through a variety of sources and methods, including direct navigation to our Company Websites, natural search (search engine optimization or “SEO”, which is the practice of optimizing keywords in website content to drive traffic to a website), paid search (search engine marketing, or “SEM,” which is the practice of bidding on keywords on search engines to drive traffic to a website), direct marketing and partnering with other website publishers that provide links to our websites. Our goal is that over time, paid traffic such as SEM will be balanced by greater visitation from direct navigation and SEO, which we expect to result in increased Lead volumes and gross profit margins. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Continuing to enhance the quality and user experience of our Company Websites. We continuously make enhancements to our Company Websites, including enhancements of the design and functionality of our Company Websites. These enhancements are intended to position our Company Websites as comprehensive best in class destinations for automotive purchase research by consumers. By doing so, we believe we will increase the volume of our Internally-Generated Leads. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
   ●
 Increasing the conversion rate of visitors to Leads on our Company Websites.  Through increased SEO and SEM activities and significant content, tools and user interface enhancements to our websites, we believe we will be able to increase the number of website visits and improve website “engagement,” and thereby increase the conversion of page views into Leads.  We believe that an increased conversion rate of page views into Leads could result in higher revenue per visitor.

 
   ●
  Relationships with Suppliers of High-Quality Non-Internally-Generated Leads. We plan to continue to develop and maintain strong relationships only with suppliers of Non-Internally-Generated Leads that consistently provide high quality Leads.

  Increasing Leads Sales to our Customers. Our principal source of revenue comes from sales of Leads to our retail and wholesale Lead customers. Our goal is to increase sales of Leads to our customers primarily by:
  
    ●
  Increasing Lead Sales to Retail Dealers. Sales of Leads to our Dealer network constitute a significant source of our revenues.  Our goal is to continue to increase the number of Leads sold to our retail Dealer customers by:

   o
 increasing the quality of the Leads sold to our Dealers,

   o
 increasing the number of Dealers in our Dealer network,

   o
 reducing Dealer churn in our Dealer network,

   o
 providing customizable Lead programs to meet our Dealers’ unique marketing requirements,

   o
 providing additional value added marketing services that help Dealers more effectively utilize the internet to market and sell new and used vehicles,

   o
 increasing overall Dealer satisfaction by improving all aspects of our services,

   o
 increasing the size of our retail Dealer footprint,

   o
 focusing on higher revenue Dealers that are more cost-effective to support, and 

   o
 enhancing our internal Lead generation activities by leveraging our expanded retail lead coverage.

 
 
    ●
 Increasing Lead Sales to Wholesale Customers.  We currently have agreements to sell Leads to 31 Manufacturer Lead programs, including all mainstream Manufacturers with the exception of one luxury brand that has yet to launch a Lead program.  Demonstrating how important third-party leads are to Manufacturers, over the past three years several major Manufacturers, including two major Japanese manufacturers, launched corporate Lead programs for the first time.  Others have completely re-launched their programs and some have changed business rules, pricing or coverage in order to be able to purchase more of Autobytel’s high quality, organic Leads.


  Continuing to develop the AutoWeb targeted pay-per-click marketplace for online automotive advertisers and publishers.  Our merger with AutoWeb allowed us to become the first automotive publisher to benefit from AutoWeb’s pay-per-click platform that uses proprietary technology and a unique pay-per-click business model to analyze web traffic and adjust advertiser costs accordingly based on traffic quality.  This traffic network is targeted to attract high-intent, high-volume publishers and is intended to allow them to monetize traffic that has previously been under-monetized.  In-market car shoppers are presented with highly relevant display advertisements and benefit from an online experience that delivers information that consumers use in making their car buying decisions.  Manufacturers benefit from this high-quality traffic from serious in-market car buyers.  Our AutoWeb program enables Manufacturers and Dealers to optimize their advertising by driving traffic to appropriate areas of their Tier 1 (Manufacturer national advertising), Tier 2 (Manufacturer and advertising associations regional advertising) and Tier 3 (Dealer) websites.  
  
 Moving forward we believe that Manufacturers and Dealers will continue to see the measureable attribution from this click traffic and will reallocate marketing spend from traditional channels into this emerging medium. We also plan to grow the size of this addressable marketplace by adding high-quality and high volume automotive publishers to our network, by targeting in market consumers on a variety of social media platforms and by continuing to optimize this advertising platform on our consumer facing websites, whose traffic we believe will continue to scale. In addition, we believe that the flexibility of our solution combined with high quality traffic with automotive purchase intent may allow us to increase the amount charged per click as the network grows and as the level of attribution from this marketplace is understood by advertising partners.
  
  Increasing Display Advertising Revenues.  As traffic to, and time spent on, our Company Websites by consumers increases, we will seek to increase our advertising revenues.  Through our agreement with Jumpstart we benefit from Jumpstart's relationships with every major automotive Manufacturer and/or its advertising agencies by increasing revenue for our traditional display advertising.  It is our belief that if the volume of our traffic continues to increase, advertisers will recognize this increased value by agreeing to purchase additional advertising space available on our Company Websites.  Additionally, we believe that our AutoWeb program provides an opportunity to increase Autobytel advertising revenue through additional monetization opportunities for our existing and growing traffic.
  
  Focusing on Mobile Products.  As consumers increasingly engage with Internet content using mobile devices, Autobytel will continue to focus on advanced mobile technologies that facilitate communication between Dealers and consumers on smart phones and tablets at the time, place, and in a manner preferred by many consumers.   This focus on the mobile platform is a core part of our strategy moving forward regarding lead generation, automotive research, website advertising and traffic generation.
  
 In addition, we will continue to focus on making mobile tools available to Dealer and Manufacturer customers.  Texting is increasingly becoming the communication method of choice for many consumers and Autobytel’s unique TextShield® platform offers Dealers the ability to connect with consumers using text communication via a secure platform that protects the consumer’s privacy.  In addition, this platform offers much of the same oversite and control that is available in traditional email Lead Management Systems and is essentially a Lead Management System for text. We plan to integrate this technology into our consumer facing websites, lead generation and advertising campaigns so that we can continue to facilitate communication between consumers and Dealers utilizing whatever mobile communication platform they choose.

  Continuing to Expand our Products and Services. We gather significant amounts of data on consumer intent as it relates to purchasing vehicles.  We intend to use these data to create products and services, including direct business database offerings, that we believe will ultimately help Manufacturers and Dealers market and sell more new and used vehicles.  Our objective is to generate revenues from this asset in the most effective and efficient ways possible.
  
  Strategic Acquisitions, Investments and Alliances. Our goal is to grow and advance our business. We may do so, in part, through strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. We continue to review strategic opportunities that may provide opportunities for growth. We believe that strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances may allow us to increase market share, benefit from advancements in technology and strengthen our business operations by enhancing our product and service offerings.
  
  Our ability to implement the foregoing strategies and plans is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.  Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will successfully implement our strategies and plans.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
  
  Seasonality
  
 Our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to various factors, including consumer buying trends, changing economic conditions, Manufacturer incentive programs and actual or threatened severe weather events.  Excluding the effect of acquisitions in 2015, Lead volume is typically highest in summer (third quarter) and winter (first quarter) months, followed by spring (second quarter) and fall (fourth quarter) months.
 Intellectual Property
  
 Our intellectual property includes patents and patent applications related to our innovations, products and services; trademarks related to our brands, products and services; copyrights in software and creative content; trade secrets; and other intellectual property rights and licenses of various kinds. We seek to protect our intellectual property assets through patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other laws and through contractual provisions. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and non-disclosure agreements with third parties with whom we conduct business in order to secure our proprietary rights and additionally limit access to, and disclosure of, our proprietary information.  We have registered trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, including Autobytel, Autobytel.com, MyGarage, Your Lifetime Automotive Advisor®, iControl by Autobytel®, TextShield®, Payment Pro®, AutoWeb®, AutoWeb.com® and the global highway logo. We have also been issued patents related to methods and systems for managing a Lead in data center systems and a method and system for managing Leads and routing them to one or more destinations. We cannot provide any assurances that any of our patents will be enforceable by us in litigation.
  
 Additional information regarding certain risks related to our intellectual property is included in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
  
  Competition
  
 In the automotive-related Lead marketing services and advertising marketplace we compete for Dealer and Manufacturer customers.  Competition with respect to our core Lead referral programs continued to be impacted by changing industry conditions in 2016. We continue to compete with several companies that maintain business models similar to ours, some with greater resources. In addition, competition has increased from larger competitors that traditionally have competed only in the used vehicle market.  Dealers continue to invest in their proprietary websites and traffic acquisition activities, and we expect this trend to continue as Dealers strive to own and control more Lead generating assets under their captive brands.  Additionally, all major Manufacturers that market their vehicles in the U.S. have their own websites that market their vehicles direct to consumers and generate Leads for delivery direct to the Manufacturers’ Dealers.
  
 We believe that third party Leads have been the standard in our industry for many years.  However, we continue to observe new and emerging business models, including pay-per-sale and consumer pay models, relating to the generation and delivery of Leads.  From time to time, new products and services are introduced that take the focus away from third party Lead generation, which we believe is a profitable way to sell vehicles to in-market buyers.  Dealers and Manufacturers may decide to pull back on their third party Lead programs to test these new approaches.
  
 In the display advertising marketplace, we compete with major internet portals, transaction based websites, automotive related companies, numerous lifestyle websites and emerging entrants in the relatively new automotive click revenue medium. We also compete with traditional marketing channels such as print, radio and television.
  
 In the pay-per-click advertising marketplace, we compete with established search engine providers as well as with a growing number of digital marketing platforms focused on generating dealership website traffic from inventory listings and social media campaigns. In addition, some industry providers who have historically specialized in inventory aggregation or on providing SEM agency services to Dealers are now expanding into the area of website traffic generation.

  Customers
  
 We have a concentration of credit risk with our automotive industry related accounts receivable balances, particularly with Urban Science Applications (which represents several Manufacturer programs), General Motors and Ford Direct. During 2016, approximately 28% of our total revenues were derived from these three customers, and approximately 36% or $12.6 million of gross accounts receivable related to these three customers at December 31, 2016.  In 2016, Urban Science Applications accounted for 16% and 19% of total revenues and accounts receivable as of December 31, 2016, respectively.
 Operations and Technology
  
 We believe that our future success is significantly dependent upon our ability to continue to deliver high-performance, reliable and comprehensive websites, enhance consumer and Dealer product and service offerings, maintain the highest levels of information privacy and ensure transactional security. Our Company Websites are hosted at secure third-party data center facilities and public cloud providers. These data centers and public cloud systems include redundant power infrastructure, redundant network connectivity, fire detection and suppression systems and security systems to prevent unauthorized access. Our network and computer systems are built on industry standard technology.
  
 System enhancements are primarily intended to accommodate increased traffic across our Company Websites, improve the speed in which Leads and advertisements are processed and introduce new and enhanced products and services. System enhancements entail the implementation of sophisticated new technology and system processes. We plan to continue to make investments in technology as we believe appropriate.
  
  Government Regulation
