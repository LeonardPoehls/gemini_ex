Item 1. Business
 
We are an immuno-oncology company focused on the development and commercialization of individualized immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer based on our proprietary precision immunotherapy technology platform called Arcelis.
 
Our most advanced product candidate is rocapuldencel-T (formerly referred to as AGS-003), which we are developing for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, or mRCC, and other cancers. We are conducting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of rocapuldencel-T plus sunitinib or another therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed mRCC under a special protocol assessment, or SPA, with the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. We refer to this trial as the ADAPT trial. We dosed the first patient in the ADAPT trial in May 2013 and completed enrollment of the trial in July 2015. In February 2017, the independent data monitoring committee, or IDMC, for the ADAPT trial recommended that the trial be discontinued for futility based on its planned interim data analysis. The IDMC concluded that the trial was unlikely to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in overall survival in the combination treatment arm, utilizing the intent-to-treat population, the primary endpoint of the study. In conjunction with our clinical and scientific advisors, we are analyzing the preliminary ADAPT trial data set and plan to discuss the data with the FDA. We have continued to conduct the ADAPT trial while we conduct our ongoing data review and plan to have discussions with the FDA. We expect that we will make a determination as to the next steps for the rocapuldencel-T clinical program based on this review and discussions. We are also currently supporting an investigator-initiated Phase 2 trial in patients with early stage RCC. Depending upon the results of our ongoing analysis of the data from the ADAPT trial and discussions with the FDA, and subject to our obtaining financing,we plan to support an investigator-initiated Phase 2 trial in bladder cancer and a Phase 2 trial of rocapuldencel-T in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor in mRCC.
 
We are developing AGS-004, our second Arcelis-based product candidate, for the treatment of HIV. We have completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials funded by government grants and a Phase 2b trial that was funded in full by the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID. We are currently supporting an ongoing investigator-initiated clinical trial of AGS-004 in adult HIV patients evaluating the use of AGS-004 in combination with a latency reversing drug for HIV eradication, which is being funded by the NIH and NIAID, and plan to support an investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial of AGS-004 evaluating AGS-004 for long-term viral control in pediatric patients provided that results from our ongoing trial in adult HIV patients are favorable.


Our Arcelis Platform
 
Our proprietary Arcelis precision immunotherapy technology platform utilizes biological components from a patient’s own cancer cells or virus to generate individualized immunotherapies. These immunotherapies employ specialized white blood cells called dendritic cells to activate an immune response specific to the patient’s own disease. Arcelis is based on the work of Dr. Ralph Steinman, winner of the 2011 Nobel Prize in medicine for the discovery of the role of dendritic cells in the immune system. We believe that our Arcelis-based immunotherapies may be applicable to a wide range of cancers and infectious diseases and have the following attributes that we consider critical to a successful immunotherapy:

• | target a patient’s disease-specific antigens, including mutated antigens, or neoantigens, to elicit a potent immune response that is specific to the patient’s own disease; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | overcome the immune suppression that exists in cancer and infectious disease patients; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | induce memory T-cells, a specialized type of immune cell that is known to correlate with improved clinical outcomes for cancer and HIV patients; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | have minimal toxicity; and
--+---------------------------


• | can be produced using a centralized manufacturing process.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------



Despite our recent setback, we continue to believe that our immunotherapies combine the advantages of other approaches to immunotherapy, including approaches to facilitate antigen recognition and approaches to overcome immune suppression such as checkpoint inhibition, while addressing limitations that these approaches present.

We hold all commercial rights to rocapuldencel-T and AGS-004 in all geographies other than rights to rocapuldencel-T in Russia and the other states comprising the Commonwealth of Independent States, which we exclusively licensed to Pharmstandard International S.A., or Pharmstandard, rights to rocapuldencel-T for the treatment of mRCC in South Korea, which we exclusively licensed to Green Cross Corp., or Green Cross, and rights to rocapuldencel-T in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau, which we exclusively licensed to Lummy (Hong Kong) Co. Ltd., or Lummy HK. We have granted to MEDcell Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Medinet Co. Ltd., hereinafter referred to together as “Medinet,” an exclusive license to manufacture rocapuldencel-T for the treatment of mRCC in Japan.
 
Rocapuldencel-T
 
We are developing rocapuldencel-T for the treatment of mRCC and other cancers. We are conducting the ADAPT trial of rocapuldencel-T plus sunitinib / targeted therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed mRCC under an SPA with the FDA. We dosed the first patient in the ADAPT trial in May 2013. In July 2015 we completed enrollment in the ADAPT trial, enrolling 462 patients with the goal of generating 290 events for the primary endpoint of overall survival. We enrolled these patients at 107 clinical sites in North America, Europe and Israel. Under the ADAPT trial protocol, these patients were randomized between the rocapuldencel-T plus sunitinib / targeted therapy combination arm and sunitinib / targeted therapy alone control arm on a two-to-one basis. In February 2017, the IDMC for the ADAPT trial recommended that the trial be discontinued for futility based on its planned interim data analysis. The IDMC concluded that the study was unlikely to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in overall survival in the combination treatment arm, utilizing the intent-to-treat population, the primary endpoint of the study. In conjunction with our clinical and scientific advisors, we are analyzing the preliminary ADAPT trial data set and plan to discuss the data with the FDA. We have continued to conduct the ADAPT trial while we conduct our ongoing data review and plan to have discussions with the FDA. We expect that we will make a determination as to the next steps for the rocapuldencel-T clinical program based on this review and discussions.
 
In addition to the ADAPT trial, we are currently supporting an ongoing investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate treatment with rocapuldencel-T in patients with early stage RCC prior to nephrectomy. This trial was opened for enrollment in late 2014 and five patients were enrolled as of March 16, 2017. We expect that a total of 10 patients will be enrolled in this trial. This trial provides the opportunity to observe the impact of rocapuldencel-T on the immune response in both the peripheral blood and in the primary tumor that is removed after rocapuldencel-T treatment, the latter as evidenced by the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in the tumor. Additionally, we have developed a protocol for a Phase 2 clinical trial of rocapuldencel-T in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor for the treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, but have not yet initiated this trial pending analysis of the data from the ADAPT trial and discussions with the FDA and subject to our obtaining financing.
 
Beyond renal cell carcinoma, we plan to support an additional investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial of rocapuldencel-T in muscle invasive bladder cancer depending upon the results of our ongoing analysis of the data from the ADAPT trial and discussions with the FDA and subject to our obtaining financing. The trial would have two phases: a pre-treatment phase and a treatment phase. In the pre-treatment phase, tumor tissue will be obtained via a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, which will then be used to extract RNA for the manufacture of rocapuldencel-T. In the treatment phase, rocapuldencel-T will be given before tumor resection and combined with standard-of-care cytotoxic chemotherapy. Booster doses of rocapuldencel-T will continue after tumor resection. As with the neoadjuvant renal cancer trial, we have the unique opportunity to observe any meaningful impact of rocapuldencel-T on the immune response in the peripheral blood and immune responses infiltrating the primary tumor.

AGS-004
 
We are developing AGS-004 for the treatment of HIV and are focusing this program on the use of AGS-004 in combination with other therapies for the eradication of HIV. We believe that by combining AGS-004 with therapies that are being developed to expose the virus in latently infected cells to the immune system, we can potentially eradicate the virus. The current standard of care, antiretroviral drug therapy, or ART, can reduce levels of HIV in a patient’s blood, increase the patient’s life expectancy and improve the patient’s quality of life. However, ART cannot eliminate the virus, which persists in latently infected cells, remains undetectable by the immune system and can recur. In addition, ART requires daily, life-long treatment and can have significant side effects.
 
We are supporting an investigator-initiated clinical trial of AGS-004 in up to 12 adult HIV patients to evaluate the use of AGS-004 in combination with one of these latency reversing therapies for the eradication of HIV at the University of North Carolina. This trial is being conducted in two stages. Stage 1 of this trial has been completed and was designed to study immune response kinetics to AGS-004 in patients on continuous ART. These data were used to better define the optimal dosing strategy in combination with a latency reversing therapy in the ongoing Stage 2. We expect that some patients in Stage 1 will rollover into Stage 2, which is studying AGS-004 in combination with one of the latency reversing drugs. The patient clinical costs for the first stage of this trial were funded by Collaboratory of AIDS Researchers for Eradication, or CARE. The NIH Division of AIDS has approved $6.6 million in funding for the second stage of this trial.
 
We also plan to explore the use of AGS-004 monotherapy to provide long-term control of HIV viral load in otherwise immunologically healthy patients and eliminate their need for ART. Accordingly, if initial data from Stage 2 of the ongoing adult eradication study are favorable, we expect to support an investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial of AGS-004 monotherapy in pediatric patients infected with HIV who have otherwise healthy immune systems and have been treated with ART since birth or shortly thereafter and, as a result, are lacking the antiviral memory T-cells to combat the virus. The commencement of this trial is subject to supportive data obtained from the adult eradication trial and approval of the protocol by the principal investigator(s), institutional review boards, the IMPAACT Network leadership and the FDA and to the agreement by the NIH to fund the trial costs not related to AGS-004 manufacturing. Assuming the supportive data and the necessary approvals are obtained, we expect to come to a determination as to whether to conduct this trial in 2017.


Strategy
 
Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing individualized immunotherapies for the treatment of a wide range of cancers. Key elements of our strategy are:

• | complete clinical development and seek marketing approval of rocapuldencel-T for the treatment of mRCC, subject to our ongoing analysis of the preliminary ADAPT trial data set and our discussions with the FDA, and our obtaining financing;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expand clinical development of rocapuldencel-T in other cancers, including early stage RCC and advanced solid tumors; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | commercialize rocapuldencel-T in North America independently and with third parties outside North America; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | lease, build out and equip a facility or otherwise arrange for the commercial manufacture of our products based on our Arcelis platform; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continue clinical development of AGS-004 for the treatment of HIV, potentially through government funding or other third party funding, and collaborate with third parties for commercialization on a worldwide basis; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pursue expansion of our broad intellectual property protection for our Arcelis precision immunotherapy technology platform, product candidates and proprietary manufacturing processes through U.S. and international patent filings and maintenance of trade secret confidentiality.

Immunotherapy to Treat Cancer and Infectious Diseases
 
Cancer cells occur frequently in the human body, yet are effectively controlled by T-cells in the immune system, which recognize proteins produced by the cancer cells, known as antigens, as abnormal and kill the associated cancer cells. Two specific types of T- cells are necessary for an effective anti-cancer immune response: CD8+ T-cells, which kill cancer cells, and CD4+ T-cells, which provide a “help” signal that activates and directs the CD8+ T-cell response.
 
Cancer cells utilize several strategies to escape detection by the immune system and T-cells. For example, cancer cells secrete factors that act systemically to prevent T-cells from responding to activation signals, resulting in the inability of T-cells to carry out their role of killing cancer cells. Chronic viral infections such as HIV or hepatitis C present the same challenges to the immune system as cancer because the immune system must overcome this disease-induced immune suppression to recognize and respond to virus-infected cells.

Immunotherapy is intended to stimulate and enhance the body’s natural mechanism for recognizing and killing cancer cells and virus-infected cells. Current immunotherapeutic approaches to treat cancer can generally be separated into two different mechanisms of action: approaches to facilitate antigen recognition and approaches to overcome immune suppression.
 
Approaches to Facilitate Antigen Recognition
 
Cancer immunotherapies that use an antigen-based approach are designed to stimulate an immune response against one or more tumor-associated antigens. In most cases, the tumor-associated antigens that are being targeted are non-mutated, or normal, antigens, which are usually well tolerated by the immune system. In the context of cancer, these normal antigens are either produced at abnormally high levels or predominantly in tumor cells, or both. The goal of antigen-based immunotherapies is to activate the patient’s own immune system to seek out and kill the cancer cells that carry the targeted antigen. Sanpower Group’s Provenge (sipuleucel-T) for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer is the only antigen-based immunotherapy that has been approved by the FDA. Because these immunotherapies are designed to target specific antigens, they are less likely to have toxicity than traditional cancer therapies. However, antigen-based immunotherapies based on shared or commonly overexpressed antigens may have limited efficacy because they are only able to target one or a limited number of antigens, which may or may not be present in the patient’s cancer cells, and do not capture mutated antigens specific to that patient’s tumor that can drive tumor growth.
Approaches to Overcome Immune Suppression
 
Immunotherapies that rely on approaches to overcome immune suppression are designed to overcome immunosuppression in patients by blocking signaling pathways that prevent T-cell activation and function. The class of monoclonal antibody-based immunotherapies known as checkpoint inhibitors are being developed on the basis of this approach. For example, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s first FDA-approved immunotherapy Yervoy (ipilimumab), a treatment for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, is designed to act by blocking the function of a protein expressed in activated T-cells called CTLA4, which acts as a T-cell “off” switch. By blocking the function of CTLA4, the patient’s T-cells can become activated, resulting in an immune response against tumors. Another pathway that immunotherapies are being developed to address is the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. In this pathway, activated T-cells expressing the protein PD-1 are disabled when binding occurs between PD-1 and its ligand, PD-L1, which is expressed on tumor cells. Approved anti-PD-1/PDL-1 pathway checkpoint inhibitors and those being developed are designed to interrupt this pathway by binding to the PD-1 protein or the PD-L1 ligand to prevent them from binding with each other. Two anti-PD-1/PDL-1 pathway checkpoint inhibitors, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s nivolumab (Opdivo) and Merck’s pembrolizumab (Keytruda), are FDA approved for patients with several types of cancers, including, in the case of nivolumab, second line therapy of patients with mRCC. However, not all patients respond to anti-PD-1/PDL-1 checkpoint inhibitors, and, in most cases, patients whose tumors predominantly express PD-L1 are most likely to respond. Immunotherapies that use checkpoint inhibition have demonstrated the ability to effectively overcome immunosuppression and enable T-cells to function against tumor cells and potentially virus-infected cells. However, these therapies are administered systemically to enable T-cells to function and are not designed to target tumor-specific differences, such as the unique mutations of an individual’s tumor. This lack of specificity can negatively impact healthy tissue and cause significant side effects.
Designing Immunotherapies Using Our Arcelis Platform
 
We believe that our proprietary Arcelis precision immunotherapy technology platform enables us to produce individualized immunotherapies that can combine the advantages of these approaches to immunotherapy while addressing the limitations and disadvantages of these approaches. We have designed our Arcelis platform to create product candidates which have attributes that we believe are critical to a successful immunotherapy:

• | Target disease-specific antigens, including mutated antigens. The immunotherapy should target antigens, including unique mutated antigens, associated with the patient’s disease. We believe that immunotherapies that target only non-mutated, or commonly shared, tumor-associated antigens will be limited in terms of efficacy as non-mutated antigens are generally poor at stimulating immune responses. Our Arcelis precision immunotherapy technology platform uses messenger RNA, or mRNA, from the patient’s own cancer or virus to yield an individualized immunotherapy that contains the patient’s disease-specific antigens, including mutated antigens, and is designed to elicit a potent immune response specific to the patient’s own disease. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Overcome disease-induced immune suppression. The immunotherapy must be able to generate an effective immune response in patients whose immune systems are compromised by their disease. Both tumors and HIV are known to impair the functionality of CD4+ T helper cells, which aid their escape from CD8+ T-cell attack. Our Arcelis-based immunotherapies do not require fully functioning CD4+ helper T-cells to mount an immune response with effective anti-tumor or anti- viral activity as we add the protein known as CD40 ligand, or CD40L, to provide the signaling that the CD4+ helper T-cells would otherwise provide. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Induce memory T-cells. The immunotherapy should be able to induce specific T-cells, such as CD8+CD28+ memory T-cells, which are known to correlate with improved clinical outcomes for cancer and HIV patients. These memory T-cells are long lived and necessary for a durable immune response. Our Arcelis process produces dendritic cells that secrete IL-12, which is necessary to induce and expand patient-specific CD8+CD28+ memory T-cells. These memory T-cells are able to seek out and kill cancer or virus-infected cells that express the antigens identical to those displayed on the surface of the dendritic cells. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Have minimal toxicity. The immunotherapy should have minimal toxicity, which would potentially enable it to be combined with other therapies for cancer and infectious diseases. The mechanism of action of Arcelis-based products induces patient- and disease-specific memory T-cells. The antigen source and the dendritic cells that are both used for the therapy are both derived from the individual patient. This target customization and specificity is less likely to impact healthy tissue and cause toxicity. Our Arcelis-based product candidates have been well tolerated in clinical trials in more than 375 patients with no serious adverse events attributed to our immunotherapies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Arcelis precision immunotherapy technology platform is focused on dendritic cells which present antigens to the attention of the human immune system, including, in particular, T-cells, and are critical to the immune system’s recognition of proteins derived from cancer cells or virus-infected cells. Dendritic cells are capable of internalizing cancer or virus protein antigens and displaying fragments of these protein antigens on their surface as small peptides. The dendritic cells then present these peptide antigens to T-cells. This allows the T-cells to bind to these peptide antigens and, in the case of cancer, target and kill cancer cells expressing these antigens and, in the case of infectious disease, target and kill virus-infected cells to control the spread of infectious virus.
 
The following graphic illustrates the processes comprising our Arcelis precision immunotherapy platform:
 

At the clinical site. As shown in the graphic above, the manufacture of our Arcelis-based immunotherapies requires two components derived from the patient:
 

• | A disease sample: In the case of cancer, the sample consists of tumor cells, and in the case of infectious disease, the sample consists of blood containing the virus. The disease sample is generally collected at the time of diagnosis or initial treatment. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7
-


• | Monocytes: Monocytes are a type of white blood cell, which are obtained through a laboratory procedure called leukapheresis that occurs after diagnosis and at least three weeks prior to initiating treatment with our immunotherapy. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
At the manufacturing facility. The tumor cells or the blood sample and the leukapheresis product are shipped to the manufacturing facility following collection at the clinical site. After receipt of these components at the facility, we take the following steps:
 

• | We isolate the patient’s disease mRNA, which carries the genetic information to recreate the patient’s disease antigens, from the disease sample and amplify the mRNA so that only a small disease sample is required to manufacture the immunotherapy. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Separately, we extract the monocytes from the leukapheresis product and culture them using a proprietary process to produce matured dendritic cells. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We then combine the matured dendritic cells with a solution of the patient’s isolated mRNA and a proprietary synthetic CD40L RNA. We apply a brief electric pulse to the solution in a process referred to as electroporation, which enables the patient’s mRNA and the CD40L RNA to pass into, or load, the dendritic cells. The dendritic cells process the CD40L RNA into CD40L protein, enabling the dendritic cells to secrete IL-12, a cytokine required to induce and expand CD8+CD28+ memory T-cells. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We then further culture the mRNA-loaded dendritic cells so that these cells allow for antigen expression from the patient’s mRNA and presentation in the form of peptides on the surface of the dendritic cells. These mature, loaded dendritic cells are formulated using the patient’s plasma that was collected during the leukapheresis to become the Arcelis-based product. Typically, several years of doses are produced for each patient. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | After verifying the quality of the product, we vial, cryogenically freeze and then ship individual patient doses to the clinic, where each is thawed and administered by intradermal injection. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Patient treatment. Upon injection into the skin of the patient, the mature, loaded dendritic cells are intended to migrate to the lymph nodes near the site of the injection. It is at these lymph nodes that the dendritic cells come into contact with T-cells. This interaction with the loaded dendritic cells is intended to cause a measurable increase in patient- and disease-specific memory T-cells.
 
We believe that our Arcelis precision immunotherapy technology platform allows us to create individualized immunotherapies that may be capable of treating a wide range of cancers and infectious diseases using a centralized manufacturing process. Specifically, our Arcelis platform typically allows us to:



• | produce several years of customized therapy on average for a patient from a small disease sample and a single leukapheresis from that patient; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | produce additional years of therapy for a patient at a later date with an additional leukapheresis enabling the collection of additional monocytes, but without requiring an additional disease sample from the patient;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | use a single manufacturing facility for North America, which is possible because our Arcelis process can utilize monocytes obtained through leukapheresis within four days of the procedure, and doses of our immunotherapies can be shipped frozen in a cryoshipper that can maintain the target temperature for at least ten days; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cryopreserve the multiple doses generated from the single manufacturing process for each patient in a direct injectable formulation that allows the doses to remain stable and usable for up to five years; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | produce immunotherapies that can be administered by intradermal injection in an outpatient procedure. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Rocapuldencel-T for the Treatment of Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma and Other Cancers
 
We are developing rocapuldencel-T for use in combination with sunitinib and other therapies for the treatment of mRCC. Sunitinib is an oral small molecule drug sold under the trade name Sutent and is the current standard of care for initial treatment, or first-line treatment, of mRCC following diagnosis. In April 2012, the FDA notified us that we have obtained fast track designation for rocapuldencel-T for the treatment of mRCC.
 
We are conducting the ADAPT trial of rocapuldencel-T plus sunitinib / targeted therapy compared to sunitinib / targeted therapy monotherapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed mRCC under an SPA with the FDA. In July 2015 we completed enrollment in the ADAPT trial, enrolling 462 patients with the goal of generating 290 events for the primary endpoint of overall survival. In February 2017, the IDMC for the ADAPT trial recommended that the trial be discontinued for futility based on its planned interim data analysis. The IDMC concluded that the study was unlikely to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in overall survival in the combination treatment arm, utilizing the intent-to-treat population, the primary endpoint of the study. In conjunction with our clinical and scientific advisors, we are analyzing the preliminary ADAPT trial data set and plan to discuss the data with the FDA. We have continued to conduct the ADAPT trial while we conduct our ongoing data review and have discussions with FDA. We expect that we will make a determination as to the next steps for the rocapuldencel-T clinical program based on this review and discussions.

We are supporting investigator initiated Phase 2 clinical trials designed to evaluate treatment with rocapuldencel-T in patients with early stage RCC prior to nephrectomy and plan to support investigator initiated Phase 2 clinical trials of rocapuldencel-T in mRCC and muscle invasive bladder cancer, depending upon the results of our ongoing analysis of the data from the ADAPT trial and discussions with the FDA, and subject to our obtaining financing.


Renal Cell Carcinoma
 
RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer. The American Cancer Society, or ACS estimates that there were approximately 63,000 new cases of kidney cancer and approximately 14,000 deaths from this disease in the United States in 2016. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN estimates that 90% of kidney cancer cases are RCC. For patients with RCC that had metastasized by the time RCC was first diagnosed, a condition referred to as newly diagnosed mRCC, the five-year survival rate has historically been approximately 12%.
 
ACS statistics indicate that approximately 25% of newly diagnosed RCC patients present with mRCC in the United States. Additional patients who were initially diagnosed with earlier stage RCC may also progress to mRCC as these patients suffer relapses. The NCCN estimates between 20% to 30% of patients with early stage RCC will relapse within three years of surgical excision of the primary tumor. Although the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, does not provide prevalence of RCC by stage, based on the NCCN’s three-year relapse rate, we estimate that there may be up to an additional 10,000 to 15,000 cases of mRCC identified annually in the United States. Combining newly diagnosed mRCC patients with patients who relapse, we estimate that there may be between 20,000 to 25,000 new cases of mRCC in the United States each year. We estimate, based on publicly available information, including 2013 quarterly and annual reports of companies that market other therapies approved for mRCC, that the current worldwide mRCC market for these other therapies exceeds $2 billion.
 
Physicians generally diagnose mRCC by examining a tumor biopsy under a microscope. Upon evaluation of the visual appearance of the tumor cells, a pathologist will classify the mRCC into clear cell or non-clear cell types. According to the NCCN, approximately 80% of all RCC diagnoses are clear cell RCC. Because clear cell types are the most common type of tumor cell, most of the more recently approved therapies for mRCC have limited their clinical trials to patients with the clear cell type of tumor cell. However, the FDA has not limited the approval of these therapies to clear cell types of mRCC, so they may be used for both clear cell and non-clear cell types.
 
mRCC Patient Classification
 
Upon diagnosis, the prognosis for patients with mRCC is classified into three overall disease risk profiles — favorable, intermediate and poor — using objective prognostic risk factors. These risk factors were originally developed by researchers at Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Center and subsequently revised by Dr. Daniel Heng from the University of Calgary’s Baker Cancer Center and contributors from the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium, or the Consortium, based on clinical data from patients treated with sunitinib and other therapies. These risk factors, which we refer to as the Heng risk factors, have been correlated to adverse overall survival in mRCC and include:

• | time from diagnosis to the initiation of systemic therapeutic treatment of less than one year, which is indicative of more aggressive disease. We refer to this risk factor as the less than one year to treatment risk factor; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | low levels of hemoglobin, a protein in the blood that carries oxygen;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | elevated corrected calcium levels;
--+-----------------------------------


• | diminished overall patient performance status or physical functioning;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | elevated levels of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | elevated platelet count.
--+-------------------------

 
Patients exhibiting zero risk factors at the time of treatment are included in the favorable risk group; patients exhibiting one or two risk factors are included in the intermediate risk group; and patients exhibiting three or more risk factors are included in the poor risk group. Even when treated with standard of care therapies such as sunitinib, patients in the intermediate risk group have an expected survival of less than two years, and patients in the poor risk group have an expected survival of less than one year. In January 2013, Dr. Heng published in Lancet Oncology the following data from the Consortium database regarding overall survival of mRCC patients in these three risk groups treated with sunitinib and other therapies:
 

• | in 157 favorable risk patients, the median overall survival was 43.2 months; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | in 440 intermediate risk patients, the median overall survival was 22.5 months; and

Current Treatment
 
The initial treatment for most mRCC patients when the primary tumor is intact is surgical removal of the tumor, usually requiring partial or complete removal of the affected kidney, referred to as nephrectomy. The NCCN generally recommends systemic treatment with approved therapies for mRCC patients following nephrectomy for patients whose tumors have metastasized or for patients who present with mRCC upon diagnosis or as a result of a relapse from an earlier stage of RCC.
 
Historically, mRCC has been treated with non-specific, cytokine-based immunotherapies such as interferon a and IL-2, which have demonstrated a clinical benefit in a small percentage of mRCC patients. However, these therapies lack specificity and have been demonstrated to have severe toxicities, which can lead to cardiopulmonary, neuropsychiatric, dermatologic, renal, hepatic and hematologic side effects and limits their use. For example, although high-dose IL-2 is the only therapy to have demonstrated durable complete mRCC remissions, its toxicity restricts its use to a small minority of patients and for a short duration.
 
Several targeted therapies, such as Sutent (sunitinib), Votrient (pazopanib), Torisel (temsirolimus), Nexavar (sorafenib), Avastin (bevacizumab) plus interferon- a, Afinitor (everolimus), Inlyta (axitinib), Opdivo (nivolumab) and Cabometyx (cabozantinib) are approved for the treatment of mRCC. While most of these targeted therapies have been evaluated in first-line treatment of mRCC, Sutent demonstrated a higher rate of progression free survival and overall survival in its pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial than that shown by the other targeted therapies in their pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials. According to an independent market research survey conducted during the second half of 2014 of 87 US-based medical oncologists and new prescription data (IMS), Sutent was the first-line drug of choice for approximately half of newly treated advanced RCC patients. In addition, the data showed that the use of Votrient was increasing as initial therapy for advanced RCC.
 
Although most of these targeted therapies have demonstrated prolonged progression free survival as compared to interferon- a, they are rarely associated with durable remissions or enhanced long-term survival, particularly in patients who are classified as intermediate or poor risk at the time of treatment. In addition, each of these targeted therapies has shortcomings that limit their use in the treatment of mRCC, including significant toxicities, such as neutropenia and other hematologic toxicities, fatigue, diarrhea, hand-foot syndrome, hypertension and other cardiovascular effects. The overlapping and combined toxicities of the targeted therapies have prevented their use in combination therapies. For instance, researchers conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial of the combination of sunitinib and temsirolimus discontinued the trial due to toxicities. We believe that the inability to date to combine these therapies without additive toxicity and the absence of durable remissions and prolonged survival in patients with intermediate and poor risk disease indicates there is an unmet need for novel therapeutic approaches for mRCC that can improve efficacy without adding any appreciable toxicity. We determined to conduct the ADAPT trial based on our earlier belief that the combination of rocapuldencel-T with sunitinib or other therapies had the potential to address this unmet need.


Development Status
 
We are conducting our pivotal Phase 3 ADAPT trial of rocapuldencel-T. We have previously conducted three clinical trials of rocapuldencel-T and its predecessor product, including a Phase 2 trial and two Phase 1 trials. To date, we have administered rocapuldencel-T to over 300 patients in these trials. We submitted to the FDA an investigational new drug application, or IND, for rocapuldencel-T in March 2003.
 
Pivotal Phase 3 ADAPT Trial of rocapuldencel-T. We are conducting the pivotal Phase 3 ADAPT clinical trial of rocapuldencel-T plus sunitinib/ targeted therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed mRCC under an SPA with the FDA. We dosed the first patient in May 2013 and completed enrollment of the trial in July 2015.
 
The ADAPT trial is a randomized, multicenter, open label trial of rocapuldencel-T in combination with sunitinib / targeted therapy compared to sunitinib / another therapy monotherapy. We enrolled 462 patients with the goal of generating 290 events for the primary endpoint of overall survival. We enrolled these patients at 107 clinical sites in North America, Europe and Israel. Under the ADAPT trial protocol, these patients were randomized between the rocapuldencel-T plus sunitinib / targeted therapy combination arm and the sunitinib / targeted monotherapy control arm on a two-to-one basis. The primary endpoint of the ADAPT trial is overall survival. Secondary endpoints include progression free survival, overall response rate and safety. In February 2017, the IDMC for the ADAPT trial recommended that the trial be discontinued for futility based on its planned interim data analysis. The IDMC concluded that the study was unlikely to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in overall survival in the combination treatment arm, utilizing the intent-to-treat population, the primary endpoint of the study. In conjunction with our clinical and scientific advisors, we are analyzing the preliminary ADAPT trial data set and plan to discuss the data with the FDA. We have continued to conduct the ADAPT trial while we conduct our ongoing data review and have discussions with FDA. We expect that we will make a determination as to the next steps for the rocapuldencel-T clinical program based on this review and discussions. .


Our design for the ADAPT trial required enrollment of adult patients who have been newly diagnosed with mRCC with primary tumor intact and metastatic disease following nephrectomy, who have predominantly clear cell RCC based upon the tumor collected at nephrectomy, and who have not received any prior therapies for RCC. Participating patients were required to be suitable candidates for sunitinib therapy and have either poor risk or intermediate risk disease at presentation, with the less than one year to treatment risk factor and not more than four Heng risk factors in total. As part of the ADAPT trial design, the two arms of the trial weree balanced based upon known prognostic risk factors. Patients were stratified by number of risk factors (1, 2, 3 or 4) as well as whether they had measurable versus non-measurable metastatic disease following nephrectomy. The patient population in the ADAPT trial is generally comparable to the patient population treated in our Phase 2 combination therapy clinical trial. Approximately 77% of the patients enrolled in the ADAPT trial are intermediate risk patients (1-2 risk factors) and 23% are poor risk (3-4 risk factors).

Under the ADAPT trial protocol, patients in the rocapuldencel-T plus sunitinib/ targeted therapy arm are dosed with rocapuldencel-T once every three weeks for five doses, followed by a booster dose every three months. In accordance with its label, sunitinib dosing is administered in six-week cycles, consisting of four weeks on drug and two weeks on drug holiday. Rocapuldencel-T dosing is initiated at the end of the initial six-week sunitinib cycle. The first dose of rocapuldencel-T is administered prior to the start of sunitinib dosing in the second sunitinib cycle. This dosing regimen is identical to the dosing regimen used in our Phase 2 combination therapy clinical trial of rocapuldencel-T and sunitinib, except that the start of the sixth dose is scheduled for week 24 to better provide patients the opportunity to receive a total of eight doses across 48 weeks. Patients in the sunitinib monotherapy control arm receive sunitinib on the same dosing schedule as patients receive sunitinib in the rocapuldencel-T-sunitinib combination arm.


Under the ADAPT trial protocol, rocapuldencel-T is administered for at least 48 weeks so that patients receive at least eight doses of rocapuldencel-T. Dosing will cease prior to 48 weeks if two events of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occur or upon the joint decision of the patient and the investigator. If after 48 weeks of dosing of rocapuldencel-T a patient has stable disease or is responding to treatment, dosing will continue once every three months until disease progression. If an investigator determines to discontinue sunitinib, either due to disease progression or toxicity, the investigator can, at any time during the ADAPT trial after the first six-week cycle of sunitinib, initiate second-line therapy with one of the other approved therapies, including pazopanib, axitinib, everolimus or temsirolimus. In the event of discontinuation of sunitinib for patients in the combination therapy arm, such patients would continue with rocapuldencel-T dosing in combination with the second-line therapy. In our Phase 2 combination therapy clinical trial, dosing ceased upon the first event of disease progression and second-line therapy was not permitted.
 
A graphic of the trial design is shown below.
 

Other Development Activities. We believe that rocapuldencel-T may be capable of treating a wide range of cancers and we are evaluating or plan to evaluate rocapuldencel-T in clinical trials in additional cancer indications. Development of rocapuldencel-T in these other indications will in part depend upon our ongoing review of the ADAPT study data and discussions with the FDA, and subject to us obtaining the financing necessary to support such trials.

• | We are supporting an investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate treatment with rocapuldencel-T in patients with early stage RCC prior to nephrectomy. This trial was opened for enrollment of patients in late 2014. Five patients have been enrolled in the trial as of March 16, 2017, with a total enrollment targeted for 10 patients. We expect that preliminary data for this study will be available in the second half of 2017.

Phase 2 Combination Therapy Clinical Trial. From July 2008 to October 2009, we enrolled 21 newly diagnosed mRCC patients in a single arm, multicenter, open label Phase 2 clinical trial of rocapuldencel-T in combination with sunitinib. We conducted this clinical trial at nine clinical sites in the United States and Canada. Our design for the trial required adult patients with previously untreated mRCC, no prior nephrectomy or at least one accessible lesion for biopsy, a histologically confirmed predominantly clear cell tumor, and suitability for sunitinib therapy. The primary endpoint of the trial was complete response rate. Secondary endpoints included progression free survival, overall survival, safety, clinical benefit rate and immune response.
 
Patients in the trial generally received one initial six-week cycle of sunitinib, consisting of four weeks on drug and two weeks on drug holiday, prior to initiating the combined treatment with rocapuldencel-T. Patients then received a dose of rocapuldencel-T every three weeks for a total of five doses, while also continuing three additional six-week cycles of sunitinib. This 24-week induction phase was followed by a booster phase during which patients received a dose of rocapuldencel-T once every three months and continued to receive sunitinib in six-week cycles until disease progression.
 
The following table summarizes certain key data from the 11 intermediate risk and 10 poor risk patients enrolled in the Phase 2 combination therapy clinical trial.
 

Outcome | | (N=21)
----------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------
Median OS (1) | 30.2 months 
Median PFS (2) | 11.2 months 
Complete response (3) | 0 patients 
Partial response (4) | 9 patients 
Stable disease (5) | 4 patients 
Immune response | CD8+ CD28+ memory T-cells correlated with OS, PFS and reduced metastatic tumor burden; IL-2 and interferon- g (IFN- g ) recovery 


_________________
 
(1) | Overall survival, or OS, is the length of time from the initiation of treatment to the patient’s death. 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | Progression free survival, or PFS, is the length of time from treatment initiation to the worsening of the patient’s disease or the patient’s death. 
(3) | Complete response is the disappearance of all measurable target lesions and non-target lesions. 
(4) | Partial response is the overall tumor regression based on a decrease of at least 30% in the overall amount of measurable tumor mass in the body and improvement or no change in non-target lesions. 
(5) | Stable disease is neither sufficient decrease in tumor size to qualify as a partial response nor sufficient increase in tumor size to qualify as disease progression. 

 
Particular observations from these data and the trial, which have informed our further clinical development of rocapuldencel-T, include:
 
Efficacy Analysis
 

• | Seven patients survived for more than 4.5 years following enrollment in this trial. Two of these patients remained alive as of December 31, 2016 and both have had a sustained clinical response spanning nearly eight years and remain on rocapuldencel-T in combination with continued targeted therapy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Five poor risk patients did not receive five doses of rocapuldencel-T due to early disease progression. Median overall survival in the 16 patients who received at least five doses of rocapuldencel-T was 36.0 months. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Median overall survival in the 11 intermediate risk patients was 61.9 months. Median overall survival in the 10 poor risk patients was 9.1 months.

• | Of the nine patients who exhibited a partial response, five patients exhibited partial responses during the 24-week induction phase, including two patients who exhibited partial responses prior to initiation of treatment with rocapuldencel-T. The other three patients exhibited partial responses after prolonged dosing with rocapuldencel-T during the booster phase. We do not believe that these late occurring partial responses have been observed in clinical trials of sunitinib alone. As a result, we believe that these late responses may relate to the immunologic effects of prolonged rocapuldencel-T dosing and rocapuldencel-T’s effect on CD8+ CD28+ memory T-cells. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We observed a statistically significant correlation between increased progression free survival and prolonged survival (p<0.001). Statistical significance is determined by methods that establish the p-value of the results. Typically, results are considered statistically significant if they have a p-value of 0.05 or less, meaning that there is less than a one-in-20 likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Immune Response Analysis
 

• | In the 14 patients in the trial who received at least five doses of rocapuldencel-T and could be evaluated for memory T-cell response, we observed a statistically significant correlation between the increase in the number of CD8+ CD28+ memory T-cells over the initial five doses of rocapuldencel-T and survival (p<0.002), progression free survival (p<0.031) and reduced metastatic tumor burden (p<0.045). The following graphics show, for each of these 14 patients, the increase in their tumor-specific memory T-cells that they exhibited as measured immediately prior to their first dose of rocapuldencel-T and immediately following the patient’s fifth dose of rocapuldencel-T, or the absence of such increase, as compared to such patient’s survival.

Phase 2 Combination Therapy Clinical Trial of rocapuldencel-T:
 Correlation of Immune Response and Overall Survival
 


• | Rocapuldencel-T was found to have positive impact on immune cell function and restoration of cellular immunity in a majority of patients, including an increase in levels of IL-2 and IFN- g. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Safety
 

• | The adverse events in this trial associated with rocapuldencel-T were generally only mild injection site reactions, while the toxicities associated with sunitinib were consistent with those expected from treatment with sunitinib alone. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The original design for the Phase 2 clinical trial called for the recruitment of 50 patients to generate 38 fully evaluable patients. However, in October 2009, we terminated enrollment in this trial early due to a lack of funding. As a result, only 21 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of rocapuldencel-T. In addition, the trial was originally designed to enroll patients with favorable and intermediate risk disease profiles. Instead, the actual population enrolled consisted entirely of patients with intermediate or poor risk disease profiles who had the less than one year to treatment risk factor. Because the patient population had poorer prognoses when they entered the trial than we expected and we did not have a sufficient number of evaluable patients, we did not perform the statistical analysis to determine whether the primary endpoint of complete response rate was achieved. As a result, if we submit a biologics license application, or BLA to the FDA for rocapuldencel-T, we expect the data from this trial to be considered by the FDA for the purpose of evaluating the safety and feasibility of rocapuldencel-T, but that it will only have a limited impact on the FDA’s ultimate assessment of the efficacy of rocapuldencel-T.


Based on our experience with the Phase 2 clinical trial, we concluded that the secondary endpoints in the trial, progression free survival and overall survival, along with immune response, were the appropriate endpoints to consider for measuring the efficacy of rocapuldencel-T in combination with sunitinib in patients with mRCC in our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial.
 
Rocapuldencel-T Phase 2 Combination Therapy Clinical Trial, as Compared to Independent Third Party mRCC Data. At ASCO in June 2013, Dr. Heng presented data from the Consortium database regarding overall survival and progression free survival for intermediate and poor risk patients treated with sunitinib and other targeted therapies, including data with respect to 1,189 intermediate and poor risk patients with the less than one year to treatment risk factor.

Using the overall survival data from the Consortium database presented in June 2013 and published in April 2014, a summary comparison of this data with our Phase 2 clinical trial of rocapuldencel-T in combination with sunitinib is set forth in the graphic below. This graphic compares the median overall survival data from the Consortium intermediate and poor risk patients with the less than one year to treatment risk factor with the median overall survival data from the 21 patients in our Phase 2 clinical trial of rocapuldencel-T in combination with sunitinib, all of whom had the less than one year to treatment risk factor. A majority of the Consortium patients and the patients in our Phase 2 clinical trial had one or more additional risk factors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Progression free survival for intermediate and poor risk patients in the Consortium database with the less than one year to treatment risk factor was 5.6 months, as compared to the 11.2 months of median progression free survival that we observed in the 21 patients in our Phase 2 clinical trial of rocapuldencel-T in combination with sunitinib.
 
Although we believe comparisons between our data and these collections of data are useful in evaluating the overall results of our Phase 2 clinical trial, the treatment of the Consortium patients was conducted at different sites, at different times and in different patient populations than the treatment in our Phase 2 combination therapy trial. The treatment also differed because certain of the Consortium patients received therapies other than sunitinib as first-line treatment. All of the patients in our Phase 2 clinical trial received sunitinib as first-line treatment. Our ongoing pivotal Phase 3 combination therapy clinical trial of rocapuldencel-T is the first trial that we have conducted that directly compares rocapuldencel-T and sunitinib or other targeted therapies as a combination therapy against sunitinib as monotherapy. Results of this head-to-head comparison in our phase 3 ADAPT trial differed significantly from the comparisons presented above and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


AGS-004 for the Treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus
 
We are developing AGS-004, our second Arcelis-based product candidate, for the treatment of HIV. We have completed three clinical trials of AGS-004. These include Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials that were funded by government grants and a Phase 2b trial that was funded in full by the NIH.
 
Based on the clinical data that we have generated to date, we have determined to focus our development program on the use of AGS-004 in combination with other therapies to achieve complete virus eradication and the use of AGS-004 monotherapy to provide long-term control of HIV viral load in immunologically healthy patients and eliminate their need for ART.
 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus
 
HIV is characterized by a chronic viral infection and an associated deterioration of immune function. Specifically, the virus disables and kills crucial human immune cells called CD4+ T-cells. CD4+ T-cells are necessary to generate and maintain antiviral T-cells, including the CD8+CD28+ memory T cells that aid in the killing of virus-infected cells. Over time, this viral impact on an infected person’s immune system outpaces the body’s natural ability to replace CD4+ T-cells and immunodeficiency results. As a result, the longer a person has been infected with the virus, the more functionally impaired these cells become.

15
--

 
At the same time, HIV infection causes the immune cells in HIV patients, including CD4+ T-cells and CD8+ T-cells that are not killed by the virus, to be in a chronic state of activation. The persistent state of immune activation in HIV patients results in chronic inflammation. We believe that this inflammation plays a role in the elevated rates of age-related comorbidities, including malignancies and cardiovascular disease observed in HIV patients. In addition, the activation of the CD4+ T-cells supports virus replication which leads to the production of new virus and increased viral load.
 
HIV is a persistent virus that can rapidly adapt to its environment by mutating and creating HIV variants that are drug resistant and can evade immune attack. As a result, there are a large number of mutated variants of HIV existing in any one infected individual and no two individuals have identical viral sequences.
 
According to the World Health Organization, the number of people living with HIV in the world was approximately 35 million in 2013. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 1.2 million people are currently living with HIV in the United States and the number of new cases of HIV infection in the United States is expected to remain constant at approximately 50,000 cases per year.
 
Current treatments for HIV. In 1996, triple combinations of oral medications known as ART were demonstrated to substantially reduce the levels of virus in the blood of patients with HIV. Since then, the introduction of new drug classes of ART and combination drug treatment strategies has enhanced treatment for HIV.
 
ART in HIV-infected patients can decrease levels of HIV in the blood to below the limits of detection, increase life expectancy and improve quality of life. However, there continues to be an unmet need for HIV therapies for the following reasons:
 

• | ART can have significant side effects. The most recent U.S. guidelines on ART treatment contain a number of tables of adverse effects of combination regimens and how to manage them. Some combinations present potentially life-threatening complications and other complications that are chronic, cumulative and overlapping, and sometimes irreversible. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ART requires life-long daily treatment. The risks of long-term daily administration of ART remain unknown but are potentially significant. In addition, the requirement for life-long daily treatment has made strict adherence to the treatment regime difficult. Poor compliance has led to the development of drug resistant HIV variants that are ineffectively controlled by the available armamentarium of ART. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ART cannot eradicate the virus and, therefore, does not cure HIV-infected patients. For example, up to 20% of patients receiving ART fail to achieve normal CD4+ T-cell counts, resulting in a continued weakened immune system. In addition, certain patients are not able to achieve effective control of the virus using current treatment regimens. ART cannot eradicate the virus because the virus persists in latently infected cells. These cells, which constitute the HIV latent reservoir, do not consistently express HIV antigens in a manner or a compartment that permits effective control. Instead, these cells serve as a source privileged from ART control for virus replication and viral rebound in the absence of ART. Following discontinuation of treatment with ART, HIV viral levels return to levels observed prior to treatment with ART within 12 weeks of treatment interruption.

AGS-004 Opportunity
 
We believe, based on the mechanism of action of AGS-004 and the clinical data that we have generated, that AGS-004 has the potential to address this unmet need for the following reasons:

• | Potential to Eradicate HIV in Combination with Latency Reversing Drugs. A number of companies and academic groups are evaluating drugs that can potentially activate the latently infected cells to increase viral antigen expression and make the cells vulnerable to elimination by the immune system. We believe that treating HIV-infected patients, who are being successfully treated with ART, with a combination of AGS-004 and one of these latency reversing drugs could lead to activation of antigen expression from the latently infected cells along with a potent memory T-cell response that is specific to the patient’s own unique viral antigens. We believe that this approach could potentially result in complete eradication of the patient’s virus. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Long-Term Viral Load Control in Immunologically Healthy Patients. We believe that AGS-004 may allow for long-term virus control and eliminate the need for life-long treatment with ART in infected patients who have minimal immune suppression but no T-cell response against their virus. We have designed AGS-004 to induce CD8+ CD28+ memory T-cells that are specific to the patient’s own unique viral antigens, do not require CD4+ T-cell help to kill viral cells and do not result in CD4+ T-cell activation which typically increases viral replication and viral load. As reported in Clinical & Experimental Immunology, researchers have demonstrated that elevated levels of CD8+CD28+ memory T-cells in the blood are a statistically significant predictor of long-term non-progression in HIV-infected patients not treated with ART drugs. As a result, we believe that inducing these memory T-cells may lead to viral control. Patients with minimal immune suppression and no T-cell response include pediatric patients who have been successfully treated with ART drugs since birth or shortly thereafter and have generally healthy immune systems. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Minimal Toxicity. AGS-004 has been well tolerated in clinical trials with no serious adverse events being attributed to it. As a result, we believe we can combine AGS-004 with other HIV therapies without additional toxicities. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lack of Chronic Inflammation. We have designed AGS-004 to elicit a patient-specific and disease-specific immune response that does not cause any additional inflammation. In our clinical trials of AGS-004, AGS-004 has not induced changes in markers that are associated with chronic inflammation in HIV patients.

Description and Development Status
 
AGS-004 is an individualized immunotherapy based on our Arcelis precision immunotherapy technology platform. It is produced by electroporating dendritic cells with mRNA encoding for patient-specific HIV antigens that have been derived from a patient’s virus-infected blood and with RNA that encodes the CD40L protein. The process for producing AGS-004 is the same process as is used to produce rocapuldencel-T, with the one key difference being that rocapuldencel-T contains all of the antigens from a patient’s tumor cells while AGS-004 contains potentially all variants unique to each individual patient of four selected HIV antigens (Gag, Nef, Vpr and Rev). We designed AGS-004 to include these antigens because immunity to them has been observed in long-term non-progressors and elite controllers, two groups of rare patients able to control virus replication without ART. Because no two patients share identical HIV antigen sequences and there are a large number of mutated variants of HIV existing in each infected patient, by using mRNA that is specific to the patient’s virus and that captures potentially all of the unique patient-specific variants of each antigen in the sample obtained, we believe our immunotherapy maximizes the relevance of the immune responses induced in each patient.
 We have conducted three clinical trials of AGS-004, which include:
 

· | a phase 2b clinical trial of AGS-004; 
--+------------------------------------------
· | a phase 2a clinical trial of AGS-004; and
· | a phase 1 clinical trial of AGS-004. 

 
We submitted to the FDA an IND for AGS-004 in August 2008.
 
We are focusing our development program for AGS-004 on the use of AGS-004 in combination with latency reversing therapies to achieve complete virus eradication. Latently infected cells differ from other infected cells in that the HIV genome is permanently integrated into the chromosomal DNA of the latently infected cells. These latently infected cells persist long-term and constitute the HIV latent reservoir, which serves as a source privileged from ART control for virus replication and viral rebound in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. As a result, demonstration that latently infected cells can be targeted by immune responses induced by AGS-004 is essential to our development strategy pertaining to virus eradication.
 
Adult Eradication Trial. We are supporting an investigator-initiated clinical trial of AGS-004 in 12 adult HIV patients who are being treated with ART to evaluate the use of AGS-004 to eradicate the virus. The trial is being conducted by co-investigator Dr. David Margolis, Professor of Medicine at the University of North Carolina. Dr. Margolis is the leader of CARE, and has been a pioneer in the research of HIV latent reservoir reversing treatments. The trial is being conducted in two stages. Stage 1 of this trial has been completed and was designed to study immune response kinetics to AGS-004 in patients on continuous ART. These data were used to better define the optimal dosing strategy in combination with a latency reversing therapy in the ongoing Stage 2. We expect that some patients in Stage 1 will rollover into Stage 2, which is studying AGS-004 in combination with one of the latency reversing drugs. The patient clinical costs for the first stage of this trial were funded by CARE. The NIH Division of AIDS has approved $6.6 million in funding for the second stage of this trial.
Planned Pediatric Functional Cure Trial. We believe that a patient population that could benefit from AGS-004 monotherapy consists of 14+ year old, HIV-infected individuals who have been treated with ART since birth or shortly thereafter. These individuals are characterized by having very small HIV latent reservoirs and otherwise healthy immune systems, while lacking antiviral CD8+ CD28+ memory T-cell responses. We believe that successfully inducing antiviral CD8+ CD28+ memory T-cell responses in these patients could allow for long-term viral load control and eliminate the need for life-long antiretroviral therapy. We plan to support an investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial of AGS-004 in pediatric HIV patients to evaluate the use of AGS-004 monotherapy to allow for long-term control of viral load and eliminate the need for ART. We are currently developing the clinical protocol for this trial to immunize pediatric HIV patients who were infected at birth and treated with antiretroviral therapy at or near birth. We are developing this clinical protocol in collaboration with Drs. Katherine Luzuriaga, University of Massachusetts, and Deborah Persaud, John Hopkins Medical Center, both specializing in pediatric virology. The commencement of this trial is subject to supportive data obtained from the adult eradication trial and approval of the protocol by the principal investigator(s), institutional review boards, the IMPAACT Network leadership and the FDA and to the agreement by the NIH to fund the trial costs not related to AGS-004 manufacturing. Assuming the supportive data and the necessary approvals are obtained, we expect this trial to open in 2017.
Phase 2b Clinical Trial. In January 2015, we completed a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind Phase 2b clinical trial of AGS-004 in chronically infected patients on ART that we opened for enrollment in July 2010. We designed this trial to confirm the data obtained in an earlier Phase 2a clinical trial in which AGS-004 led to a reduction in virus replication. We initially planned to enroll 42 chronically infected patients in the Phase 2b trial at nine clinical sites in the United States and Canada with the intent to generate 36 events for the primary endpoint analysis. However, due to a higher than anticipated dropout rate by patients who were unable to complete the full 12 week treatment interruption period provided for by the trial, we needed to enroll 53 patients in the trial to generate 36 events for the primary endpoint analysis. These patients were randomized between AGS-004 treatment and a placebo control on a two-to-one basis.


HIV infection is classified as “chronic” or “acute” based on how long the patient has been infected prior to starting ART. Patients with chronic HIV infection are patients who have initiated ART after at least six months from the time of initial infection. Patients with acute HIV infection are patients who have initiated ART less than 45 days after initial infection. This trial enrolled adult patients with chronic HIV-1 infection and undetectable viral loads as a result of treatment with ART. Patients also had to have adequate CD4+ T-cell counts and a pre-ART plasma viral sample to be used to manufacture AGS-004.

In this trial, patients first received intradermal doses of AGS-004 or placebo every four weeks for a total of four doses, together with their ART. Following the fourth dose of AGS-004 or placebo, patients discontinued their ART but continued to receive AGS-004 or placebo every four weeks for 12 weeks. We refer to this period as the treatment interruption period. Patients who demonstrated control of viral replication under 10,000 copies/ml and maintained CD4+ T-cell counts above 350 cells/mm 3 could remain off ART and continue their treatment interruption past 12 weeks. Following the end of treatment interruption, all patients were eligible for continued treatment with the combination of AGS-004 and ART. A schematic of the trial design is shown below.
 
Phase 2b Study Design for the Chronically Infected Cohort
 

The primary endpoint of the trial was a comparison of the median viral load in the AGS-004-treated patients with the median viral load in patients receiving placebo after 12 weeks of ART treatment interruption. Under this protocol, the primary endpoint required that there was a ³ 1.1 log 10 difference in median viral load between the AGS-004-treated cohort compared to the placebo-treated cohort. A 1.1 log 10 reduction means a 92% lower virus concentration in the AGS-004-treated cohort compared to the placebo-treated cohort. Secondary endpoints included comparisons between AGS-004-treated patients and the patients receiving placebo with respect to change in viral load from pre-ART to the end of 12 weeks of treatment interruption, duration of treatment interruption, changes in CD4+ T-cell counts and safety.
 
In September 2011, we added to the trial a single arm, open-label, unblinded cohort of up to 12 patients with acute HIV-1 infection and undetectable viral loads as a result of treatment with ART. We evaluated AGS-004 in this patient population to assess AGS-004 in patients who initiated ART during the acute phase of infection and as a result may have sustained less immune damage. Patients in this cohort were dosed in the same manner as patients in the chronically infected arm of the clinical trial. However, in this cohort, patients had to demonstrate a positive CD8+ CD28+ anti-HIV memory T-cell response in order to become eligible to enter the 12 week treatment interruption period. The primary endpoints for this cohort included the time to detectable viral load during the ART interruption period and comparison of changes in CD4+ T-cell counts during the ART interruption period between the acute cohort and the chronic cohort. Six patients were enrolled in this cohort. All six patients demonstrated a positive CD8+ CD28+ memory T-cell response and initiated treatment interruption. For the five of six patients that re-initiated ART after treatment interruption, there were no significant declines in CD4+ T cells between the interruption date and the re-initiation date. All six patients experienced viral rebound during treatment interruption with the times to detectable viral load ranging from two to eight weeks and the duration of treatment interruption for those patients who reinitiated ART ranged from approximately one month to approximately nine months. In addition, three of six patients had a decrease in circulating CD4+ T cells containing HIV DNA of 25%, 47% and 63%, respectively, when measured after three doses of AGS-004 while on ART.
 
In the Phase 2b trial, 54 patients received the full four doses of AGS-004 or placebo during the first four weeks together with their ART. Of these patients, 36 patients continued on AGS-004 or placebo for the full 12-week treatment interruption period, 23 of whom received AGS-004.
 
In January 2015, we announced top-line results from the trial. The primary endpoint of the trial was not achieved.
 
However, we believe that data from the trial provided evidence of the ability of AGS-004 to induce memory T-cell responses which may have directly impacted the latent viral reservoir. Of the evaluated 22 patients who received AGS-004 and completed the 12-week treatment interruption period, 15 patients, or approximately 70 percent, had positive antiviral memory T-cell responses prior to beginning the treatment interruption versus zero percent of placebo patients. Within the AGS-004 treatment group, those patients that had antiviral memory T-cell responses had significantly fewer CD4+ T-cells with integrated HIV DNA when compared to non-responders. These findings relate directly to the utilization of AGS-004 in our ongoing adult eradication study and our planned pediatric study, where one of the key objectives is to decrease the latent HIV reservoir.
 
Safety analysis
 
In this trial, AGS-004 was well tolerated. No AGS-004-related serious adverse events were reported. The most common adverse event was mild injection site reactions. During the antiretroviral treatment interruption, no notable differences in incidence of adverse events occurred compared to when patients were receiving AGS-004 in combination with antiretroviral drug therapy.
 
NIH and NIAID Contract. Our development of AGS-004 has received significant funding from the U.S. federal government. In September 2006, we entered into a multi-year research contract with the NIH and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, to design, develop and clinically test an autologous HIV immunotherapy capable of eliciting therapeutic immune responses. We are using funds from this contract to develop AGS-004. Under this contract, as it has been amended, the NIH and the NIAID have committed to fund up to $39.8 million, including reimbursement of our direct expenses and allocated overhead and general and administrative expenses of up to $38.4 million and payment of specified amounts totaling up to $1.4 million upon our achievement of specified development milestones. We have recorded total revenue of $38.1 million through December 31, 2016 under the NIH agreement. As of December 31, 2016, there was up to $1.9 million of potential revenue remaining to be earned under the agreement. This commitment extends until July 2018.

We have agreed to a statement of work under the contract, and are obligated to furnish all the services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the U.S. government, needed to perform the statement of work. In accordance with the laws applicable to government intellectual property rights under federal contracts, we have a right under our contract with the NIH to elect to retain title to inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under the NIH and NIAID contract, subject to the right of the U.S. government to a royalty-free license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States the subject invention throughout the world. The government also has special statutory “march-in” rights to license or to require us to license such inventions to third parties under limited circumstances. In addition, we may not grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any such inventions in the United States unless such person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States.
 
Manufacturing
 
We currently manufacture our Arcelis-based products, rocapuldencel-T and AGS-004, for use in our clinical trials of those product candidates at our facilities in Durham, North Carolina, which we refer to as our Technology Drive and Patriot Center facilities. These facilities include manufacturing suites for the production of products using our Arcelis technology platform. We have designed these suites to comply with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements. We have manufactured the product for our development and clinical trial activities associated with rocapuldencel-T and AGS-004 to date, and are manufacturing the product for the ADAPT trial using our current processes at our current facilities.
 
In January 2017, we entered into a ten-year lease agreement with two five-year renewal options for 40,000 square feet of manufacturing and office space at the Center for Technology Innovation, or CTI, on the Centennial Campus of North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina. We had intended to utilize this facility to manufacture rocapuldencel-T to support submission of a BLA to the FDA and to support initial commercialization of rocapuldencel-T.


To provide for capacity expansion beyond the initial few years following potential launch of rocapuldencel-T, we had planned for the build-out and equip a second facility, which we refer to as the Centerpoint facility. In August 2014, we entered into a ten-year lease agreement with renewal options. Under the lease agreement, we agreed to lease certain land and an approximately 125,000 square-foot building to be constructed in Durham County, North Carolina. We initially intended this facility to house our corporate headquarters and commercial manufacturing before we entered into the lease for the CTI facility. The shell of the new facility was constructed on a build-to-suit basis in accordance with agreed upon specifications and plans and was completed in June 2015. However, the build-out and equipping of the interior of the facility was suspended as we pursued financing arrangements.
 
Due to the recent IDMC recommendation to discontinue the ADAPT study, we are currently reassessing our manufacturing plans. We have therefore initiated discussions with the landlords of our CTI facility and our Centerpoint facility regarding these leases. We believe that our current Technology Drive and Patriot Center facilities are sufficient for the manufacture of rocapuldencel-T and AGS-004 to support our ongoing clinical trials and any likely near-term clinical trials that we may initiate.


We have granted exclusive manufacturing rights for rocapuldencel-T to Pharmstandard in Russia and the other states comprising the Commonwealth of Independent States, to Green Cross in South Korea, to Medinet in Japan and to Lummy HK in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. We have also agreed to enter into an agreement with Pharmstandard for the manufacture of rocapuldencel-T in the European market.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We hold exclusive commercial rights to all of our product candidates in all geographies other than rights to rocapuldencel-T in Russia and the other states comprising the Commonwealth of Independent States, which are held by Pharmstandard, rights to rocapuldencel-T for the treatment of mRCC in South Korea, which are held by Green Cross and rights to rocapuldencel-T in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau, which are held by Lummy HK. We have granted to Medinet an exclusive license to manufacture in Japan rocapuldencel-T for the treatment of mRCC.
 
We currently intend to retain North American marketing rights for rocapuldencel-T and any future oncology products that we may develop. To maximize the value of these rights, we would expect to build a commercial infrastructure for such products comprised of medical, marketing and sales teams as well as a customer service function to manage patient access and logistics partners associated with rocapuldencel-T production and distribution. Our commercial infrastructure would also include personnel who manage reimbursement activities with third party payors, such as managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, oncology group networks and government accounts. We currently have limited commercial capabilities and few in-house personnel specializing in these functions. Outside North America, we plan to seek to enter into collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology firms to commercialize rocapuldencel-T.
 
For AGS-004, we plan to seek to enter into collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology firms to commercialize this product candidate on a worldwide basis.

Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities and research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to or competitive with our products. There are a number of multinational pharmaceutical companies and large biotechnology companies currently marketing or pursuing the development of products or product candidates targeting the same indications as our product candidates. It is probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of unmet needs in these indications will increase. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approaches, and others are based on entirely different approaches.
 
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Our competitors’ drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third party payors.
 
mRCC
 
Historically, mRCC was treated with chemotherapy, radiation and hormonal therapies, as well as cytokine-based therapies such as interferon- µ and IL-2. More recently, the FDA has approved several targeted therapies as monotherapies for mRCC, including Nexavar (sorafenib), marketed by Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Sutent (sunitinib) and Inlyta (axitinib), marketed by Pfizer, Inc.; Avastin (bevacizumab), marketed by Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group; Votrient (pazopanib) and Afinitor (everolimus), marketed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation; Torisel (temsirolimus), marketed by Pfizer and most recently, Opdivo (nivolumab), marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Cabometyx (cabozantinib), marketed by Exelixis, for second-line mRCC. In addition, we estimate that there are numerous therapies for mRCC in clinical development by many public and private biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies targeting numerous different cancer types and stages. A number of these are in late stage development including Opdivo (nivolumab) plus Yervoy (ipilimumab) in combination for first-line mRCC, which are currently being compared in a Phase 3 trial to sunitinib. In addition, if a standalone therapy for mRCC were developed that demonstrated improved efficacy over currently marketed first-line therapies with a favorable safety profile and without the need for combination therapy, such a therapy might pose a significant competitive threat to rocapuldencel-T.
 
Other Oncology Indications
 
We estimate that there are numerous other cancer immunotherapy products in clinical development by many public and private biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies targeting numerous different cancer types. A number of these product candidates are in late-stage clinical development or have recently been approved in different cancer types including two recently approved checkpoint inhibitor-based immunotherapies, Nivolumab which is marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pembrolizumab, which is marketed by Merck. These newer immunotherapies are in addition to the targeted therapies, chemotherapeutics, radiation therapy, hormonal therapies and cytokine-based therapies used in the treatment in a wide range of oncology indications.
HIV
 
There are numerous FDA-approved treatments for HIV, primarily antiretroviral therapies, marketed by large pharmaceutical companies. In addition, generic competition has recently developed as patent exclusivity periods for older drugs have expired, with more than 15 generic bioequivalents currently on the market. The presence of these generic drugs is resulting in price pressure in the HIV therapeutics market. Currently, there are no approved therapies for the eradication of HIV. We expect that major pharmaceutical companies that currently market antiretroviral therapy products or other companies that are developing HIV product candidates may seek to develop products for the eradication of HIV.
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We are seeking a range of patent and other protections for our product candidates and platform technology. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
Patents
 
We own or exclusively license 14 U.S. patents and five U.S. patent applications, as well as approximately 60 foreign counterparts, covering our Arcelis precision immunotherapy technology platform and Arcelis-based product candidates.
 
We use our Arcelis precision immunotherapy technology platform to generate individualized mRNA-loaded dendritic cell immunotherapies. As described above, the process of obtaining a disease sample and dendritic cells from a patient, using those materials to manufacture an individualized drug product and shipping the drug product to the clinical site for use in the treatment of the patient involves many important steps. These steps include:
 

20
--


• | amplifying mRNA from a disease sample obtained from the patient;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | differentiating dendritic cell precursors (monocytes) isolated from the patient into immature dendritic cells; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maturing the immature dendritic cells in culture and loading the mature dendritic cells with the amplified mRNA and CD40L protein; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | formulating the matured, loaded dendritic cells in the patient’s plasma with cryoprotectants to protect the cells in the resulting drug product when the drug product is frozen and thawed. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have sought to protect these steps or the equipment related to carrying out one or more of these steps through patents or trade secrets. We have also sought to protect the resultant drug product through patents.
 
These patents and patent applications are directed to one or more aspects of our Arcelis precision immunotherapy technology platform or Arcelis-based products. Specifically, these patents and patent applications are collectively directed to:
 

• | Arcelis-based compositions of matter and products;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | methods of manufacturing Arcelis-based products;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | methods of using Arcelis-based products for treatment of tumors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | compositions that we use in the manufacture of Arcelis-based AGS-004 products; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | equipment would be used for assisting the automated manufacture of Arcelis-based products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that all of the above aspects of our Arcelis precision immunotherapy technology platform are required to successfully and efficiently produce our Arcelis-based product candidates and are covered by a combination of our patents, patent applications, trade secrets and know-how. The U.S. patents expire between 2021 and 2029, and the U.S. patent applications, if issued, would expire between 2025 and 2029, the counterpart patents in Europe and Japan expire between 2017 and 2027, and the counterpart patent applications in Europe and Japan, if issued, would expire between 2025 and 2027. Included in these patents and patent applications are:
 

• | two European patents and two Japanese patents that are collectively directed toward the composition of matter of Arcelis-based products (dendritic cells loaded with RNA from tumors or pathogens), and methods of manufacture of these products. The patents in Europe and Japan expire in 2017. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | six U.S. patents, one U.S. patent application and corresponding patent application in Europe and patent in Japan collectively directed towards an automated apparatus for the manipulation of nucleic acids in a closed container, components thereof and related methods of use. The U.S. and Japanese patents expire in 2027, and the patent applications in the United States and Europe, if issued, would expire in 2027. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | one U.S. patent and corresponding European and Japanese patents collectively directed towards cryoconserved dendritic cells and related methods of manufacture. The U.S., European and Japanese patents expire in 2021. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | four U.S. patents and two U.S. patent applications, two corresponding European patents, two corresponding Japanese patents and a corresponding patent application in Europe collectively directed towards methods of maturing dendritic cells and the composition of matter of dendritic cells that have undergone this maturation process. The U.S. patents expire in 2026 and the U.S. applications, if issued, would expire in 2025, the European patents expire in 2025 and 2027, the Japanese patents expire in 2025 and 2027 and the patent application in Europe, if issued, would expire in 2025. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | one U.S. patent and corresponding patent application in Europe and patent in Japan collectively directed towards methods of manufacture of dendritic cells from monocytes stored for more than six hours and up to four days without freezing and the composition of matter of dendritic cells that have been manufactured from these monocytes. The U.S. patent will expire in 2029, the Japanese patent will expire in 2026 and the patent application in Europe, if issued, would expire in 2026. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | one U.S. patent and one U.S. patent application, two patents in Europe and one patent in Japan are collectively directed towards the composition of matter of AGS-004 and related methods of manufacture. The U.S. patent expires in 2026. The U.S. patent application if issued, would expire in 2025. The European and Japanese patents will expire in 2025. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | one U.S. patent and one U.S. patent application are directed towards the composition of matter and related methods of use of some of the primers that we use in the manufacture of AGS-004. The U.S. patent and U.S. patent application, if issued, will expire in 2028. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, if the use of Arcelis-based products for the treatment of RCC and HIV are approved by the FDA, then, depending upon factors such as the timing and duration of FDA review and the timing and conditions of FDA approval, as well as factors such as patent claim scope, some of our issued U.S. patents (or patents that may issue from our pending U.S. patent applications) may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act.
 
Trade Secrets
 
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of the process by which we manufacture or plan to automate manufacturing of our Arcelis-based drug product candidates are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Key Licenses
 
We are party to a number of license agreements that are important to our business.
 
Duke University. Pursuant to a 2000 agreement with Duke University, we hold an exclusive worldwide license to specified patents, patent applications and know-how owned or otherwise controlled by Duke, including for use in the development, manufacture and commercialization of dendritic cells loaded with tumor or pathogen RNA. Under the agreement, we:

• | must pay all costs of prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patent rights; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | must pay an annual minimum royalty to Duke beginning with the calendar year beginning the second January 1 after first approval of a licensed product approved by the FDA or a comparable regulatory authority in a foreign country or any sale of a licensed product that does not require regulatory approval; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | must pay low single-digit percentage royalties, subject to reduction in specified circumstances, to Duke on net sales of licensed products, which are creditable against the annual minimum royalty. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are required to use reasonable commercial diligence to research, develop and market licensed products, to develop manufacturing capabilities, and to sublicense those patent rights for applications which we are not pursuing. If we fail to satisfy these obligations and do not cure such failure after receiving written notice from Duke, Duke may terminate the agreement or convert it to a nonexclusive license.
 
We may terminate our agreement with Duke at any time upon three months’ written notice. The agreement will terminate upon expiration of the last to expire of the patent rights licensed under the agreement. The U.S. patents licensed under the agreement expired in April 2016 and the patents licensed under the agreement in Europe and Japan expire April 30, 2017. Either party may terminate the agreement upon written notice for fraud, willful misconduct or illegal conduct of the other party that materially adversely affects the terminating party. If either party fails to fulfill any of its material obligations under the agreement, subject to a cure process specified in the agreement, the non-breaching party may terminate the agreement. A party’s ability to cure a breach will only apply to the first two breaches. In addition, the agreement will terminate if we become insolvent, bankrupt or placed in the hands of a receiver or trustee.
 
Development and Commercialization Agreements
 
An important part of our business strategy is to enter into arrangements with third parties for the development and commercialization of our product candidates.
 
Pharmstandard. In August 2013, in connection with the purchase of shares of our series E preferred stock by Pharmstandard, we entered into an exclusive royalty-bearing license agreement with Pharmstandard. Under this license agreement, we granted Pharmstandard and its affiliates a license, with the right to sublicense, to develop, manufacture and commercialize rocapuldencel-T and other products for the treatment of human diseases, which are developed by Pharmstandard using our individualized immunotherapy platform, in the Russian Federation, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, which we refer to as the Pharmstandard Territory. We also provided Pharmstandard with a right of first negotiation for development and commercialization rights in the Pharmstandard Territory to specified additional products we may develop.
 
Under the terms of the license agreement, Pharmstandard licensed us rights to clinical data generated by Pharmstandard under the agreement and granted us an option to obtain an exclusive license outside of the Pharmstandard Territory to develop and commercialize improvements to our Arcelis technology generated by Pharmstandard under the agreement, a non-exclusive worldwide royalty-free license to Pharmstandard improvements to manufacture products using our Arcelis technology and a license to specified follow-on licensed products generated by Pharmstandard outside of the Pharmstandard Territory, each on terms to be negotiated upon our request for a license. In addition, Pharmstandard agreed to pay us pass-through royalties on net sales of all licensed products in the low single digits until it has generated a specified amount of aggregate net sales. Once the net sales threshold is achieved, Pharmstandard will pay us royalties on net sales of specified licensed products, including rocapuldencel-T, in the low double digits below 20%. These royalty obligations last until the later of the expiration of specified licensed patent rights in a country or the twelfth anniversary of the first commercial sale in such country on a country by country basis and no further royalties on specified other licensed products. After the net sales threshold is achieved, Pharmstandard has the right to offset a portion of the royalties Pharmstandard pays to third parties for licenses to necessary third party intellectual property against the royalties that Pharmstandard pays to us.

The agreement will terminate upon expiration of the royalty term, upon which all licenses will become fully paid up perpetual exclusive licenses. Either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or if specified conditions occur relating to the other party’s insolvency or bankruptcy and we may terminate the agreement if Pharmstandard challenges or assists a third party in challenging specified patent rights of ours. If Pharmstandard terminates the agreement upon our material breach or bankruptcy, Pharmstandard is entitled to terminate our licenses to improvements generated by Pharmstandard, upon which we may come to rely for the development and commercialization of rocapuldencel-T and other licensed products outside of the Pharmstandard Territory, and Pharmstandard is entitled to retain its licenses from us and to pay us substantially reduced royalty payments following such termination.
 
In November 2013, we entered into an agreement with Pharmstandard under which Pharmstandard purchased additional shares of our series E preferred stock. Under this agreement, we agreed to enter into a manufacturing rights agreement for the European market with Pharmstandard and that the manufacturing rights agreement would provide for the issuance of warrants to Pharmstandard to purchase 499,788 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $5.82 per share. As of March 16, 2017, we had not entered into this manufacturing rights agreement or issued the warrants.
 
Green Cross.  In July 2013, in connection with the purchase of our series E preferred stock by Green Cross, we entered into an exclusive royalty-bearing license agreement with Green Cross. Under this agreement we granted Green Cross a license to develop, manufacture and commercialize rocapuldencel-T for mRCC in South Korea. We also provided Green Cross with a right of first negotiation for development and commercialization rights in South Korea to specified additional products we may develop.
 
Under the terms of the license, Green Cross has agreed to pay us $500,000 upon the initial submission of an application for regulatory approval of a licensed product in South Korea, $500,000 upon the initial regulatory approval of a licensed product in South Korea and royalties ranging from the mid-single digits to low double digits below 20% on net sales until the fifteenth anniversary of the first commercial sale in South Korea. In addition, Green Cross has granted us an exclusive royalty free license to develop and commercialize all Green Cross improvements to our licensed intellectual property in the rest of the world, excluding South Korea, except that, as to such improvements for which Green Cross makes a significant financial investment and that generate significant commercial benefit in the rest of the world, we are required to negotiate in good faith a reasonable royalty that we will be obligated to pay to Green Cross for such license. Under the terms of the agreement, we are required to continue to develop and to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain regulatory approval for rocapuldencel-T in the United States.


The agreement will terminate upon expiration of the royalty term, which is 15 years from the first commercial sale, upon which all licenses will become fully paid up perpetual non-exclusive licenses. Either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or if specified conditions occur relating to the other party’s insolvency or bankruptcy and we may terminate the agreement if Green Cross challenges or assists a third party in challenging specified patent rights of ours. If Green Cross terminates the agreement upon our material breach or bankruptcy, Green Cross is entitled to terminate our licenses to improvements and retain its licenses from us and to pay us substantially reduced milestone and royalty payments following such termination.
 
Medinet. In December 2013, we entered into a license agreement with Medinet. Under this agreement, we granted Medinet an exclusive, royalty-free license to manufacture in Japan rocapuldencel-T and other products using our Arcelis technology solely for the purpose of the development and commercialization of rocapuldencel-T and these other products for the treatment of mRCC. We refer to this license as the manufacturing license. In addition, under this agreement, we granted Medinet an option to acquire a nonexclusive, royalty-bearing license under our Arcelis technology to sell in Japan rocapuldencel-T and other products for the treatment of mRCC. We refer to the option as the sale option and the license as the sale license.
 
The sale option expired on April 30, 2016. As a result, Medinet may only manufacture rocapuldencel-T and these other products for us or our designee. We have agreed to negotiate in good faith a supply agreement under which Medinet would supply us or our designee with rocapuldencel-T and these other products for development and sale for the treatment of mRCC in Japan. During the term of the manufacturing license, we may not manufacture rocapuldencel-T or these other products for us or any designee for development or sale for the treatment of mRCC in Japan.
 
In consideration for the manufacturing license, Medinet paid us $1.0 million. Medinet also loaned us $9.0 million in connection with us entering into the agreement. We have agreed to use these funds in the development and manufacturing of rocapuldencel-T and the other products. Medinet also agreed to pay us milestone payments of up to a total of $9.0 million upon the achievement of developmental and regulatory milestones and $5.0 million upon the achievement of a sales milestone related to rocapuldencel-T and these products.


We borrowed the $9.0 million pursuant to an unsecured promissory note that bears interest at a rate of 3.0 % per annum. The principal and interest under the note are due and payable on December 31, 2018. Under the terms of the note and the manufacturing license agreement, any milestone payments related to the developmental and regulatory milestones that become due will be applied first to the repayment of the loan. The first milestone with a $1.0 million payment was achieved in July 2015 and the second milestone with a $2.0 million payment was achieved in June 2016, reducing the outstanding principal of the loan as of December 31, 2016 to $6.0 million. We have the right to prepay the loan at any time. If we have not repaid the loan by December 31, 2018, then we have agreed to grant to Medinet a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license to make and sell Arcelis products in Japan for the treatment of cancer. In such event, the amounts owing under the loan as of December 31, 2018 may constitute pre-paid royalties under the license or would be due and payable. Royalties under this license would be paid until the expiration of the licensed patent rights in Japan at a rate to be negotiated. If we cannot agree on the royalty rate, we have agreed to submit the matter to arbitration.
 
Under the agreement, we have the right to revoke both the manufacturing license and the sale license to be granted to Medinet or the sale license only. If we exercise this right, we will be obligated to make a one-time payment to Medinet calculated based on the nonroyalty payments made to us by Medinet under the agreement, repay the outstanding amount due under the loan and assume certain obligations of Medinet, and Medinet will be obligated to assist us in transitioning the relevant rights in Japan to us or a party that we designate. If we exercise our revocation right with respect to the sale license only, the one-time payment will equal the total amount of nonroyalty payments. If we exercise our revocation right with respect to the manufacturing license and the sale license, the one-time payment will equal 150% or 200% of the nonroyalty payments depending on the timing of the exercise of the revocation right.

The agreement will terminate upon expiration of the royalty term, upon which all licenses will become fully paid up, perpetual non-exclusive licenses. Either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or if specified conditions occur relating to the other party’s insolvency or bankruptcy, and we may terminate the agreement if Medinet challenges or assists a third party in challenging specified patent rights of ours. If Medinet terminates the agreement upon our material breach or bankruptcy, Medinet is entitled to terminate our licenses to improvements and retain its royalty-bearing licenses from us.
 
Lummy. On April 7, 2015, we and Lummy HK entered into a license agreement pursuant to which we granted to Lummy HK an exclusive license under the Arcelis technology, including patents, know-how and improvements to manufacture, develop and commercialize products for the treatment of cancer in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. Lummy HK also has a right of first negotiation with respect to a license under the Arcelis technology for the treatment of infectious diseases in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. This agreement was subsequently amended in December 2016.
 
Under the terms of the license agreement, the parties will share relevant data, and we will have a right to reference Lummy HK data for purposes of its development programs under the Arcelis technology. In addition, Lummy HK has granted to us an exclusive, royalty-free license under and to any and all Lummy HK improvements to the Arcelis technology conceived or reduced to practice by Lummy HK and Lummy HK data to develop and/or commercialize products outside China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau, an exclusive, royalty-free license under and to any and all INDs and other regulatory approvals and Lummy HK trademarks used for an Arcelis-Based Product to develop and/or commercialize an Arcelis-Based Product outside China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau and a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under any Lummy HK improvements and Lummy HK data to manufacture Arcelis-Based Products anywhere in the world. Lummy HK has the right to reference our data, INDs and other regulatory filings and submissions for the purpose of developing and obtaining regulatory approval of licensed products in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau.
 
Pursuant to the license agreement, Lummy HK will pay us royalties on net sales and up to an aggregate of up to $20.5 million upon the achievement of manufacturing, regulatory and commercial milestones. The license agreement will terminate upon expiration of the last to expire royalty term for all Arcelis-Based Products, with each royalty term being the longer of the expiration of the last valid patent claim covering the applicable Arcelis-Based Product and 10 years from the first commercial sale of such Arcelis-Based Product. Either party may terminate the license agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or if specified conditions occur relating to the other party’s insolvency or bankruptcy. We may terminate the license agreement if Lummy HK challenges or assists a third party in challenging specified patent rights of ours. If Lummy HK terminates the license agreement upon our material breach or bankruptcy, Lummy HK is entitled to terminate the licenses it granted to us and retain its licenses from us with respect to Arcelis-Based Products then in development or being commercialized, subject to Lummy HK’s continued obligation to pay royalties and milestones with respect to such Arcelis-Based Products.
 
Invetech. On October, 29, 2014, we entered into a development agreement with Invetech Pty Ltd, or Invetech. The development agreement supersedes and replaces the development agreement entered into by the parties as of July 20, 2005. Under the development agreement, Invetech agreed to continue to develop and provide prototypes of the automated production system to be used for the manufacture of our Arcelis-based products, or the Production Systems. Development services will be performed on a proposal by proposal basis. Invetech has agreed to defer 30% of its fees, but such deferral may not exceed $5,000,000. We are paying these deferred fees (plus interest of 7% per annum) pursuant to an installment plan (eight installments payable within the first two years after December 31, 2016). We are currently renegotiating the terms of the development agreement related to the deferred fees, and are in discussions with Invetech regarding the repayment of the fees, including the potential conversion of some or all of the outstanding fees into equity of the Company.
 
The development agreement requires the parties to discuss in good faith Invetech’s supply of Production Systems for use in manufacturing commercial product. We have an obligation to purchase $25.0 million worth of Production Systems, components, subsystems and spare parts for commercial use. Once that obligation has been satisfied, we have the right to have a third party supply Production Systems for use in manufacturing commercial product, provided that Invetech has a right of first refusal with respect to any offer by a third party and we may not accept an offer from a third party unless that offer is at a price that is less than that offered by Invetech and otherwise under substantially the same or better terms. We will own all intellectual property arising from the development services (with the exception of existing Invetech intellectual property incorporated therein-under which we will have a license). The term of the development agreement will continue until the completion of the development of the Production Systems. The development agreement can be terminated early by either party because of a technical failure or by us without cause.
 
Saint-Gobain. In January 2015, we entered into a development agreement with Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corporation, or Saint Gobain, that was subsequently amended in December 2015 and 2016. Under the agreement, Saint-Gobain agreed to develop a range of disposables for use in our automated production systems to be used for the manufacture of our Arcelis-based products, which we refer to as the Disposables. We expect total development fees and expenses incurred under the Saint-Gobain Agreement to be approximately $8.6 million, of which $2.1 million has been paid to date and $6.5 million has been accrued as of December 31, 2016. We have also agreed separately to purchase $3.5 million in Disposables under the agreement during 2017. The Saint-Gobain agreement requires the parties to execute a commercial supply agreement under which Saint-Gobain would become the exclusive supplier of Disposables for the manufacture of our products treating solid tumors for no less than fifteen years by March 31, 2017. The Saint-Gobain agreement will continue until December 31, 2017, but can be terminated earlier by written agreement of the parties because of a material default, including the failure to execute the commercial supply agreement, or a failure to achieve a performance milestone. We are currently in discussions with Saint Gobain regarding modification of the terms for the commercial supply agreement and payment of the development fees including a potential conversion of some or all of the outstanding fees into equity of the Company.

Cellscript. In December 2015, we entered into a development and supply agreement with Cellscript, LLC. Under the agreement, Cellscript has agreed to develop cGMP processes for the manufacture and production of CD40L RNA, a ribonucleic acid used in the production of our Arcelis -based products, and to manufacture and produce CD40L RNA.


In consideration for these development and production services, we have agreed to pay Cellscript total fees of $4,600,000. Upon the execution of the agreement, we made an initial payment to Cellscript of $2,000,000 through the issuance to Cellscript of 906,194 shares of our common stock. The balance of these fees are payable to Cellscript, at our option, in cash, common stock or a combination of cash and common stock upon the achievement of development milestones. Any shares of common stock issued pursuant to the agreement are subject to a lock-up period of 180 days from the date of issuance of such shares to Cellscript.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, Cellscript shall be the sole and exclusive manufacturer and supplier to us of CD40L RNA, and we will make agreed upon cash payments to Cellscript for CD40L RNA produced for us during the term of the Agreement. Under the agreement, Cellscript shall also be our sole and exclusive supplier of enzymes and various kits comprising enzymes for transcription, capping and/or polyadenylation of RNA. We will make agreed upon cash payments to Cellscript amounts for each kit that is purchased under the agreement.
 
The agreement will continue until the earlier of (i) December 31, 2017 or (ii) the effective date of a commercial supply agreement negotiated in good faith by the parties, but can be earlier terminated by either party due to a material breach or upon bankruptcy of the other party.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical and biological products such as those we are developing and may market. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Drug and Biological Product Approval Process
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biological products under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
 
The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biological product for each indication; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, or a BLA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
--+-------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.

25
--

Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 

• | Phase 1: The drug or biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The drug or biological product is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: The drug or biological product is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Special Protocol Assessment. The SPA process is designed to facilitate the FDA’s review and approval of drug and biological products by allowing the FDA to evaluate the proposed design and size of Phase 3 clinical trials that are intended to form the primary basis for determining a drug or biological product’s efficacy. Upon specific request by a clinical trial sponsor, the FDA will evaluate the trial protocol and respond to a sponsor’s questions regarding, among other things, primary efficacy endpoints, trial conduct and data analysis, within 45 days of receipt of the request. The FDA ultimately assesses whether the trial protocol design and planned analysis of the trial adequately address objectives in support of a regulatory submission. All agreements and disagreements between the FDA and the sponsor regarding an SPA must be clearly documented in an SPA letter or the minutes of a meeting between the sponsor and the FDA.
 
Even if the FDA agrees to the design, execution and analyses proposed in protocols reviewed under an SPA, the FDA may revoke or alter its agreement under the following circumstances:
 

• | public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a sponsor fails to follow a protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the relevant data, assumptions, or information provided by the sponsor in a request for SPA change are found to be false statements or misstatements or are found to omit relevant facts; or 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDA and the sponsor agree in writing to modify the trial protocol and such modification is intended to improve the study. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marketing Approval. Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, as amended and reauthorized, an NDA, BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA for certain types of new drug or biological products must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
 

26
--

 
The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, amended the FDCA and requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, or other clinical development programs.
 
The FDA also could require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
 
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs and BLAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and effective (described as safe, pure and potent for BLAs) and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug or biological product to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to develop our product candidates and secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products.
 
If the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA or BLA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites are favorable, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA or BLA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biological product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs. The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drug and biological products that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
 
To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious aspect of a serious or life threatening disease or condition and will fill an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors.
 
In addition, the FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs or biological products that provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative exists or a significant improvement compared to marketed products in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease. For products regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, the product must be intended to treat a serious or life- threatening disease or condition. A priority review means that the targeted time for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than ten months. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
 

27
--

 
Under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, a sponsor also can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biological product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biological products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Products designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 
Post-Approval Requirements. Any drug or biological products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug or biologic.
 
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs and biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical and biological products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 
Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products
 
Non-Patent Exclusivity. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, newly- approved biological products may benefit from statutory periods of non-patent data and marketing exclusivity. The PPACA, among other things, permits the FDA to approve biosimilar or interchangeable versions of biological products through an abbreviated approval pathway following periods of data and marketing exclusivity. Biological products that are considered to be “reference products” are granted two overlapping periods of data and marketing exclusivity: a four-year period during which no abbreviated biologics license application, or abbreviated BLA, relying upon the reference product may be submitted to the FDA, and a twelve-year period during which no abbreviated BLA relying upon the reference product may be approved by FDA. For purposes of the PPACA, a reference product is defined as the single biological product licensed under a full BLA against which a biological product is evaluated in an application submitted under an abbreviated BLA.

We believe that our investigational products, if approved via full BLAs, will be considered “reference products” that are entitled to both four-year and twelve-year exclusivity under the PPACA. The FDA, however, has not issued any regulations or final guidance explaining how it will implement the PPACA, including the exclusivity provisions for reference products. Since February 2012, the FDA has issued six draft guidance documents that provide its preliminary thoughts on how to interpret and implement the abbreviated BLA provisions of the PPACA. The FDA has requested public comments on these draft guidance documents, including the proper interpretation of PPACA exclusivity provisions. It is thus possible that the FDA will decide to interpret the PPACA in such a way that our products are not considered to be reference products for purposes of the PPACA or be entitled to any period of data or marketing exclusivity. Even if our products are considered to be reference products and obtain exclusivity under the PPACA, another company nevertheless could also market a competing version of any of our biological products if such company can complete, and the FDA permits the submission of and approves, a full BLA. Although protection under PPACA will not prevent the submission or approval of another “full” BLA, the applicant would be required to conduct its own preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency (i.e., effectiveness).
 
Pediatric Exclusivity. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the four- and 12-year non-patent exclusivity periods described above. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study or studies in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study or studies.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug (including a biologic) intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
 
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA or full BLA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years. For purposes of small molecule drugs, the FDA defines “same drug” as a drug that contains the same active moiety and is intended for the same use as the previously approved orphan drug. For purposes of large molecule drugs, the FDA defines “same drug” as a drug that contains the same principal molecular structural features, but not necessarily all of the same structural features, and is intended for the same use as the drug in question. Notwithstanding the above definitions, a drug that is clinically superior to an orphan drug will not be considered the “same drug” and thus will not be blocked by orphan drug exclusivity.
 
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 
The FDA also administers a clinical research grants program, whereby researchers may compete for funding to conduct clinical trials to support the approval of drugs, biologics, medical devices, and medical foods for rare diseases and conditions. An application for an orphan grant should propose one discrete clinical trial to facilitate FDA approval of the product for a rare disease or condition. The study may address an unapproved new product or an unapproved new use for a product already on the market.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
Although we do not currently market any of our products outside the United States and have no current plans to engage in product commercialization outside the United States, we may decide to do so in the future. In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods, and may be otherwise complicated by some of our products and product candidates being controlled substances. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third party payors, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication.
 
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost- effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third party reimbursement may not be sufficient to enable us to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at an appropriate return on investment. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug product candidates that we are developing and could adversely affect our net revenue and results.
 
Pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
 
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. In particular, the PPACA and a related reconciliation bill, which we collectively refer to as the Affordable Care Act or ACA, contain provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for covered outpatient drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 
New Legislation and Regulations
 
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. For example, the FDASIA and PPACA provisions discussed above were enacted in 2012 and 2010, respectively.
 
Numerous statements made by President Trump and members of the U.S. Congress indicate that it is likely that legislation will be passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump that repeals the PPACA, in whole or in part, and/or introduces a new form of health care reform. It is unclear at this point what the scope of such legislation will be and when it will become effective. Because of the uncertainty surrounding this replacement health care reform legislation, we cannot predict with any certainty the likely impact of the PPACA’s repeal or the adoption of any other health care reform legislation on our business. Whether or not there is alternative health care legislation enacted in the United States, there is likely to be significant disruption to the health care market in the coming months and years.
 
In addition to potential for new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.

Segment and Geographic Information
 
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise engaging in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. We view our operations and manage our business in one operating segment and all of our operations are in North America.
Employees
 
As of January 31, 2017, we had 122 employees, including 24 in research and development, 10 in clinical development, 66 in manufacturing and 22 in general and administrative functions. In March 2017, we announced that our board of directors approved a workforce action plan designed to streamline operations and reduce our operating expenses. Under this plan, we expect to reduce our workforce by 46 employees (or 38%) from 122 employees to 76 employees. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor or trade union. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
