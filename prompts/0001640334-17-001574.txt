ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Background
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 23, 2003, under the name Fashionfreakz International Inc. On December 2, 2005, the Company changed its name to Blink Couture, Inc. Until March 4, 2008, the Company’s principal business was the online retail marketing of trendy clothing and accessories produced by independent designers. On March 4, 2008, the Company discontinued its prior business and changed its business plan. The Company’s business plan now consists of exploring potential targets for a business combination through the purchase of assets, share purchase or exchange, merger or similar type of transaction.
 
The Company is currently considered to be a “blank check” company. The SEC defines those companies as “any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies.” Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their respective jurisdictions. The Company is a “shell company,” defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act as a company with no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations.
 
We will not be restricted in our search for business combination candidates to any particular geographical area, industry or industry segment, and may enter into a combination with a private business engaged in any line of business, including service, finance, mining, manufacturing, real estate, oil and gas, distribution, transportation, medical, communications, high technology, biotechnology or any other. Management’s discretion is, as a practical matter, unlimited in the selection of a combination candidate. Management will seek combination candidates in the United States and other countries, as available time and resources permit, through existing associations and by word of mouth. This plan of operation has been adopted in order to attempt to create value for our stockholders.
 
On June 30, 2016, Blink Couture, Inc., (the “Registrant”), a Delaware corporation entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which the Company merged with its wholly owned subsidiary, Toga Limited, a Delaware corporation with no material operations ("Merger Sub" and such merger transaction, the "Merger"). Upon the consummation of the Merger, the separate existence of Merger Sub ceased and shareholders of the Company became shareholders of the surviving company named “Toga Limited”.
 
As permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law Title 8, Section 251(f), the sole purpose of the Merger was to effect a change of the Company's name from Blink Couture, Inc., to Toga Limited. Upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of Delaware on July 22, 2016 to effect the Merger, the Company's Articles of Incorporation were deemed amended to reflect the change in the Company's corporate name.
 
The name change to Toga Limited became effective in the market on December 16, 2016, following approval by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA), and in conjunction with the name change, the trading symbol for the Company’s common stock was changed. Its shares are now listed for quotation on OTC Markets under the symbol “TOGL.”

Change in Control Transaction
 

On December 10, 2014, A. Terry Ray purchased 277,383 shares of the Company’s common stock from Cynthia Field and Charles Stephenson via a private transaction for $50,000. The transaction represented 70.6% of the Company’s outstanding shares, resulting in a change in control of the Company’s common stock.
 
On January 3, 2015, A. Terry Ray was appointed Director of the Corporation, Lawrence D. Field resigned as President of the Corporation, and A. Terry Ray was appointed Director of the Corporation.
         On June 13, 2016, Michael Toh Kok Soon purchased a total of 277,383 shares of the issued and outstanding common stock from A. Terry Ray pursuant to the terms of an Agreement for the Purchase of Common Stock dated May 31, 2016 for $230,000. The shares represent approximately 70.55% of the Company’s outstanding shares, resulting in a change in control of the Company.     On June 13, 2016, A. Terry Ray resigned from her positions as President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and sole director. Immediately prior to her resignation as a director, on June 13, 2016, A. Terry Ray appointed Michael Toh Kok Soon as a director, President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary.       
Business Plan


The Company’s business plan is to seek, investigate, and, if warranted, acquire one or more properties or businesses, and to pursue other related activities intended to enhance shareholder value. The acquisition of a business opportunity may be made by purchase, merger, exchange of stock, or otherwise, and may encompass assets or a business entity, such as a corporation, joint venture, or partnership. The Company has limited capital, and it is unlikely that the Company will be able to take advantage of more than one such business opportunity. The Company intends to seek opportunities demonstrating the potential of long-term growth as opposed to short-term earnings.
 
We will be competing against other entities that possess greater financial, technical and managerial capabilities for identifying and completing business combinations. In evaluating a prospective business combination, we will conduct a reasonable due diligence review of potential targets given the lack of information which may be available regarding private companies, our limited personnel and financial resources, and the limited experience of our management with respect to such activities. We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with the target business’s incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage. Our limited funds and the lack of full-time management will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business combination. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. Our decision-making will be particularly dependent upon information provided by the promoters, owners, sponsors or others associated with the target business seeking our participation.

Additionally, the Company is in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including small public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce our likelihood of identifying and consummating a successful business combination.
 
Any business opportunity that is acquired by the Company is expected to have a desire to become a public company and establish a public trading market for its securities. As such, in connection with such business combination, it is likely that control of the Company would be transferred from the current principal shareholders of the Company to the acquiring entity or its affiliates.
 
We anticipate that business opportunities will come to the Company’s attention from various sources. These sources may include, but not be limited to, its principal shareholders, professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants, securities broker-dealers, and others who may present unsolicited proposals.
 
It is possible that the range of business opportunities that might be available for consideration by the Company could be limited by the impact of Securities and Exchange Commission regulations regarding purchase and sale of “penny stocks.” The regulations would affect, and possibly impair, any market that might develop in the Company’s securities until such time as they qualify for listing on NASDAQ or on another exchange which would make them exempt from applicability of the “penny stock” regulations.
 
The Company believes that various types of potential merger or acquisition candidates might find a business combination with the Company to be attractive. These include acquisition candidates desiring to create a public market for their shares in order to enhance liquidity for current shareholders, acquisition candidates which have long-term plans for raising capital through the public sale of securities and believe that the possible prior existence of a public market for their securities would be beneficial, and acquisition candidates which plan to acquire additional assets through issuance of securities rather than for cash, and believe that the possibility of development of a public market for their securities will be of assistance in that process. Acquisition candidates who have a need for an immediate cash infusion are not likely to find a potential business combination with the Company to be an attractive alternative.
 
The Company’s focus is on small and medium-sized enterprises which have a desire to become public companies and which are able to satisfy, or anticipate in the reasonably near future being able to satisfy, the minimum asset and other requirements in order to qualify shares for trading on a senior stock exchange such as the Nasdaq Market or the NYSE MKT (See “Investigation and Selection of Business Opportunities”). The Company anticipates that potential acquisition candidates may (i) be recently organized with no operating history, or a history of losses attributable to under-capitalization or other factors; (ii) be experiencing financial or operating difficulties; (iii) be in need of funds to develop a new product or service or to expand into a new market; (iv) be relying upon an untested product or marketing concept; or (v) have a combination of the characteristics mentioned in (i) through (iv). The Company intends to concentrate its acquisition efforts on properties or businesses that it believes to be undervalued. Given the above factors, investors should expect that any acquisition candidate may have a history of losses or low profitability.
 
The Company does not propose to restrict its search for investment opportunities to any particular geographical area or industry, and may, therefore, engage in essentially any business, to the extent of its limited resources. This includes industries such as service, finance, natural resources, manufacturing, high technology, product development, medical, communications and others. The Company’s discretion in the selection of business opportunities is unrestricted, subject to the availability of such opportunities, economic conditions, and other factors.
 
The Company does not currently intend to enter into a merger or acquisition transaction with any business with which any of the Company’s officers, directors or principal shareholders are affiliated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should the Company determine, in the future, that a transaction with an affiliated company would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, the Company is, in general, permitted by Delaware law to enter into such a transaction if:
 


1. | The material facts as to the relationship or interest of the affiliate and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors, and the Board in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors constitute less than a quorum; or
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | The material facts as to the relationship or interest of the affiliate and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or 
3. | The contract or transaction is fair as to the Company as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the Board of Directors or the stockholders.

Investigation and Selection of Business Opportunities
 
To a large extent, a decision to participate in a specific business opportunity may be made upon the principal shareholders’ analysis of the quality of the other company’s management and personnel, the anticipated acceptability of new products or marketing concepts, the merit of technological changes, the perceived benefit the Company will derive from becoming a publicly held entity, and numerous other factors which are difficult, if not impossible, to analyze through the application of any objective criteria. In many instances, it is anticipated that the historical operations of a specific business opportunity may not necessarily be indicative of the potential for the future because of the possible need to access capital, shift marketing approaches substantially, expand significantly, change product emphasis, change or substantially augment management, or make other changes. The Company will be dependent upon the owners of a potential acquisition candidate to identify any such problems which may exist and to implement, or be primarily responsible for the implementation of, required changes. Because the Company may participate in a business opportunity with a newly organized firm or with a firm which is entering a new phase of growth, it is possible that the Company could incur further risks, because management in many instances will not have proved its abilities or effectiveness, the eventual market for such company’s products or services will likely not be established, and such company may not be profitable when acquired.
 
It is anticipated that the Company will not be able to diversify, but will essentially be limited to one such venture because of the Company’s limited financial resources. This lack of diversification will not permit the Company to offset potential losses from one business opportunity against profits from another.
 
The Company may consummate transactions having a potentially adverse impact upon the Company’s shareholders pursuant to the authority and discretion of the Company’s management and board of directors to complete acquisitions without submitting any proposal to the stockholders for their consideration. Holders of the Company’s securities should not anticipate that the Company will necessarily furnish such holders, prior to any merger or acquisition, with financial statements, or any other documentation, concerning a target company or its business. In some instances, however, the proposed participation in a business opportunity may be submitted to the stockholders for their consideration, either voluntarily by such directors to seek the stockholders’ advice and consent or because state law so requires.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our management and the Company’s principal shareholders. Current or future management of the Company may decide to hire outside consultants to assist in the investigation and selection of business opportunities, and might pay a finder’s fee, in stock in cash, as allowed by law. Since the Company has no current plans to use any outside consultants, no criteria or policies have been adopted. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in finding or acquiring a desirable business opportunity, given that limited funds are available for acquisitions, or that any acquisition that occurs will be on terms that are favorable to the Company or its stockholders.
 
The Company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in other potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, the Company will consider the following kinds of factors:
 


· | Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; 
· | Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; 
· | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;
· | The cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials; 
· | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; 
· | The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and 
· | Other relevant factors.

In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to the Company’s limited capital available for investigation, the Company may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired.
 
Prior to making a decision to participate in a business opportunity, the Company will generally request that it be provided with written materials regarding the business opportunity containing such items as a description of products, services and company history; management resumes; financial information; available projections, with related assumptions upon which they are based; an explanation of proprietary products and services; evidence of existing patents, trademarks, or services marks, or rights thereto; present and proposed forms of compensation to management; a description of transactions between such company and its affiliates during relevant periods; a description of present and required facilities; an analysis of risks and competitive conditions; a financial plan of operation and estimated capital requirements; audited financial statements, or if they are not available, unaudited financial statements, together with reasonable assurances that audited financial statements would be able to be produced within a reasonable period of time following completion of a merger transaction; and other information deemed relevant.
 
As part of the Company’s investigation, the Company’s principal shareholders may meet personally with management and key personnel of a potential acquisition candidate, visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis or verification of certain information provided, check references of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of the Company’s limited financial resources.
 
Form of Acquisition
 
It is not possible to predict the manner in which the Company may participate in another business opportunity with any degree of certainty. Specific business opportunities will be reviewed as well as the respective needs and desires of the Company and the promoters of the opportunity and, upon the basis of that review and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such promoters, the legal structure or method deemed by management to be suitable will be selected. Such structure may include, but is not limited to leases, purchase and sale agreements, licenses, joint ventures and other contractual arrangements. The Company may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership, corporation or other form of organization. Implementing such structure may require the merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Company with other corporations or forms of business organization, and although it is likely, there is no assurance that the Company would be the surviving entity. In addition, the present management, board of directors and stockholders of the Company most likely will not have control of a majority of the voting shares of the Company following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, the Company’s existing management and directors may resign and new management and directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders.
 
It is likely that the Company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of common stock or other securities of the Company. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called “tax free” reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, depends upon the issuance to the stockholders of the acquired company of a controlling interest (i.e. 80% or more) of the common stock of the combined entities immediately following the reorganization. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other “tax free” provisions provided under the Internal Revenue Code, the Company’s current stockholders would retain in the aggregate 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares. This could result in substantial additional dilution in the equity of those who were stockholders of the Company prior to such reorganization. Any such issuance of additional shares might also be done simultaneously with a sale or transfer of shares representing a controlling interest in the Company by the principal shareholders.
 
It is anticipated that any new securities issued in any reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemptions, if any are available, from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of the transaction, the Company may agree to register such securities either at the time the transaction is consummated, or under certain conditions or at specified times thereafter. The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market that might develop in the Company’s securities may have a depressive effect upon such market.

The Company will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of a written agreement. Although the terms of such agreement cannot be predicted, generally such an agreement would require specific representations and warranties by all of the parties thereto, specify certain events of default, detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties thereto prior to such closing, outline the manner of bearing costs if the transaction is not closed, set forth remedies upon default, and include miscellaneous other terms normally found in an agreement of that type.
 
It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in any other specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred might not be recoverable. Moreover, because many providers of goods and services require compensation at the time or soon after the goods and services are provided, the inability of the Company to pay until an indeterminate future time may make it impossible to procure such goods and services.
 
In all probability, upon completion of an acquisition or merger, there will be a change in control through issuance of substantially more shares of common stock. Further, in conjunction with an acquisition or merger, it is likely that the principal shareholders may offer to sell a controlling interest at a price not relative to or reflective of a price which could be achieved by individual shareholders at the time.
 
Investment Company Act and Other Regulation
 
The Company may participate in a business opportunity by purchasing, trading or selling the securities of such business. The Company does not, however, intend to engage primarily in such activities. Specifically, the Company intends to conduct its activities so as to avoid being classified as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Act”), and therefore to avoid application of the costly and restrictive registration and other provisions of the Investment Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
 
Section 3(a) of the Investment Act contains the definition of an “investment company,” and it excludes any entity that does not engage primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, or that does not engage in the business of investing, owning, holding or trading “investment securities” (defined as “all securities other than government securities or securities of majority-owned subsidiaries”) the value of which exceeds 40% of the value of its total assets (excluding government securities, cash or cash items). The Company intends to implement its business plan in a manner which will result in the availability of this exception from the definition of “investment company.” Consequently, the Company’s participation in a business or opportunity through the purchase and sale of investment securities will be limited.
 
The Company’s plan of business may involve changes in its capital structure, management, control and business, especially if it consummates a reorganization as discussed above. Each of these areas is regulated by the Investment Act, in order to protect purchasers of investment company securities. Since the Company will not register as an investment company, stockholders will not be afforded these protections.
 
Any securities which the Company might acquire in exchange for its Common Stock are expected to be “restricted securities” within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”). If the Company elects to resell such securities, such sale cannot proceed unless a registration statement has been declared effective by the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission or an exemption from registration is available. Although the plan of operation does not contemplate resale of securities acquired, if such a sale were to be necessary, the Company would be required to comply with the provisions of the Act to effect such resale.
 
An acquisition made by the Company may be in an industry which is regulated or licensed by federal, state or local authorities. Compliance with such regulations can be expected to be a time-consuming and expensive process.
 
Competition
 
The Company expects to encounter substantial competition in its efforts to locate attractive opportunities, primarily from business development companies, venture capital partnerships and corporations, venture capital affiliates of large industrial and financial companies, small investment companies, and wealthy individuals. Many of these entities will have significantly greater experience, resources and managerial capabilities than the Company and will therefore be in a better position than the Company to obtain access to attractive business opportunities.

Employees
 
We presently have no employees apart from our management. Our officers and directors are engaged in outside business activities and anticipate that they will devote to our business very limited time until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination.
