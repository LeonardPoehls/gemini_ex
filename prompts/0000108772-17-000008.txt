ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Separation
On December 31, 2016, Xerox Corporation completed the separation of its Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) business from its Document Technology and Document Outsourcing (DT/DO) business (the “Separation”). The Separation was accomplished by moving the BPO business into a new legal entity, Conduent Incorporated (“Conduent”), and then distributing one hundred percent (100%) of the outstanding common stock of Conduent to Xerox Corporation stockholders (the “Distribution”). Conduent is now an independent public company listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “CNDT”. 
As a result of the Separation and Distribution, the BPO business is presented as a discontinued operation and, as such, has been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.
In connection with the Separation, Xerox entered into several agreements with Conduent to (1) effect the legal and structural separation of Xerox and Conduent, (2) govern the relationship between Xerox and Conduent up to and after the completion of the Separation and (3) allocate between Xerox and Conduent various assets, liabilities and obligations, including, among other things, employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities. The agreements included a separation and distribution agreement, a transition service agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, an intellectual property agreement and a trademark license agreement. The transition services primarily involve Xerox providing services to Conduent related to information technology and human resource infrastructure and are all expected to be for terms of no more than one year post-separation.
Our Business
Xerox is innovating the way the world communicates, connects and works. We apply our expertise in imaging and printing, data analytics, and the development of secure and automated solutions to help our customers improve productivity, maximize profitability and increase client satisfaction.
We are a leading global provider of digital print technology and related solutions; we operate in a market estimated at approximately $85 billion(1). Our primary offerings span three main areas: Managed Document Services (which largely represents the Document Outsourcing business that was reported in our Services segment before the separation), Workplace Solutions and Graphic Communications. Our Managed Document Services offerings help customers, ranging from small businesses to global enterprises, optimize their printing and related document workflow and business processes. Xerox led the establishment of this expanding market and continues as the industry leader. Our Workplace Solutions and Graphic Communications products and solutions support the work processes of our customers by providing them with an efficient, cost effective printing and communications infrastructure.
(1) Market estimates are derived from third-party forecasts produced by firms such as International Data Corporation (IDC).
Our Strategy and Business Model 
Our strategy is to apply innovation in digital print technology and services in order to increase our participation in the growth areas of our market while maintaining leadership in the more mature areas. Our Strategic Transformation program (see: Accelerate Productivity and Cost Initiatives through Strategic Transformation section below) is intended to provide the required investments to improve our revenue trajectory while expanding our margins. Our profitable annuity-based business model enables us to deliver strong, sustainable cash flows. We believe the combination of an improving revenue trajectory along with expanding operating margins and strong cash flow will enable us to deliver strong shareholder returns over time. To accomplish this, we focus on the following areas:
Maintain Market Leadership and Focus on Strategic Growth Areas
We are a leader in our industry and have a strong and valuable brand that continues to be ranked in the top percentile of the most valuable global brands. We systematically evaluate the markets, competition, and the needs of our customers and partners; we are focused on maintaining our position in areas where we are the leader, and making the portfolio and distribution investments to further penetrate growth areas of the market.
Xerox 2016 Annual Report 1

We will make investments and execute our strategies using the following approach:

• | Expand leadership in Managed Document Services by leveraging and extending our strength in large enterprises and broadening our SMB (small to mid-sized business) offerings.


• | Increase SMB coverage through resellers and partners (including multi-brand dealers) and continued distribution acquisitions.


• | Gain share in the A4 product segment of the market, where historically we have been under-represented, by strengthening our product portfolio and increasing distribution capacity.


• | Extend leadership in digital color production through continued innovation and growth in new markets.

Geographically, our footprint spans more than 160 countries and allows us to deliver superior technology and solutions to customers of all sizes, regardless of complexity or number of customer locations.
Innovate to Differentiate Our Offerings
Differentiating our offerings is key to our strategy. A critical role of our research is to envision the future and identify new competency areas for that future. We direct our research and development (R&D) investments to areas such as workflow automation, color printing and customized communication, as well as improving the quality and reducing the environmental impact of digital printing. We are investing in new and novel applications of printing technology that could offer attractive opportunities in adjacent markets. We expect this will deliver incremental value for our customers and drive profitable revenue growth for our business.
Accelerate Productivity and Cost Initiatives through Strategic Transformation
We have a track record of operational excellence and maintaining strong margins through ongoing cost and productivity initiatives. As markets shift, we undertake restructuring to optimize our workforce and facilities to best align our resources with the growth areas of our business, and to maximize profitability and cash flow in businesses that are declining. In 2016, we initiated a three-year Strategic Transformation program to simplify and create a significantly more effective structure that delivers productivity and cost reduction beyond our historical range of $300 to $350 million of annual savings. The program is expected to deliver gross productivity gains and cost savings of at least $1.5 billion over the three- year period. It targets to gain efficiencies in areas such as delivery, remote connectivity, sales productivity, pricing, design efficiency and supply chain optimization. It will improve our competitiveness and enable us to deliver margin expansion while reinvesting in the business to improve the revenue trajectory.
Engage, Develop and Support Our People
Our offerings are supported by a talented global workforce focused on delivering value to our customers. We continue to develop our employees by investing in processes and systems, equipping them with modern tools that enable them to perform their jobs more effectively and providing opportunities for career growth.
Annuity-Based Business Model and Shareholder-Centered Capital Allocation 
Our business is based on an annuity model that provides significant recurring revenue and cash generation. In 2016, approximately 75 percent of our total revenue was annuity-based; this includes contracted services, equipment maintenance, consumable supplies and financing, among other elements. The remaining 25 percent of our revenue comes from equipment sales, either from lease agreements that qualify as sales for accounting purposes or outright cash sales.
We remain committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating profile while also using our strong cash flow to deliver shareholder returns through a balanced capital allocation strategy. We selectively pursue acquisitions in targeted growth areas to improve portfolio mix and drive profit expansion. Our objective is to deliver over 50% of free cash flow back to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases over time.
Acquisitions and Divestitures 
In 2016, as we prepared to spin-off Conduent, we allocated only a modest portion of free cash flow to acquisitions. Consistent with our strategy to expand distribution in under-penetrated markets, we added two equipment dealers to our Global Imaging Systems network. We did not have any divestitures during the year.
Additional details can be found in Note 3 - Acquisitions and Note 4 - Divestitures, in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Innovation and Research
Xerox has a rich heritage of innovation, and innovation continues to be a core strength of the company as well as a competitive differentiator. Our aim is to create value for our customers, our shareholders and our people by driving innovation in key areas. Our investments in innovation align with our growth opportunities in areas like workflow automation, color printing, customized communication and new and novel applications of printing technology. 
Our research efforts can be categorized under four themes:

1. | Digital Printing - Improve the cost and capability of digital printing for documents and beyond

Advances in digital printing are enabling mass customization at a run cost approaching the cost of analog printing. We are continuously investing in research to reduce the cost of digital printing consumables while maintaining the high print quality that our customers expect. Our research is also focused on developing new printing technologies that enable us to print digitally on a broader range of media and substrates such as foils, cartons, and directly on end-use products, which will open up new growth markets such as digital packaging. Printing with functional inks will also allow us to add intelligence to packaging, such as sensors, memory, and interactive features, which will enable new analytic-based services, higher security and new consumer experiences. As a responsible corporate citizen, we are also investing in research to lower the environmental impact of our products and consumables.

2. | Personalization at Scale - Enhance value by providing secure, real-time, context-aware personalized products, solutions and services

Whether business correspondence, personal communication, manufactured items or an information service, personalization increases the value of communication. Our research leads to technologies that improve the efficiency, economics, relevance and security of our customers' products and services. We help customers improve the impact of their communications by leveraging vast information resources available from private databases or public sources including social media and delivering personalized messages, products and services. Examples of innovation focus areas include creating new capabilities in imaging, multi-media marketing campaign management, workflow automation and augmented reality to deliver personalization at scale.

3. | Agile Enterprise - Create simple, automated and touch-less business workflows resulting in lower cost, higher quality and increased agility

Enterprises of all sizes require agility in order to quickly respond to market changes and new requirements. To enable greater business process agility, our research goals are to simplify, automate and enable business processes on the cloud via flexible platforms that run on robust and scalable infrastructures. We continue to invest in new capabilities to help people better leverage and integrate paper and digital workflows. And we go beyond that to develop innovations for the automation of business workflows. These leverage our research in image, video and natural language processing, as well as machine learning. Application of these methods to business workflows enables technology to perform tasks that today are performed manually, thus allowing workers to focus on higher value tasks.

4. | Usable Analytics - Transform big data into useful information resulting in better business decisions

Competitive advantage can be achieved by better utilizing available and real-time information. Today, information resides in an ever-increasing universe of servers, repositories and formats. The vast majority of information is unstructured, including text, images, voice and videos. One key research area is making sense of unstructured information using natural language processing and semantic analysis. A second major research area focuses on developing proprietary methods for prescriptive analytics applied to business processes. Here, we seek to better manage very large data systems in order to extract business insights and use those insights to provide our clients with actionable recommendations. Tailoring these methods to various vertical applications leads to new customer value propositions.
Our innovation goals are supported by cross disciplinary research programs in our different research centers. PARC, the most prominent of these centers, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xerox located in Silicon Valley. It provides Xerox commercial and government clients with R&D and open innovation services. PARC scientists have deep technological expertise in areas that we consider fundamental to bring high-impact innovations to our customers and the world; such areas include big data analytics, intelligent sensing, computer vision, networking, printed electronics, energy, and digital design and manufacturing.
Xerox 2016 Annual Report 3

Investment in R&D is critical for competitiveness in our fast-paced markets. One of the ways that we maintain our market leadership is through strategic coordination of our R&D with Fuji Xerox (an equity investment in which we maintain a 25 percent ownership interest).
Our total research, development and engineering expenses (RD&E), which includes sustaining engineering expenses for hardware engineering and software development after we launch a product, totaled $476 million in 2016, $511 million in 2015 and $531 million in 2014. Fuji Xerox R&D expenses were $628 million in 2016, $569 million in 2015 and $654 million in 2014.
Segment Information
During 2016 our primary reportable segments were Services and Document Technology. The segment financial information for 2016 is provided in Note 2 - Segment Reporting in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which we incorporate by reference here. The Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) business is not reported in our segment financial information as it is now classified as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, the Services reportable segment reflects only the financial information for our legacy Document Outsourcing services business and certain other services businesses that were transferred from the BPO business to Xerox prior to the separation.
Following the separation of the BPO business, we are realigning our business to better manage and serve our customers and the markets in which we operate. As a result, in 2017, we expect to shift to a geographic structure and be primarily organized on the basis of two main business units: North America Operations (U.S. and Canada) and International Operations (Europe, Eurasia, Latin America, Middle East, Africa and India). Although we are still evaluating our segment reporting for 2017, our current expectation is that we will report as one reportable segment. We operate in more than 160 countries worldwide through these two primary business units. 
Accordingly, the section below primarily discusses the business based on the offerings (Managed Document Services, Workplace Solutions and Graphic Communications) that are brought to market through these two primary geographic business units. 
Revenues
We have a broad and diverse base of customers by both geography and industry, ranging from SMBs to graphic communications companies, governmental entities, educational institutions and Fortune 1000 corporations. Our business does not depend upon a single customer, or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business spans three main offering areas: Managed Document Services, Workplace Solutions and Graphic Communications. In addition, a smaller portion of our revenues comes from non-core streams including paper sales in our developing market countries, wide-format systems, licensing revenue and Global Imaging Systems network integration solutions. 
Our Managed Document Services includes a continuum of solutions and services spanning from managing print to automating processes to managing content. This area includes the Document Outsourcing business, as well as a set of communication and marketing solutions offers that were previously part of BPO, both of which were reported in our Services segment before the separation. Our primary offerings within Managed Document Services are Managed Print Services (MPS), including Workflow Automation Services, and Communication and Marketing Solutions (CMS). 

• | In our MPS business, we help companies assess and optimize their print infrastructure, secure and integrate their environment and automate and simplify their business processes. We provide the most comprehensive portfolio of MPS services in the industry and are recognized as an industry leader by major analyst firms including Gartner, IDC, Quocirca, InfoTrends and Forrester. As the market leader in MPS, we help clients reduce costs, increase productivity and meet their environmental sustainability goals while supporting their mobile and security needs.


◦ | Our MPS offering targets clients ranging from large, global enterprises, to governmental entities and to small and medium-sized businesses, including those served via our channel partners.


◦ | Our Next Generation Xerox Partner Print Services is a comprehensive suite of services that allows channel partners to support their SMB customers with some of the same best-in-class tools, processes, and workflow solutions developed by Xerox for large enterprises.

Xerox 2016 Annual Report 4


◦ | Our Xerox Workflow Automation Services help our customers assess, optimize and automate their workflow in a secure and integrated IT environment. By eliminating ineffective processes, we bring our clients operational excellence in routine workflows as well as industry-specific processes.


• | In our CMS business, we help large enterprise and global clients drive effective multi-channel customer communications across different digital and physical touch points. CMS offers a full range of managed services that deliver relevant and timely communications focused on customer acquisition, onboarding or retention. Our portfolio includes Document Publishing Services and Transactional Print Services, which continue to serve our existing and well established print and publishing clients. It also includes an expanded suite of service offerings focused on our new on-line digital services including Collateral Management Services, Demand Generation Services, Inbound and Outbound Digital Services, Product Information Management Services and multi-channel Communication Services.

Our Workplace Solutions area is made up of two strategic product groups, Entry and Mid-Range, which share common technology, manufacturing and product platforms. Workplace Solutions revenues include the sale of products and supplies, as well as the associated technical service and financing of those products.

• | Entry comprises desktop monochrome and color printers and multifunction printers (MFPs) ranging from small personal devices to workgroup printers and multifunction printers that serve the needs of office workgroups. Entry products are sold to customers in all segments from SMB to enterprise, principally through a global network of reseller partners and service providers, as well as through our direct sales force.


• | Mid-Range comprises products for enterprises of all sizes. These products are sold through dedicated partners, our direct sales force, multi-branded channel partners and resellers worldwide. We are a leader in this area of the market and offer a wide range of multifunction printers, copiers, digital printing presses and light production devices, and solutions that deliver flexibility and advanced features.

Our Graphic Communications Solutions are designed for customers in the graphic communications, in-plant and production print environments with high-volume printing requirements. These solutions enable full-color, on-demand printing of a wide range of applications, including variable data for personalized content and one-to-one marketing. Graphic Communications Solutions revenues includes the sale of products, software and supplies, as well as the associated technical service and financing of those products. 

• | Our cut-sheet presses provide graphic communications and commercial printers with high speed, high-volume printing. They are ideal for publishing, transaction printing, print on demand and one-to-one marketing, offering the best in high speed, productivity and resolution and color. We are the worldwide leader in the cut-sheet color and monochrome production industry.


• | Our inkjet presses offer a broad range of roll fed, continuous feed printing technologies, including waterless inkjet and aqueous inkjet for vivid color, and toner-based flash fusing for black and white. Our portfolio spans a variety of print speeds, image quality, feeding, finishing and media options. We continue to develop and integrate our production inkjet business to bring the high-end capabilities of toner-based presses such as speed and inline color correction to the more price sensitive market of inkjet. 


• | Our FreeFlow portfolio of software offerings brings intelligent automation and integration to the processing of print jobs, from file preparation to final production, for a touchless workflow. It helps customers of all sizes address a wide range of business opportunities including automation, personalization and even electronic publishing.

Geographic Information 
Our global presence is one of our core strengths. Overall, approximately 40 percent of our revenue is generated by customers outside the U.S.
In 2016, our revenues by geography were as follows: U.S. - $6,403 million (59 percent of total revenue), Europe - $2,861 million (27 percent of total revenue), and Other areas - $1,507million (14 percent of total revenue). Revenues by geography are based on the location of the unit reporting the revenue and include export sales.

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 
Prior to the separation, Xerox and its subsidiaries were awarded 766 U.S. utility patents in 2016. Including our research partner Fuji Xerox, we were awarded 1,352 U.S. utility patents in 2016. Our patent portfolio evolves as new patents are awarded to us and as older patents expire. As of December 31, 2016, we held about 12,235 U.S. design and utility patents. These patents expire at various dates up to 20 years or more from their original filing dates. While we believe that our portfolio of patents and applications has value, in general no single patent is essential to our business or any individual segment. In addition, any of our proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or may not provide significant competitive advantages.
Upon separation, 296 U.S. patents were transferred to the patent portfolio of Conduent and its subsidiaries. Of those patents, 82 were utility patents issued in 2016. Xerox retains approximately 11,940 utility and design patents in its portfolio, including 684 utility patents issued in 2016.
In the U.S., we are party to numerous patent-licensing agreements and, in a majority of them, we license or assign our patents to others in return for revenue and/or access to their patents. Most patent licenses expire concurrently with the expiration of the last patent identified in the license. We are also a party to a number of cross-licensing agreements with companies that hold substantial patent portfolios, including Conduent. These agreements vary in subject matter, scope, compensation, significance and time.
In the U.S., prior to the separation, we owned more than 396 U.S. trademarks, either registered or applied for. These trademarks have a perpetual life, subject to renewal every 10 years. We vigorously enforce and protect our trademarks. Upon separation, 165 trademarks were transferred to Conduent, while Xerox retains 231 trademarks.
Marketing and Distribution
We go to market with a services-led approach and sell our products and services directly to customers through our world-wide sales force and through a network of independent agents, dealers, value-added resellers, systems integrators and the Web. In addition, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Global Imaging Systems (GIS), an office technology dealer comprised of regional core companies in the U.S., sells document management and network integration systems and services. We continued to expand our distribution to small and medium-size businesses in 2016 through GIS's acquisition of two equipment and document services dealer companies.
In Europe, Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia, we distribute our products through Xerox Limited, a company established under the laws of England, as well as through related non-U.S. companies. Xerox Limited enters into distribution agreements with unaffiliated third parties to distribute our products in many of the countries located in these regions, and previously entered into agreements with unaffiliated third parties who distribute our products in Sudan. Sudan, among others, has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. Department of State and is subject to U.S. economic sanctions. We maintain an export and sanctions compliance program, and believe that we have been, and are in compliance with, U.S. laws and government regulations for Sudan. We have no assets, liabilities or operations in Sudan other than liabilities under the distribution agreements. After observing required prior notice periods, Xerox Limited terminated its distribution agreements with distributors servicing Sudan in August 2006. Now, Xerox has only legacy obligations to third parties, such as providing spare parts and supplies to these third parties. In 2016, total Xerox revenues of $10.8 billion included less than $14 thousand attributable to Sudan. 
Competition
Although we encounter competition in all areas of our business, we are the leader - or among the leaders - in each of our main offering areas. We compete on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support.
Our larger competitors include Canon, Hewlett-Packard Inc., Konica Minolta and Ricoh. Our brand recognition, reputation for document management expertise, innovative technology and service delivery excellence are our competitive advantages. These advantages, combined with our breadth of product offerings, global distribution channels and customer relationships, position us as a strong competitor going forward.
Global Employment 
We had approximately 37,600 employees worldwide as of December 31, 2016.
Xerox 2016 Annual Report 6

Customer Financing 
We finance a large portion of our direct channel customer purchases of Xerox equipment through bundled lease agreements. Financing facilitates customer acquisition of Xerox technology and enhances our value proposition, while providing Xerox an attractive gross margin and a reasonable return on our investment in this business. Additionally, because we primarily finance our own products and have a long history of providing financing to our customers, we are able to minimize much of the risk normally associated with a finance business.
Because our lease contracts permit customers to pay for equipment over time rather than at the date of installation, we maintain a certain level of debt to support our investment in these lease contracts. We fund our customer financing activity through a combination of cash generated from operations, cash on hand and proceeds from capital market offerings. At December 31, 2016, we had $3.7 billion of finance receivables and $0.5 billion of equipment on operating leases, or Total Finance assets of $4.2 billion. We maintain an assumed 7:1 leverage ratio of debt to equity as compared to our Finance assets, which results in the majority of our $6.3 billion of debt being allocated to our financing business.
Refer to "Debt and Customer Financing Activities" in the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of Management's Discussion and Analysis included in Item 7 of this 2016 Form 10-K, which is incorporated here by reference, for additional information.
Manufacturing and Supply 
Our manufacturing and distribution facilities are located around the world. Our largest manufacturing site is in Webster, N.Y., where we produce the Xerox iGen, Nuvera, Brenva and Direct to Object Inkjet Printer systems, components, EA Toner, consumables, fusers and other products. Our other primary manufacturing operations are located in Dundalk, Ireland, for our High-End production products and consumables; Wilsonville, OR, for solid ink consumable supplies and components; and Aubagne, France, for Impika aqueous-ink production ink-jet systems. We also have a facility in Venray, Netherlands, that manufactures certain supplies and provides supply chain management for our international operations.
We have arrangements with Fuji Xerox under which we purchase and sell products, some of which are the result of mutual research and development agreements. Refer to Note 9 - Investments in Affiliates, at Equity in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated here by reference, for additional information regarding our relationship with Fuji Xerox.
We maintain a long-standing relationship of over 15 years with Flextronics, a global electronics manufacturing services company, for our mid-range and entry businesses. Our master supply agreement with Flextronics continues through December 2017 (exclusive of extension rights). We also acquire products from various third parties in order to increase the breadth of our product portfolio and meet channel requirements.
Fuji Xerox 
Fuji Xerox is an unconsolidated entity in which we own a 25 percent interest and FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation (FujiFilm) owns a 75 percent interest. Fuji Xerox develops, manufactures and distributes document processing products in Japan, China, Hong Kong, other areas of the Pacific Rim, Australia and New Zealand. We retain significant rights as a minority shareholder. Our technology licensing agreements with Fuji Xerox ensure that the two companies retain uninterrupted access to each other's portfolio of patents, technology and products. Refer to Note 9 - Investment in Affiliates, at Equity in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated by reference here, for additional information regarding our investment in Fuji Xerox.
International Operations
The financial measures by geographical area for 2016, 2015 and 2014 that are included in Note 2 - Segment Reporting in the Consolidated Financial Statements, are incorporated here by reference. See also the risk factor entitled “Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by conditions abroad, including local economics, political environments, fluctuating foreign currencies and shifting regulatory schemes” in Part I, Item 1A included herein.
Xerox 2016 Annual Report 7

Backlog
Backlog, or the value of unfilled orders, is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects because of the significant proportion of our revenue that follows contract signing and/or equipment installation, the large volume of products we deliver from shelf inventories and the shortening of product life cycles.
Seasonality
Our revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products, the length of sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases and printing volumes. These factors have historically resulted in lower revenues, operating profits and operating cash flows in the first quarter and the third quarter.
