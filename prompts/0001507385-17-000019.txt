Item 1. Business.
Overview 
We are a full-service real estate operating company that operates through two business segments, our real estate investment (“REI”) segment and our investment management segment, Cole Capital, as further discussed in “Note 3 – Segment Reporting” to our consolidated financial statements. Through our REI segment, we own and actively manage a diversified portfolio of 4,142 retail, restaurant, office and industrial real estate properties with an aggregate of 93.3 million square feet, of which 98.3% was leased as of December 31, 2016, with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 9.9 years. Through our Cole Capital segment, we are responsible for raising capital for and managing the affairs of certain non-listed real estate investment trusts (the “Cole REITs”) on a day-to-day basis, identifying and making acquisitions and investments on behalf of the Cole REITs, and recommending to the respective board of directors of each of the Cole REITs an approach for providing investors with liquidity. Cole Capital receives compensation and reimbursement for performing these services. 
Substantially all of the REI segment’s operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership. VEREIT, Inc. is the sole general partner and holder of 97.6% of the common partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (the “OP Units”) as of December 31, 2016 with the remaining 2.4% of the OP Units owned by certain non-affiliated investors and certain former directors, officers and employees of the Former Manager (defined below). Substantially all of the Cole Capital segment’s operations are conducted through Cole Capital Advisors, Inc. (“CCA”), an Arizona corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. CCA is treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) under Section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). Prior to January 8, 2014, we were externally managed by ARC Properties Advisors, LLC (the “Former Manager”) on a day-to-day basis, with the exception of certain acquisition, accounting and portfolio management activities which were performed by our employees. In August 2013, our board of directors (the “Board of Directors” or the “Board”) determined that it was in our best interests to become self-managed, and we completed our transition to self-management on January 8, 2014. Through strategic mergers and acquisitions discussed in “Note 6 – Mergers with Real Estate Businesses” to our consolidated financial statements, the Company has grown significantly since incorporation. 
VEREIT, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Maryland on December 2, 2010 and has elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Operating Partnership was incorporated in the State of Delaware on January 13, 2011. We operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). VEREIT, Inc.’s shares of common stock and 6.70% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series F Preferred Stock”) trade on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the trading symbols “VER” and “VER PRF,” respectively.

Common Stock Continuous Offering Program
On September 19, 2016, the Company registered a continuous equity offering program (the “Program”) pursuant to which the Company can offer and sell, from time to time through September 19, 2019 in “at-the-market” offerings or certain other transactions, shares of common stock with an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750.0 million, through its sales agents. There were no shares of common stock issued under the Program during the year ended December 31, 2016.
Debt Repayments
As a result of the reduction in mortgage debt due to property dispositions and other measures taken by management, the Company decreased total debt by $1.7 billion, from $8.1 billion to $6.4 billion, comprised of unsecured bonds of $0.3 billion, unsecured Credit Facility of $1.0 billion, and secured debt of $0.4 billion. 
Primary Investment Focus
We own and actively manage a diversified portfolio of retail, restaurant, office and industrial real estate assets subject to long-term net leases with creditworthy tenants. Our focus is on single-tenant, net-leased properties that are strategically located and essential to the business operations of the tenant, as well as retail properties that offer necessity and value-oriented products or services. We actively manage the portfolio by considering several metrics including property type, tenant concentration, geography, credit and key economic factors for appropriate balance and diversity. We believe that actively managing our portfolio allows us to attain the best operating results for each asset and the overall portfolio through strategic planning, implementation of these plans and responding proactively to changes and challenges in the marketplace.
Additionally, we employ a shared services model for Cole Capital’s portfolios by providing transactional and operational real estate functions. The shared services model allows our strong and experienced real estate team to be active in the markets at all times and manage complimentary portfolios.
Investment Policies
When evaluating prospective investments in or dispositions of real property, our management considers relevant real estate and financial factors, including the location of the property, the leases and other agreements affecting the property and business operations of the tenant, the creditworthiness of major tenants, its income-producing capacity, its physical condition, its prospects for appreciation, its prospects for liquidity, tax considerations and other factors. In this regard, our management will have substantial discretion with respect to the selection of specific investments, subject in certain instances to the approval of the Board of Directors.
As part of our overall portfolio strategy, we seek to lease space and/or acquire properties leased to creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting and operating guidelines. Prior to entering into any transaction, our corporate credit analysis and underwriting professionals conduct a review of a tenant’s credit quality. In addition, we consistently monitor the credit quality of our portfolio by actively reviewing the creditworthiness of certain tenants, focusing primarily on those tenants representing the greatest concentration of our portfolio. This review primarily includes an analysis of the tenant’s financial statements either quarterly, or as frequently as the lease permits. We also consider tenant credit quality when assessing our portfolio for strategic dispositions. When we assess tenant credit quality, we, among other factors that we may deem relevant: (i) review relevant financial information, including financial ratios, net worth, revenue, cash flows, leverage and liquidity; (ii) evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant’s management team; and (iii) assess the strength/growth of the tenant’s industry. On an on-going basis, we evaluate the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenant’s inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease. The factors considered in determining the credit risk of our tenants include, but are not limited to: payment history; credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric); change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize); tenant financial performance; economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and industry specific credit considerations. We are of the opinion that the credit risk of our portfolio is reduced by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants’ risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants.

The rentable space at these properties was 98.3% leased with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 9.9 years. There were no tenants exceeding 10% of our consolidated annualized rental income as of December 31, 2016 or 2015. As of December 31, 2014, leases with Red Lobster® restaurants represented 11.6% of our consolidated annualized rental income. As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, properties located in Texas represented 13.5%, 13.1% and 12.7%, respectively, of our consolidated annualized rental income. As of December 31, 2016, tenants in the casual dining restaurant and manufacturing industries accounted for 15.6% and 10.1%, respectively, of our consolidated annualized rental income. As of December 31, 2015, tenants in the casual dining restaurant and manufacturing industries accounted for 16.6% and 10.1%, respectively, of our consolidated annualized rental income. As of December 31, 2014, tenants in the casual dining restaurant industry accounted for 18.4% of our consolidated annualized rental income. 
Cole Capital® 
Cole Capital sponsors and manages direct investment real estate programs, which primarily include five publicly registered, non-listed REITs, as discussed in “Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements. Cole Capital is responsible for raising capital for and managing the day-to-day affairs of the Cole REITs, identifying and making acquisitions and investments on behalf of the Cole REITs, and recommending to each of the Cole REIT’s respective board of directors an approach for providing investors with liquidity. Cole Capital serves as the dealer manager and distributes shares of common stock for certain Cole REITs and advises them regarding offerings, manages relationships with participating broker-dealers and financial advisors, and provides assistance in connection with compliance matters relating to the offerings. Cole Capital receives compensation and reimbursement for services relating to the Cole REITs’ offerings and the investment, management, financing and disposition of their respective assets, as applicable. Cole Capital also develops new REIT offerings, including obtaining regulatory approvals from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) and various blue sky jurisdictions for such offerings.
Financing Policies
We rely on leverage to allow us to invest in a greater number of assets and enhance our asset returns. We expect our leverage metrics to improve over time.
We intend to finance future acquisitions with the most advantageous source of capital available to us at the time of the transaction, which may include a combination of public and private offerings of our equity and debt securities, secured and unsecured corporate-level debt, property-level debt and mortgage financing and other public, private or bank debt. In addition, we may acquire properties in exchange for the issuance of common stock or OP Units and in many cases we may acquire properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness. 
We also may obtain secured or unsecured debt to acquire properties, and we expect that our financing sources will include the public debt market, banks and institutional investment firms, including asset managers and life insurance companies. Although we intend to maintain a conservative capital structure, our charter does not contain a specific limitation on the amount of debt we may incur and the Board of Directors may implement or change target debt levels at any time without the approval of our stockholders.
We intend to continue to emphasize unsecured corporate-level or OP-level debt in our financing and to seek to reduce the percentage of our assets which are secured by mortgage loans. For information relating to our Credit Facility, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.” 
Competition 
In our REI segment, we are subject to competition in the acquisition and disposition of properties and in the leasing of our properties. We compete with a number of developers, owners and operators of retail, restaurant, office and industrial real estate, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. We also may face new competitors and, due to our focus on single-tenant properties located throughout the United States, and because many of our competitors are locally or regionally focused, we do not expect to encounter the same competitors in each region of the United States. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than us and may have other advantages over us. Our competitors may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments and may succeed in buying the properties that we have targeted for acquisition. We may also incur costs in connection with unsuccessful acquisitions that we will not be able to recover. Foreign investors may view the U.S. real estate market as being more stable than other international markets and may increase investments in high-quality single-tenant properties, especially in gateway cities.

In our Cole Capital segment, we also face competition in raising funds for the Cole REITs from other entities with similar investment objectives such as other non-listed REITs, publicly traded REITs and private funds, including hedge funds. 
Regulations
Our investments are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, health, safety and zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all material permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments. 
Our properties are also subject to laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”), which require that all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Some of our properties may currently not be in compliance with the ADA. If one or more of the properties in our portfolio is not in compliance with the ADA or any other regulatory requirements, we may be required to incur additional costs to bring the property into compliance.
Environmental Matters 
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, a current owner of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up contaminated property. Under these laws, courts and government agencies have the authority to impose cleanup responsibility and liability even if the owner did not know of and was not responsible for the contamination. For example, liability can be imposed upon us based on the activities of our tenants or a prior owner. In addition to the cost of the cleanup, environmental contamination on a property may adversely affect the value of the property and our ability to sell, rent or finance the property, and may adversely impact our investment in that property. 
Prior to acquisition of a property, we will obtain Phase I environmental reports, or will rely on recent Phase I environmental reports. These reports will be prepared in accordance with an appropriate level of due diligence based on our standards and generally include a physical site inspection, a review of relevant federal, state and local environmental and health agency database records, one or more interviews with appropriate site-related personnel, review of the property’s chain of title and review of historic aerial photographs and other information on past uses of the property and nearby or adjoining properties. We may also obtain a Phase II investigation which may include limited subsurface investigations and tests for substances of concern where the results of the Phase I environmental reports or other information indicates possible contamination or where our consultants recommend such procedures. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 350 employees.
