Item 1.    Business.
Organization
Behringer Harvard Opportunity REIT I, Inc. (which may be referred to as the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated in November 2004 as a Maryland corporation and has elected to be taxed, and currently qualifies, as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for federal income tax purposes.
We operate commercial real estate and real estate-related assets located in and outside the United States and have employed an opportunistic and value-add investment strategy. As of December 31, 2016, we wholly owned two properties and consolidated three properties through investments in joint ventures on our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, we have a noncontrolling, unconsolidated ownership interest in a joint venture consisting of 17 properties as of December 31, 2016, that is accounted for using the equity method. Our investment properties are located in Colorado, Missouri, Texas, and the Commonwealth of The Bahamas; and our equity method investment properties are located in the Czech Republic and Poland.
On August 26, 2016, in connection with an evaluation of strategic alternatives available to us and the possible execution of a liquidity event, our board of directors unanimously approved a plan for the sale of all of our assets and our dissolution pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Liquidation and recommended that the Plan of Liquidation be submitted to our stockholders for approval. On January 30, 2017, our stockholders approved the Plan of Liquidation.
Pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation, we expect to make liquidating distribution payments to our stockholders after we sell all of our assets, pay all of our known liabilities, and provide for unknown liabilities. We expect to complete these activities within 24 months of the adoption of the Plan of Liquidation. We can give no assurances regarding the timing of asset dispositions in connection with the implementation of the Plan of Liquidation, the sales prices we will receive for our assets, or the amount or timing of any liquidating distributions. 
Substantially all of our business is conducted through Behringer Harvard Opportunity OP I, LP, a Texas limited partnership organized in November 2004 (the “Operating Partnership”), or its subsidiaries. Our wholly owned subsidiary, BHO, Inc., a Delaware corporation, owns less than a 0.1% interest in the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner. The remaining interest of the Operating Partnership is held as a limited partnership interest by our wholly owned subsidiary, BHO Business Trust, a Maryland business trust.
Our business has been managed by an external advisor since the commencement of our initial public offering and we have no employees. From September 20, 2005 through February 10, 2017, an affiliate of Behringer acted as our external advisor (the “Behringer Advisor”). On February 10, 2017, we engaged an affiliate of Lightstone, LSG-BH I Advisor LLC (the “Advisor”), to provide advisory services to us. The external advisor is responsible for managing our day-to-day affairs and for services related to implementing the Plan of Liquidation. Affiliates of Behringer have continued to provide services to us during a transition period while the advisory services provided to us by the Behringer Advisor are transferred to the Advisor.
Plan of Liquidation
On January 30, 2017, our stockholders approved the Plan of Liquidation. As a result of approval of the Plan of Liquidation we are authorized, among other things, the following:

• | We are authorized to sell all of our assets, liquidate and dissolve the Company, and distribute the net proceeds from liquidation in accordance with the provisions of our charter and applicable law.


• | We are authorized to take all necessary or advisable actions to wind-up our business, pay our debts and any operating and administrative expenses incurred prior to our dissolution, and distribute the remaining proceeds to our stockholders.


• | We are authorized to provide for the payment of any unascertained or contingent liabilities. We may do so by purchasing insurance, by establishing a reserve fund, or in other ways.


• | We expect to distribute all of the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders within 24 months after January 30, 2017, the date the Plan of Liquidation was approved by our stockholders. However, if we cannot sell our assets and pay our debts within 24 months, or if our board of directors and the special committee determine that it is otherwise advisable to do so, we may transfer and assign our remaining assets to a liquidating trust. Upon any transfer and assignment, our stockholders will receive interests in the liquidating trust. The liquidating trust will pay or provide for all of our liabilities and distribute any remaining net proceeds from liquidation to the holders of interests in the liquidating trust.

• | Once we pay our final distribution and dissolve, all of our outstanding shares of stock will be cancelled and the Company will cease to exist.


• | The board of directors or, if a liquidating trust is established, the trustees of the liquidating trust, may modify, amend or abandon the Plan of Liquidation without action by our stockholders to the extent permitted under applicable law.

Additional information regarding the Plan of Liquidation is included in our definitive proxy statement dated November 10, 2016 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 2, 2016 (the “2016 Proxy Statement”). 
Public Offering of Common Stock; Use of Proceeds
In September 2005, we commenced a public offering (the “Offering”) of shares of our common stock pursuant to which we offered 53,270,000 shares at a price of $10 per share in our primary offering and 965,331 shares of common stock at a price of $9.50 per share in our distribution reinvestment plan (the “DRP”).
On December 28, 2007, we terminated the primary component of the Offering. We had earlier terminated the DRP on November 16, 2007. Aggregate gross offering proceeds from the Offering totaled approximately $538.7 million and net offering proceeds after selling commissions, dealer manager fees, and organization and offering expenses totaled approximately $481.8 million. We used the net proceeds from the Offering primarily to acquire real estate and real estate-related assets consistent with our investment objectives.
On November 16, 2007, we commenced a second distribution reinvestment plan offering (the “Second DRP”) of up to 6,315,790 shares of common stock at an initial price of $9.50 per share. Shares in the Second DRP were sold at $8.17 from July 26, 2009 through January 14, 2010; at $8.03 from January 15, 2010 through January 13, 2011; and $7.66 from January 14, 2011 through April 15, 2011 as a result of our board of directors announcing estimated per share values pursuant to our amended and restated policy for estimation of common stock value (the “Valuation Policy”) of $8.17, $8.03, and $7.66 on June 22, 2009, January 8, 2010, and January 10, 2011, respectively. We terminated the Second DRP effective April 15, 2011. As of the termination of the Second DRP, we had issued 3,374,198 shares under the Second DRP resulting in gross and net proceeds of $29.8 million. The proceeds raised in the Second DRP were used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, investment in real estate and real estate-related securities, payment of fees and other costs, repayment of debt, and funding for our share redemption program.
As of December 31, 2016, we had issued 56,500,472 shares of our common stock, including 21,739 shares indirectly owned by Behringer, 940,387 shares issued pursuant to the DRP, 3,374,198 shares issued pursuant to the Second DRP, and redeemed 984,267 shares. In addition, we had 1,000 shares of non-participating, non-voting convertible stock outstanding and no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding.
Our common stock is not listed on a national exchange.
Investment Objectives
On January 30, 2017, our stockholders approved the Plan of Liquidation. Pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation, over the course of the next 24 months we intend to dispose of all of our assets, liquidate and dissolve, and distribute the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders. Our focus for 2017 and into 2018 is on selling our assets in an orderly manner and completing the liquidation and dissolution process while continuing to sustain and enhance the property values through additional leasing or capital expenditures, where necessary. 
Our investment policies were designed in order that we could make investments that were consistent with our focus on acquiring properties with significant possibilities for capital appreciation. When making investment decisions, we followed rigorous acquisition criteria and closing conditions and reviewed other required documentation. These criteria were designed to assess and manage investment risks and support our basis for making investment decisions in the best interests of our stockholders.
Our investment objectives were:

• | to realize growth in the value of our investments to enhance the value received upon our ultimate sale of such investments;


• | to preserve, protect, and return stockholders’ capital contribution through our ultimate sale of our investments; and


• | to provide stockholders with a return of their investment by liquidating and distributing net sales proceeds.

Investment Policies
We have invested in commercial properties, such as office, retail, multifamily, industrial, hospitality, and recreation and leisure properties that were initially identified as opportunistic and value-add investments with significant possibilities for capital appreciation due to their property specific characteristics or their market characteristics. We have disposed of 17 of our original portfolio assets through December 31, 2016. On January 30, 2017, our stockholders approved the Plan of Liquidation, and we are focused on successfully implementing the provisions of the Plan of Liquidation, including the orderly disposition of our assets. Although we expect to complete our final disposition and make a final liquidating distribution to our stockholders within 24 months of the adoption of the Plan of Liquidation, we can make no assurances as to the timing in which we will complete this process. Economic or market conditions may delay our ability to make a final liquidating distribution within a 24-month period.
Our real estate investments are held in fee title or a long-term leasehold estate through the Operating Partnership or indirectly through limited liability companies or through investments in joint ventures, partnerships, co-tenancies or other co-ownership arrangements with the developers of the properties or other persons.
Borrowing Policies 
There is no limitation on the amount we may invest in or borrow related to any single property or other investment. Under our charter, the maximum amount of our indebtedness shall not exceed 300% of the Company’s “net assets” (as defined in our charter) as of the date of any borrowing; however, we may exceed that limit if approved by a majority of our board of directors. In addition to our charter limitation and indebtedness target, our board has adopted a policy to limit our aggregate borrowings to approximately 75% of the aggregate value of our assets, unless substantial justification exists that borrowing a greater amount is in our best interests. Our policy limitation, however, does not apply to individual real estate assets. Our board of directors reviews the Company’s aggregate borrowings at least quarterly. We believe that these borrowing limitations reduce risk of loss and are in the best interests of the Company’s stockholders.
Disposition Policies
On January 30, 2017, our stockholders approved the Plan of Liquidation and we are focused on selling our remaining assets in an orderly manner in order to sell our assets, pay our liabilities, wind-up operations and dissolve within 24 months of the adoption of the Plan of Liquidation.
Tax Status
We elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and believe that we have qualified as a REIT since the year ended December 31, 2006. As long as we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax at the corporate level (except for the operations of our wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiaries), to the extent that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders on an annual basis. We currently expect that we will continue to qualify as a REIT prior to the final distribution of assets pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we also will be disqualified for taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we lose our qualification. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state, local, and foreign taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
Competition
We are subject to significant competition in seeking tenants for the leasing of our properties and buyers to purchase our properties. In addition, as we seek to dispose of our assets, we suffer from a lack of demand for opportunistic asset types such as land and development properties. We compete with many third parties engaged in real estate investment activities, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, hedge funds, governmental bodies, and other entities. We also face competition from other real estate investment programs for buyers and tenants that may be suitable for us. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may have substantially more operating experience than either us or the Advisor. 
Regulations
Our investments are subject to various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations (including those of foreign jurisdictions), including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution, and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments.
7

Environmental
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state, and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies, new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future.
Distribution Policies
Distributions are authorized at the discretion of our board of directors based on its analysis of our forthcoming cash needs, earnings, cash flow, anticipated cash flow, capital expenditure requirements, cash on hand, general financial condition and other factors that our board deems relevant. The board’s decision has been and will be influenced, in substantial part, by its obligation to ensure that we maintain our status as a REIT. On March 28, 2011, our board of directors discontinued regular quarterly distributions. We have not paid any distributions since 2011.
As part of our stockholder approved Plan of Liquidation, we currently anticipate paying one or more liquidating distributions to our stockholders. We expect to pay the final liquidating distribution to our stockholders no later than 24 months of the adoption of the Plan of Liquidation, although the timing of this distribution will depend on when we sell our assets and settle our liabilities. We can provide no assurances that the final distribution will be paid within a 24-month period.
The Plan of Liquidation gives us the authority, in our discretion, to determine how best to provide for any unknown or contingent liabilities consistent with Maryland law. We may obtain insurance policies to cover such costs and/or establish a reserve fund out of which to pay such costs. If a reserve fund is established, we would expect a final liquidating distribution to be paid once the manager of the reserve fund determines that no further claims are likely to be made. Such a determination could be made, for example, upon the expiration of the time periods specified in the statutes of limitations applicable to the type of claims that may be made against the reserve. If a reserve fund is created, the final payout of our assets remaining after payment of claims against the reserve fund to our stockholders may not occur for three or more years following the filing of our Articles of Dissolution.
The actual amounts and times of payment of the liquidating distributions to be paid to our stockholders will be determined by our board of directors in its discretion. 
Significant Tenants 
As of December 31, 2016, we had one lease that accounted for 10% or more of our aggregate annual rental revenue from our consolidated office properties. A tenant at our Northpoint office building accounted for $1 million (or 14%) of our aggregate annual rental revenue from office buildings and 2% of our total revenues. The lease expires July 31, 2017. See Item 2, Properties for additional information on our office building leases.
The following table presents information about our significant tenant lease at our consolidated office properties as of December 31, 2016:

_______________________________________________________________________________

(1) | Annualized Base Rent Statistics reflect contractual base rental income from our consolidated office properties without consideration of tenant contraction or termination rights. Tenant reimbursements generally include payment of real estate taxes, operating expenses, and common area maintenance and utility charges. 

Employees
We have no employees. The Advisor and, during a transition period while the advisory services provided to us by the Behringer Advisor are transferred to the Advisor, other affiliates of the Behringer Advisor perform a full range of real estate services for us, including dispositions, accounting, legal, asset management, property management, and investor relations services.
8

We are dependent on affiliates of the Advisor, and for a period of time, the Behringer Advisor, for services that are essential to us, including the execution of the Plan of Liquidation, asset disposition decisions, property management and leasing services, and other general administrative responsibilities. In the event that these companies were unable to provide these services to us, we would be required to provide such services ourselves or obtain such services from other sources.
