     ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
     Overview
     We design, manufacture and sell precision vascular robotic-assisted systems for use in interventional vascular procedures (the “CorPath® System”). The CorPath System is the first medical device cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to bring robotic-assisted precision to radial, coronary and peripheral procedures. During these procedures, the interventional cardiologist sits at a radiation-shielded workstation to advance interventional devices with millimeter-by-millimeter precision. The workstation allows the physician greater control and the freedom from wearing heavy lead protective equipment that can cause musculoskeletal injuries. The CorPath System brings robotic precision to radial and complex interventional procedures to help optimize clinical outcomes and minimize the costs associated with complications of improper stent placement with manual procedures. In October 2016, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our CorPath GRX System, the second generation of the CorPath System. CorPath GRX significantly builds upon the CorPath 200 platform, adding a significant number of key upgrades that increase precision, improve workflow, and extend the capabilities and range of the procedures that can be performed robotically. These features include active guide management which enables control of the guide catheter along with robotic control of the guidewire and balloon or stent catheter, with one-millimeter advancement, from the control console. This precise positioning will enable physicians to adjust guide catheter position during procedures, and may expand use of CorPath to more complex cases. We began commercial shipment of the CorPath GRX System in late January 2017. While the CorPath GRX has been cleared for and we are targeting percutaneous coronary intervention procedures and peripheral vascular interventions, we believe our technology platform has the capability to be developed in the future for other segments of the vascular intervention market, including neurointerventional procedures and other more complex cardiac interventions such as structural heart procedures. As of December 31, 2017, we have installed 33 CorPath GRX Systems. Additionally, as of December 31, 2017, we shipped six CorPath GRX Systems that were accepted by a distributor. During 2017, the majority of our consumable revenues relate to the sale of CorPath GRX System cassettes and accessories.     Corporate History
     Our Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 4, 2011 under the name “Your Internet Defender Inc.” On August 12, 2014, we closed (the “Closing”) a reverse acquisition transaction (the “Acquisition”) in which we acquired Corindus, Inc. and Corindus Security Corporation as wholly owned subsidiaries. Immediately following the Closing, the business of Corindus, Inc. became our sole focus. We subsequently changed our name to Corindus Vascular Robotics, Inc. and increased our authorized capital stock to 260,000,000 shares (250,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.0001 par value per share). Effective June 28, 2016, our Company changed its state of incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware.
     On May 28, 2015, we completed a public offering by issuing 12,650,000 shares of our common stock at $3.80 per share in exchange for proceeds of $44,392,000 net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering costs. In connection with the public offering, our common stock was approved for listing on the NYSE American, where it commenced trading on May 29, 2015 under the symbol “CVRS.” Our Company’s common stock was previously traded on the OTCQB as provided by OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the symbol “CVRS.”
     Percutaneous Coronary Intervention History and Development
     PCI, sometimes known as coronary angioplasty, is a non-surgical technique used to open stenotic (narrowed or blocked) coronary arteries found in coronary artery disease. Coronary arteries supply the heart muscle with blood. PCI requires the use of a cardiac catheterization suite (sometimes called a cath lab) with special equipment, x-ray capability and trained personnel. Usually, access to the patient’s heart and major blood vessels is obtained percutaneously through the femoral artery in the groin area. The artery is punctured through the skin with a special needle. Under x-ray guidance, a guide catheter is introduced through the femoral artery up to the aorta (large artery from the heart) and then gently advanced into the blocked coronary artery. The catheter and its devices are passed through the inside of the artery into an area of coronary artery narrowing or blockage. At the leading tip of this catheter, several different devices (such as a balloon, stent or cutting device) can be deployed. A balloon is used to open the coronary artery and restore blood flow. Usually at that time, a stent (a mesh-like tube that holds open the artery) is placed to maintain good blood flow through the damaged area.
     PCI is the single highest-volume vascular intervention, with more than 3.6 million procedures performed on a global basis annually according to J.P. Morgan’s 2016 Interventional Cardiology Market Model. PCI can be used to relieve or reduce angina, prevent heart attacks and alleviate congestive heart failure and allows some patients to avoid open heart surgery, which often involves an extensive procedure and a long rehabilitation period.
     The first PCI procedure, then known as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, was performed in Zurich in September 1977 by Andreas Gruentzig, a Swiss radiologist. The early procedures had limited success due to risks associated with the use of large guide catheters that could easily rupture the vessel, no availability of guidewires and large balloon catheters with low burst pressure points. From 1977 to 1986, guide catheters, guidewires and balloon catheter technology were improved, with slimmer profiles and increased tolerance to higher inflation pressure. Stents, first introduced in 1986, are now used in most coronary interventions. The utility of stents has substantially increased procedural safety and success, thus significantly reducing the need for emergency coronary artery bypass surgery.
     Occupational Hazards of Catheterization Labs
     While there has been significant innovation in the devices and diagnostic tools used in interventional cardiology procedures, the way the manual procedures are generally performed by physicians has remained virtually unchanged since the first procedure by Dr. Gruentzig over 40 years ago. In order to perform the procedure, a physician stands by the patient who is lying on the cath lab table. The physician wears cumbersome and heavy protective apparel containing lead to block exposure to the ionizing radiation of x-rays used in the procedure and thereby combat its adverse effects. Already under bodily strain, the physician must deliver constant x-ray exposures to view the different vessels, which provides visual guidance for manual manipulation of interventional devices inside the patient’s heart. In addition to these physical demands, the current manual methods of performing PCI procedures make it difficult for physicians to visualize and estimate the length of the blocked lesion that requires the treatment, often leading to improper device selection and poor placement accuracy.
       2
 
     Interventional cardiologists who perform vascular interventional procedures face life-threatening risks from excessive radiation exposure, may suffer significant occupational hazards and must overcome procedural challenges when performing traditional coronary interventions. The chronic ionizing x-ray radiation exposure to the physician’s eyes associated with traditional PCI can cause posterior lens opacities, early cataracts and cancer malignancies. Orthopedic injuries from standing for long periods of time while wearing heavy radiation protection are also common, as are chronic pain complaints and missed physician workdays. In light of these risks, several professional societies and governmental agencies worldwide have called for reductions in radiation to improve catheterization laboratory safety.
     Research shows that interventional cardiologists experience among the highest levels of radiation exposure of any medical professional, which leads to increased risk for cancer and cataract formation in addition to increased levels of orthopedic strain from the use of heavy protective garments required to block such exposure. In a study of 36 physicians (of which 28 were interventional cardiologists) with brain tumors potentially linked to radiation exposure over their careers, 86% had left-sided tumors, indicating a correlation with the physician’s position at the cath lab table. Additionally, in a survey of interventional cardiologists conducted by the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, 49.4% reported at least one orthopedic injury, 6.9% were required to limit their caseload due to radiation exposure, and 9.3% experienced health-related periods of absence. Many hospitals will not allow female interventional cardiologists to practice during pregnancy, while others require them to wear lead protective gear with twice the typical thickness to protect from radiation exposure.
     We believe that the future of interventional procedures, where the physician sits inside the cath lab within a radiation-shielded interventional cockpit, will be greatly improved through the use of advanced robotic tools that provide (i) enhanced safety for the catheterization lab staff relative to radiation exposure, (ii) improved patient procedures through advanced precision, dexterity and visualization for the physician and (iii) an economically compelling solution for the hospital. We are pioneering the use of precision vascular robotics to achieve these goals and to improve the way that minimally invasive vascular interventions are performed.
     Our Precision Robotics Systems
     We design, manufacture and sell our CorPath System for use in radial and complex interventional vascular procedures to bring the precision and accuracy of the only FDA-cleared robotic platform to facilitate stent positioning for PCI procedures by allowing a physician to measure, manipulate and advance devices with robotic precision. Additionally, our CorPath System allows the physician to perform PCI procedures with a control console located within an interventional cockpit. While the CorPath GRX has been cleared for and we are targeting PCI procedures and the CorPath 200 has been cleared for an additional indication for peripheral vascular interventions, we believe our technology platform has the capability to be developed in the future for other segments of the vascular intervention market, including neurointerventional procedures and other more complex cardiac interventions such as structural heart procedures.
     The CorPath GRX System enables the precise, robotic-assisted control of coronary guide catheters, guidewires and balloon/stent devices from the safety of a radiation-shielded interventional cockpit. The CorPath GRX System consists of two components: a Bedside Unit and an Interventional Cockpit. The radiation-shielded cockpit features a simple-to-use Control Console to precisely control the movement of guide catheters, guidewires, and balloon/stent catheters. Using joysticks and touch-screen controls, the physician is able to measure lengths of portions of anatomy to help in selecting the appropriate stent. At the bedside, the CorPath GRX System’s Robotic Drive and sterile, single-use cassette (“CorPath Cassette”) translate the physician’s commands into precise movements and manipulations of the coronary guide catheters, guidewires, stents and catheters. The CorPath GRX Cassette provides a single-use sterile interface with standard PCI catheters, guidewires and devices. The CorPath GRX System empowers physicians with precise sub-millimeter measurement and 1mm advancement accuracy. By optimizing stent selection and positioning, the CorPath GRX System enables the deliberate advancement of devices, provides the ability to hold the guidewire and balloon/stent in place during device deployment and helps to ensure that there are no unintended wire/device movements during the procedure.
     The CorPath GRX System allows the interventional cardiologist to perform the procedure while seated in an ergonomic and comfortable position in a radiation-shielded cockpit positioned as close as a few feet away from the patient. Our radiation-shielded cockpit provides a reduction in radiation exposure for the primary operator as compared to levels found at the traditional table position for manual procedures. The cockpit allows the physician to control the procedure while seated outside of the radiation field without the need for heavy protective wear. The Percutaneous Robotically-Enhanced Coronary Intervention Study (the “PRECISE Study”) published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (the “JACC”), which we sponsored using the CorPath 200 System, demonstrated a 95.2% reduction in radiation exposure to the primary operator. The CorPath GRX System also provides physicians with enhanced visualization of the procedure through a high resolution widescreen monitor positioned at eye level in the cockpit. These improvements have the potential to reduce physician fatigue and could potentially extend a physician’s medical career. A photo of our CorPath GRX System appears below.

     Overview of Industry and Market
     Vascular Market
     We developed vascular robotic technology to provide physicians with protection from the occupational hazards of the cath lab and to provide them with robotic precision while executing vascular procedures. Our initial indication for use of the CorPath System is for PCI and peripheral vascular procedures. We believe our technology can be applied to various vascular clinical applications and markets, including neurointerventional and structural heart, and we may decide to pursue these markets in the future.     Coronary Market (PCI)
     Our current target market is all cardiac cath labs in the U.S. The IMV 2013 Cardiac Cath Lab Market summary report estimates that there are more than 3,250 cath lab rooms in the U.S. performing PCI procedures, which represents approximately 40% of the global market of more than 8,000 PCI cath lab rooms. According to the J.P. Morgan 2016 Interventional Cardiology Market report, there are over 3.6 million PCI procedures performed worldwide each year and approximately 940,000 procedures performed each year in the U.S. The portion of the U.S. cath lab rooms qualifying as customers likely to purchase our product is difficult to ascertain because potential customers are determined by our sales team on a case-by-case basis and is somewhat subjective based on the priorities of each individual facility. Cath lab patient volume has decreased over the past several years, leading to increased competition for patients.     Peripheral Vascular Market
     According to Millenium Research Group’s 2013 report on U.S. Markets for Peripheral Devices, approximately 1.7 million peripheral vascular procedures are performed annually worldwide (approximately 40% of those in the U.S.) and the annual procedure volumes are expected to grow to over 2.3 million procedures worldwide by 2018. While some peripheral procedures are conducted in cath labs that also conduct PCI procedures, IMV’s 2012 Interventional Angiography Lab Market summary report estimates that there are over 3,500 non-PCI peripheral vascular labs worldwide which represent incremental CorPath System placement opportunities beyond PCI.     Neurointerventional Market
     Medtech Insight’s 2011 report on U.S. Markets for Neurosurgical and Neurointerventional Surgical Products estimates that 395,000 neurointerventional procedures are performed each year, 160,000 in the U.S. and 235,000 internationally, and that the annual volume will grow to an estimated 720,000 worldwide procedures by 2018. The number of incremental, dedicated system worldwide sales opportunities exceeds 400 labs, with 40% in the U.S. and 60% outside the U.S. (“International”).     Structural Heart Market
     The number of structural heart procedures has been growing and is expected to continue to grow significantly, with an estimated 40,000 worldwide procedures currently performed annually (25% U.S., 75% International) expected to grow to an estimated 120,000 annual structural heart procedures by the year 2018, according to a 2013 clinical report in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.     Our Business Model
     Our business model involves the launching of coronary robotic-assisted intervention programs which include the sale of a durable robotic system and a repeat consumable. After the program launch and the sale and installation of the CorPath System in a hospital cath lab, we provide customer support through training and sales of our CorPath Cassette, which provides a sterile interface with standard PCI guide catheters, guidewires and devices. The CorPath Cassette is consumed and replaced for each new patient procedure. The use of the CorPath Cassettes represents opportunity for recurring revenue for each PCI procedure using the CorPath System. We also sell service contracts providing various levels of ongoing service. Over time, we expect to have follow-on sales related to the CorPath System to offer and install robotic system upgrades with more features and new applications.
     Our current product line is marketed and sold in the United States by our direct sales team that calls on interventional cardiologists, catheterization lab departments and executive administrators in hospitals across the U.S. to launch coronary robotic-assisted intervention programs and drive sales of our CorPath System and our CorPath Cassette. We employ two different types of sales representatives in the field. Our Regional Sales Managers (“RSMs”) operate as full line sales professionals responsible for selling CorPath Systems, Cassettes and all other associated disposable accessories. Our Clinical Specialists (“Clinicals”) focus on clinical education and training of physicians and their staff and selling CorPath Cassettes as well as associated disposable accessories.
     The RSMs are responsible for identifying potential customers in the more than 3,250 cath lab rooms performing PCI procedures in the U.S. that desire to launch a coronary robotic-assisted intervention program and purchase a CorPath System. The RSMs may sell the CorPath System as a capital sale or through third-party financed leasing or rental programs. The RSMs are also responsible for selling service contracts for the CorPath System. The RSMs are supported by our marketing department, which provides them with leads and sales opportunities garnered through direct marketing activities at interventional cardiology conferences, online webinars, regional seminars and trade journal advertising. Our marketing department also provides the RSMs with the sales tools and marketing resources to help convey the value proposition of the CorPath System.
     Our Clinicals focus their efforts on selling our CorPath Cassettes and other associated disposable accessories designed to maintain a sterile environment when using our products in a cath lab. They are responsible for increasing their account sales through new orders and repeat consumable sales within their specific accounts. The Clinicals build important relationships throughout the CorPath System installed base accounts, including with the interventional cardiologists, the cath lab technologists, nurses, cath lab directors, schedulers, purchasers and administrators. The Clinicals are responsible for ongoing training and development of the CorPath System installed base accounts to build successful CorPath robotic programs and expand system usage across physicians. The Clinicals are also responsible for ensuring purchase orders are obtained and that appropriate inventory levels are maintained on site.

     Driving Utilization of the CorPath System
     Following the launch of the coronary robotic-assisted intervention program and the initial sale of a CorPath System to a hospital, we provide enhanced training to the primary physicians and cath lab staff responsible for launching the program and then work to secure an increase in the number of cases performed over time. Subsequently, we expand training to the next group of physicians who use the system. We consistently focus our efforts to make sure that the system is well integrated into the customer’s everyday workflow within the cath lab. Dedicated sales and marketing efforts support awareness and use of the CorPath System. Utilization support comes both from encouraging the use of the system within customer accounts and by providing materials to educate general cardiologists and patients on the availability of the CorPath System at the customer site and in their geographical area.
     The CorPath System uses a proprietary single-use sterile cassette, which is the source of recurring revenue as use of the CorPath System continues and increases. After a CorPath System is installed and initial training is complete, we provide ongoing support in order to increase customers’ familiarity with system features and benefits with the goal of increasing usage of the CorPath System.
     Service Revenue
     One year of customer support and warranty is included with the sale of each CorPath System. Thereafter, we sell service contracts under which we continue to provide support after the one-year period. We anticipate that service beyond the basic warranty will become an increasingly important additional source of revenue.     Our Growth Strategy
     Our goal is to ensure that the coronary robotic-assisted intervention program and the use of the CorPath System becomes the standard of care for interventional procedures by providing unsurpassed protection for cath lab staff and being the leading precision robotic technology for patient procedures. We have identified key characteristics and criteria for customers that are imperative to implement a successful cardiovascular robotics program. We are meaningfully narrowing our target customers focus with the intent to be deeply integrated within our customer partnerships. We are working with selected customers around the country to establish CorPath System centers of excellence. These centers allow us to bring prospective customers to visit a hospital and cath lab that has previously installed a CorPath System. The robotic course visit will allow the prospective customer the opportunity to see the system installed and in use. It also provides the opportunity to discuss the benefits of the system with the hospital staff, including interventional cardiologists, technologists and administrators, and view the work flow of the system in a real life clinical setting. We have successfully conducted such courses at several sites around the country and we are continuing to establish these centers of excellence and collaborative relationships with key institutions.
     We intend to establish our Company and technology as the brand that cares about and supports the physician and cath lab staff by leading the industry in providing solutions that address and remedy their occupational hazards. By promoting safety and providing awareness of occupational hazards in the cath lab and supporting education about solutions, we hope to become the preferred source for customers seeking to improve the safety of their operations.
     A second prong of our growth strategy is to expand into new clinical segments. In addition to our objective to make the CorPath System the premier standard for PCI procedures, we may decide to pursue additional vascular interventional applications for our vascular robotic-assisted technology. Our closest adjacent opportunity is in peripheral vascular procedures performed by interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists. The CorPath GRX System was cleared for use in peripheral vascular interventions in February 2018. These procedures treat vascular disease in non-coronary areas like the patient’s legs. These procedures are often quite lengthy and they expose physicians to x-ray radiation for extended periods of time. The peripheral vascular procedure market has been growing rapidly and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 5.9% based on iData’s October 2013 Research Report: “US Markets for Peripheral Vascular Devices and Accessories.”
     Further expansion into neuro-interventional procedures to treat stroke, brain aneurysms and other diseases of the head and neck could allow us to leverage precision robotic-assisted tools into these highly precise procedures which are very well reimbursed.
     Another area of future growth is the emerging market of structural heart procedures. This market segment is experiencing rapid growth due to the advent of new catheter-delivered medical devices that are replacing open surgical procedures. One of the most prominent new devices in this market is the transcatheter aortic valve. The transcatheter aortic valve replacement (“TAVR”) procedure requires very complex integration of a variety of imaging modalities and precise deployment of the device. Our interventional cockpit and robotic-assisted control could potentially provide significant benefits to the execution of TAVR procedures.
     Any of these potential applications would require additional clinical trials and various levels of research, engineering, software development, product development, system modifications and regulatory approvals.
     An integral part of our growth strategy is to expand commercialization beyond the U.S. marketplace. Opportunities outside of the U.S. represent over 60% of the global procedure volume and are growing at a rate faster than the U.S. market. We intend to expand into and penetrate these new geographical international markets over time by leveraging our product development, clinical research and regulatory approvals gained in the U.S. Our initial international target markets include the Middle East, Northern Europe and Japan. We have a CE Mark for the CorPath System which permits us to commercially distribute these systems throughout the European Union. In February 2017, we announced the signing of a strategic distribution agreement with Japan Medicalnext Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned entity of MC Healthcare, Inc., (subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corporation) and prominent supplier of medical devices in Japan. Pursuant to the agreement, Japan Medicalnext became the exclusive distributor of our products in Japan. Japan is the third largest market for PCI, with an approximate annual volume of 250,000 procedures. We are working together with our distributor to secure Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency (“PMDA”) approval as the first step in preparing for the commercial launch of CorPath GRX in Japan, which we expect to occur in the first half of 2018.
     Research and Development
     We have built a leading Research and Development (“R&D”) organization comprised of mechanical, electrical, systems and software engineers with deep expertise in med-tech and robotics. We expect our investment in R&D to expand the capabilities of our robotic system – allowing for control and delivery of a wide range of interventional devices across the cardiovascular, peripheral and neurovascular spaces. In addition to scaling capabilities of our robotic platform, our technology roadmap includes development programs for tele-stenting, procedural automation, and artificial intelligence. Tele-stenting, or remote robotic treatment for PCI, will enable physicians to conduct procedures from virtually any location. Procedural automation will focus on automating techniques from the best physicians in the world – making them available to every hospital with a robotic PCI program. Our long-term vision is to enable autonomous navigation of medical devices for interventional procedures. Our artificial intelligence capabilities will leverage deep learning and algorithms to reduce variability of treatment and improve quality of care. Our research and development activities relating to tele-stenting, procedural automation, and other artificial intelligence capabilities are in early stages and we can provide no assurances that we will be able to successfully develop and commercialize this technology.
       5
 
     In addition to expanding the capabilities of the CorPath System, we will continue to invest in the design of system manufacturability improvements which we expect to result in a lower cost system and cassette. The engineering function will use Design for Manufacturability and Assembly (“DFMA”) processes in an effort to reduce costs. DFMA is the combination of two methodologies: Design for Manufacture, which means the design for ease of manufacture of the parts that will form a product, and Design for Assembly, which means the design of the product for ease of assembly. DFMA is used as the basis for concurrent engineering studies to provide guidance to the design team in simplifying the product structure to reduce manufacturing and assembly costs and to quantify improvements. DFMA is a component of lean manufacturing.
     Research and development expense amounted to approximately $9.5 million, $10.3 million and $10.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
     Clinical Studies
     We are dedicated to continually advancing robotic-assisted PCI through the publication of clinical data supporting the CorPath System’s value and applicability. We are working with several leading institutions to conduct clinical research activities to further collect evidence regarding the applicability and benefits of robotic-assisted procedures. We are committed to collaboration with prominent interventional cardiologists to build evidence for the benefits of robotic-assisted PCI. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities to develop further evidence for the benefits of the CorPath GRX System in practice. An important component to making the CorPath GRX System the standard of care in the cath lab will be to demonstrate the clinical benefits and applicability of the CorPath GRX System and the advancement of robotic-assisted procedures.     First in Man Trial
     In April 2011, the First in Man Trial for the CorPath Robotic-assisted PCI System was published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiologists. This clinical trial enrolled eight patients with coronary artery disease who required a PCI procedure at the Corbic Research Institute in Envigado, Colombia. All patients were treated for a single de novo coronary lesion up to 25mm in length located in a vessel 2.5-4.0 mm in diameter. The procedure was successfully completed in all eight patients utilizing the CorPath System to advance coronary guidewires and perform the intervention, and there were no reported device or procedure-related complications or major adverse events. Operator radiation exposure was 97% lower with the use of the CorPath System in comparison with levels found at the standard table position.
     CorPath PRECISE Study
     We sponsored the PRECISE Study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the clinical and technical performance of the CorPath System in the delivery and manipulation of coronary guidewires and balloon/stent devices for use in PCI procedures. We sponsored the PRECISE Study under Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) approval from the FDA to obtain 510(k) clearance. The PRECISE Study was a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, non-randomized trial of the CorPath System. We enrolled 164 patients who were evaluated at nine clinical sites (eight in the U.S.). The PRECISE Study was conducted under Principal Investigators Dr. Giora Weisz, MD Associate Professor of Medicine at Columbia University Medical Center and Chairman of Cardiology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel, and Dr. Joseph Carrozza, Chief of Cardiovascular Medicine at St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center in Boston. Physicians participating in the trial did not receive any direct financial compensation. Results of the PRECISE Study were published in the April 2013 issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology and reported a successful PCI completion with use of the CorPath System in 162 of the 164 cases. In each of the two cases in which the PCI procedure was not completed, the interventionalist left the CorPath cockpit to complete the procedure manually, resulting in an incomplete use of the CorPath System. The average radiation exposure to the cardiovascular interventionalist decreased by 95.2% in comparison with levels measured at the location where manual procedures are normally conducted during standard interventions. The overall rate of clinical procedure success was 97.6%, with 100% of patients achieving post-procedure stenosis of less than 30% (as evaluated by a Core Laboratory), and 97.6% of patients had an absence of Major Adverse Cardiac Events (“MACE”). The four MACE events that did arise in the PRECISE Study were cardiac enzyme elevations without symptoms. There were no device-related complications.
     CorPath PRECISION Registry
     In 2013, we initiated the PRECISION Registry, a multicenter post-market registry for the evaluation of the CorPath 200 System’s effectiveness in PCI procedures. PRECISION aimed to collect data on real-world use of the CorPath System. We were interested in learning about the patterns of the CorPath System’s use, safety and effectiveness from a broad registry participation perspective. Sixteen sites participated in the PRECISION registry. A subset of the data was presented as a Late Breaking Clinical Trial at SCAI 2017.
     CorPath PRECISION GRX Registry
     In 2017, we launched the PRECISION GRX registry, a multicenter post-market registry for the evaluation of the CorPath GRX System’s effectiveness in PCI procedures. PRECISION GRX aims to collect data on real-world use of the CorPath GRX System. With the addition of Active Guide Management we build on the data and experience gained from PRECISION with a focus on how adding guide catheter control impacts the overall outcome measures. There are currently 6 sites participating in the PRECISION GRX Registry, which is conducted under the leadership of Dr. Ehtisham Mahmud. Each site obtained approval to participate in the PRECISION GRX Registry from its hospital Institutional Review Board as part of the site’s regular clinical research approval process and other industry-standard protections are in place for patients enrolled in the post-market study. Data for the registry is being collected and monitored through industry-standard clinical research procedures.

     Robotically-Assisted Peripheral Intervention for peripheral arterial Disease Study (RAPID)
     The Robotically-Assisted Peripheral Intervention for peripheral arterial Disease (RAPID) Study to evaluate the safety and performance of the CorPath 200 System for use in percutaneous vascular interventions was completed in 2015. The RAPID trial was a single-arm, single center study conducted at the Medical University of Graz in Graz, Austria. The RAPID trial was led by Prof. Dr. Marianne Brodmann, MD, a leading researcher within the University’s Division of Angiology, in combination with Prof. Dr. Hannes Deutschmann, of the Medical University of Graz Department of Radiology, and study chairman, Dr. Ehtisham Mahmud, director, Sulpizio Cardiovascular Center-Medicine, UC San Diego. The trial was a prospective, single-arm, single-center study that enrolled 20 subjects to assess the safety and effectiveness of the CorPath System in recanalizing lower extremity arterial blockages during peripheral angioplasty procedures. Results of the RAPID Study were presented in a major cardiology conference. The PAD presentation (Rutherford Classification) was primarily severe (60%) or moderate (30%) claudication. A total of 29 lesions located in the superficial femoral (89.7%) or popliteal (10.3%) arteries were treated. Device technical success and clinical procedural success was 100%. Three minor procedure-related adverse events, all access site hematomas, were reported. There were no device-related complications. In 2016, the RAPID trial was published in JACC. The data was used to support FDA 510(k) clearance for the CorPath 200, therefore all devices used had to be FDA approved. This requirement limited robotic-assisted PVI to rapid exchange PTA balloons. In a subsequent study, RAPID II, femoropopliteal lesions were treated with robotic-assisted drug-coated balloons, allowing for a completely robotic-assisted PCI procedure. The results of this study are expected to be released later in 2018.
     Staff Exposure to X-ray during PCI: CorPath vs. Manual: An Observational Study
     The Staff Exposure to X-ray during PCI: CorPath vs. Manual: An Observational Study to compare cardiac catheterization staff and physician radiation exposure in robotic-assisted PCI with the CorPath 200 System vs. that in manual PCI was completed in 2015. This observational study was led by Dr. Paul T. Campbell, MD, a leading interventional cardiologist at Carolinas Medical Center – NorthEast, Concord, NC. The trial was a prospective, randomized, dual-arm, single-center study that enrolled 30 patients. This observational study showed a significant reduction in physician radiation exposure, and reduction in staff radiation exposure in the robotic-assisted PCI arm compared to the manual PCI arm.
     Our Current Product Line
     Our first product, the CorPath 200 System, brought the precision and accuracy of robotic technology to PCI procedures performed in an interventional cath lab. The CorPath 200 System is intended for use in the remote delivery and manipulation of coronary guidewires and rapid exchange balloon/stent catheters during PCI procedures and in the remote delivery and manipulation of guidewires and rapid exchange catheters during peripheral percutaneous vascular interventional procedures. The second generation CorPath GRX System is intended for use in the remote delivery and manipulation of guidewires and rapid exchange balloon/stent devices, and remote manipulation of guide catheters during percutaneous coronary intervention procedures and peripheral procedures. There is no contraindication for the use of either product in PCI procedures.
     The CorPath System enables the precise, robotic-assisted control of coronary guidewires, guide catheters and balloon/stent devices from the safety of a radiation-shielded, ergonomic interventional cockpit. The CorPath System consists of two components: a bedside unit and an interventional cockpit. The radiation-shielded cockpit features a simple-to-use control console to precisely control the movement of guide catheters, guidewires and balloon/stent catheters. The bedside unit translates the physician’s commands into precise movements and manipulations of the coronary stents and catheters contained in a single-use cassette.
     The CorPath Cassette provides a sterile interface with standard PCI guidewires and guide catheter devices and is replaced for each new patient procedure.
     In July 2012, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the CorPath 200 System and initiated a limited commercial launch in the U.S.
     In October 2015, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our robotic-assisted CorPath 200 System to be used during PCI procedures performed via radial access. The 510(k) clearance was based on results of a clinical trial conducted at Spectrum Health, Grand Rapids, Michigan, and St. Joseph’s Hospital Health Center, Syracuse, New York.
     In March 2016, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our robotic-assisted CorPath 200 System to be used during peripheral vascular interventions. The 510(k) clearance was based on results of a clinical trial conducted at Medical University of Graz in Graz, Austria.
     In October 2016, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our CorPath GRX, the second generation of our CorPath System. In February 2018, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for CorPath GRX to be used during peripheral vascular interventions. The CorPath GRX System is intended for use in the remote delivery and manipulation of guidewires and rapid exchange catheters, and remote manipulation of guide catheters during percutaneous coronary and vascular procedures.
     In March 2018, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the first automated robotic movement designed for the CorPath GRX platform. The software, named “Rotate on Retract” (RoR), is the first automated move in the technIQ™ Series. RoR allows the operator to quickly navigate to a targeted lesion by automatically rotating the guidewire upon joystick retraction. Over the next several years, we intend to focus on developing additional automated robotic movements to expand the technIQ™ Series.
     While we are initially targeting PCI and peripheral vascular procedures, we believe our open platform technology has the capability to be developed in the future to address all segments of the vascular intervention market, including neurointerventional procedures and other more complex cardiac interventions such as structural heart procedures.
     Products in Development
     Our product is tailored to maximize penetration and adoption of our CorPath System technology while providing the best clinical outcomes to our customers and their patients. Our vision for the future is to provide physicians with a complete tool box to robotically perform any interventional procedure desired. We are seeking to expand our penetration within PCI to more complex cases. As we see robotics as the center of the lab, we will continue to integrate other technologies into our robotic system to enable a complete solution for physicians. In order to accomplish this goal, we may investigate proprietary devices, imaging integration and electronic medical record integration while continuing to optimize the workflow in the lab and the remote program we have launched.

     Installed CorPath Systems and Backlog
     As of December 31, 2017, there were 31 CorPath GRX Systems installed in hospitals across the U.S. and two installed at international locations. Physicians and their teams in these locations have received training and procedures are currently being performed. Currently these sites have between one to three primary physicians using the CorPath System. RSMs and Clinicals visit installed sites regularly to support current users and also to expand usage to new targeted users. As of December 31, 2017, we had orders for seven additional CorPath GRX Systems which we had not yet shipped or installed.
     Intellectual Property
     Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Our intellectual property (“IP”) portfolio covers aspects of our CorPath System and cassettes, as well as other technology that we have under development, and is one of the means by which we attempt to protect our competitive position. We rely primarily on a combination of know-how, trade secrets, patents, trademarks and contractual restrictions to protect our products and to maintain our competitive position. We are seeking other ways to protect our intellectual property through various legal mechanisms in relevant jurisdictions.
     Our researchers and engineers work closely with our patent counsel to protect their inventions and intellectual property with patents issued around the world. We believe that we are building an extensive intellectual property portfolio to protect the fundamental scope of our technology, including our robotic technology, navigational methods, procedures, systems and consumable devices.
     As of January 31, 2018, we currently own more than 70 patents with more than 50 pending patent applications. Of these, we had more than 30 issued U.S. patents with more than 30 pending U.S. patent applications and over 40 granted foreign patents and more than 20 pending foreign applications. The granted foreign patents are in France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Israel, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The pending applications are in China, Europe (through applications filed in the European Patent Office), India and Japan. Additionally, there are three Patent Cooperation Treaty applications pending. Our granted patents begin expiring in 2018, and continue to expire through 2030.
     Our patents cover, among other things, technology related to robotic control of interventional devices, and the control of the CorPath System, including, but not limited to, the graphical and user interface, function and design of the CorPath Cassette, image-guided navigation for catheter-based interventions, measurement of the length of a structure, and radiation-protected work stations.
     In addition to our existing patent coverage, we continue to invest in product development and new IP to further enhance the capabilities of the CorPath System for PCI and other vascular applications. Relative to our current and future portfolio, we believe it will be costly and technically difficult to reverse engineer our products.
     We intend to actively protect our intellectual property with patents, trademarks, trade secrets or other legal avenues for the protection of intellectual property. We intend to aggressively prosecute, enforce and defend our patents, trademarks and proprietary technology. The loss, by expiration or otherwise, of any one patent may have a material effect on our business. Defense and enforcement of our IP rights can be expensive and time consuming, even if the outcome is favorable to us. It is possible that the patents issued or licensed to us will be successfully challenged. For example, a court may find that we are infringing on validly issued patents of third parties or that we may have to alter or discontinue the development of our products or pay licensing fees to take into account patent rights of third parties.
     As we continue to develop proprietary intellectual property, we will expand our protection by applying for patents on future technologies. While we seek broad coverage under our patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to the process may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringement claims. In addition, patents expire and we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending application or that any potentially issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property.
     Sales and Marketing
     We market, sell and support our products in the U.S. through our direct sales force of RSMs with support from our Clinicals who provide training and clinical support to our customers (collectively, our “Sales Team”). Our direct sales force is the primary distribution channel for CorPath System sales. Our Sales Team and headquarters-based marketing team work together to identify leads, evaluate clinical interest, navigate capital procurement processes and establish coronary robotic-assisted intervention programs, both in the United States and Internationally. Our sales and marketing program includes two important steps: selling CorPath Systems to the customer and then leveraging our installed base of systems to drive recurring sales of cassettes and service.
     Sales targeting is based on segmentation to identify customers who are likely to purchase and utilize the CorPath System and customers who are likely to be influencers in their region which will help fuel further growth. All hospitals with cath lab rooms that perform PCI procedures are potential customers for a CorPath System. The portion of the approximately 3,250 cath lab rooms in the U.S. that will qualify as customers likely to purchase a CorPath System is difficult to ascertain because potential customers are determined by our sales team on a case-by-case basis and is somewhat subjective based on the priorities of each individual physician and hospital facility. We believe customers that are likely to purchase our product meet a critical criteria profile including (i) an awareness of the dangers faced by interventional cardiologists due to radiation and ergonomic issues in the cath lab, (ii) a practice volume large enough to economically support the CorPath System, (iii) hospital financial health that allows for the capital or operational expenditure for a CorPath System and (iv) regional competitiveness that demands the implementation of new technology.
     Our sales effort begins with the interest of an influential physician; and, therefore, our marketing efforts are primarily directed toward interventional cardiologists. Our primary marketing objective is to raise awareness about the CorPath System and its features and benefits among our target customers.
     Marketing awareness activities target two strategies:
    
1) | General awareness – build knowledge and understanding of the value that the CorPath System brings to the cardiology community, focused initially on awareness from interventional cardiologists; and
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Targeted awareness – using data analysis to identify a target segment of customers (hospitals and physicians) for additional marketing and sales focus.

 We also market and sell our products through certain distributor and partnership relationships. We also entered into a distributor relationship with Alliant Enterprises, LLC who assists us in working with U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals. In February 2017, we announced the signing of a strategic distribution agreement with Japan Medicalnext Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned entity of MC Healthcare, Inc., (subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corporation) and prominent supplier of medical devices in Japan. Pursuant to the agreement, Japan Medicalnext became the exclusive distributor of our products in Japan. We may continue to sell products through our former exclusive worldwide distributor, Philips Medical Systems Nederland B.V., although our distribution agreement entered into in 2010 has expired.
     Clinical Benefits for Patients
     Although more than 940,000 PCI procedures are performed annually in the U.S., interventionalists continue to face challenges of poorly selected or misplaced stents. Currently, PCI procedures are performed by interventional cardiologists who approximate lesion length using techniques of subjective visual estimation and tactile feel to position the stent. Published data from the Impact of Stent Deployment Procedural Factors on Long-Term Effectiveness and Safety of Sirolimus-Eluting Stents (“STLLR”) trial in 2008, a study designed to specifically examine PCI stent placement accuracy, showed that nearly 50% of coronary stent placements are not accurately positioned within the lesion using this technique. The clinical impact of longitudinal geographic miss includes complications such as re-occlusion that compels repeat intervention. The CorPath System presents a new option to interventional cardiologists with the potential to optimize clinical outcomes by providing enhanced visualization, precise anatomical measurement and improved control for optimal stent positioning. Using the CorPath System, physicians can (i) consistently measure the anatomy with sub-millimeter accuracy, helping them to choose the correct stent for each patient, (ii) move the guidewire straight into the vessel at the proper angle, potentially leading to a shortened procedure for the patient, (iii) view an enhanced, close-up view of the patient’s vessels and arteries for the entire procedure and (iv) hold the guidewire and balloon/stent in place during device deployment, helping to ensure no unintended wire/device movements during the procedure which could adversely affect the patient.
     In addition, robotics can enable increased adoption of transradial access by eliminating the awkward working conditions and increased radiation exposure experienced by the physician. Data has shown that transradial access has significant benefits for patients including reduced incidence of procedural complications including major bleeding and vascular complications, reduced hospitalization, and an improved patient experience. Specifically, left transradial access has additional benefits for certain patients including those who have previously undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and those who are right-hand dominant Studies have demonstrated that combining robotics with transradial access can also increase the precision of stent positioning which may improve patient outcomes.
     Physician Benefits
     The cath lab is a hazardous work environment where interventional cardiologists are exposed to radiation on a daily basis. Physicians face two significant risks in the cath lab: damaging radiation exposure despite the use of heavy lead protective aprons and orthopedic strain due to wearing such protective garments while working in ergonomically compromising positions. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (part of the World Health Organization) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency independently recognize that ionizing radiation, such as x–rays, can cause cancer and have classified such radiation as a “known carcinogen.” The primary method recommended to partially protect oneself from radiation exposure in the cath lab environment entails wearing more than 20 pounds of lead while leaning over a patient’s table, which leads to interventionalist disc disease of the spine as well as knee, hip and neck injuries. Our CorPath System can limit these risks as evidenced by the results from our PRECISE Study, which demonstrated a 95.2% reduction in exposure to radiation obviating the need to wear lead during the procedure.     Hospital Benefits
     Hospitals face increasing pressure to maintain or grow cath lab procedure volumes. By offering a differentiated service, such as robotic-assisted PCI, we can help a facility grow its business. As demonstrated with robotic surgery, hospitals that adopt and promote the technology can benefit in the form of additional patients and procedures.     Target Customers
     The Interventional Cardiologist
     The physician is a key decision maker in the evaluation and adoption of new technologies in the interventional cath lab. There are approximately 5,200 active interventional cardiologists in the United States, according to a 2013 article in the Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions journal, who are estimated to perform in the aggregate more than 940,000 PCI procedures per year. Interventional cardiologists tend to incorporate technology into their practice and are very focused on products that improve patient care and clinical outcomes. Additionally, interventional cardiologists experience unique occupational risk from their work environment, with the largest exposure to radiation of any medical professionals. To offset this risk, interventionalists wear heavy lead protection exposing them to a higher risk of orthopedic injuries and resulting pain.
     The CorPath System allows physicians to measure anatomy with sub-millimeter accuracy and manipulate the interventional device in 1mm increments and with discrete rotational movements. The capability to accurately control and deliver treatment, using a guide catheter, guidewire and stent of their choice, allows physicians to optimize their PCI procedures and potentially provide better clinical outcomes for their patients. Specifically, the robotic precision can potentially minimize longitudinal geographic miss which has been demonstrated in the STLLR trial to correlate to a 2.3 times greater chance of needing to revascularize the target vessel in the first post-procedure year.
     In addition, because physician safety is a growing concern (e.g., studies have shown an increased presence of left-sided brain tumors due to occupational radiation exposure), the ability of the CorPath System to reduce the level of occupational radiation will continue to be a key marketing message. The safety aspect of the device may be a key selling feature as more physicians become employed by healthcare groups which will need to address these concerns to avoid potential workers’ compensation claims and reduce insurance costs. Thus, messaging to physicians will focus on the ability of robotic-assisted PCI to improve procedures that can potentially lead to better clinical outcomes and the protection of physicians from radiation and orthopedic issues.

     The Hospital Administrator
     In this era of economic pressure, purchasing decisions by hospitals must be carefully evaluated to ensure an associated cost benefit. In the case of our products, hospital administrators must be convinced of both the clinical benefit and the economic benefit of having procedures performed using the CorPath System.
     Cath lab patient volume has decreased over the past several years leading to increased competition for patients. Recent data has shown that sites that adopt robotic-assisted surgical procedures, such as prostatectomy, have been able to attract increased patient volumes. Similarly, by using the CorPath System to promote technological leadership in the field of advanced robotics, hospitals can more easily attract and retain physicians while also increasing patient volume.
     Customers purchasing our elective Continuity Support program have access to our valuable CorPath Hospital Marketing Program. This broad-based program is a tool kit designed to assist our customer hospitals in launching their own CorPath Vascular Robotic Program using the CorPath System as a tool to market the hospital’s quality and commitment to patient care and innovation. The tool kit contains both the programmatic and content elements designed to (i) plan, initiate, and execute public relations and outreach campaigns, (ii) influence and change referral patterns to improve market share in the hospital’s catchment area, (iii) promote the benefits of our innovative robotic technology to hospital personnel and patients, and (iv) develop substantial community awareness of the technology and the physicians employing it.
     Significant Customers
     One customer, Japan Medicalnext Co., Ltd., accounted for 20% of revenues in 2017. Three customers, Central Circle Co., Philips and Northwest Texas Healthcare System accounted for 28%, 13%, and 12%, respectively, of revenues in 2016. Three customers, UCSD Medical Center, IA St. Luke’s Medical Center and Edward Heart Hospital accounted for 13%, 11%, and 10% of revenues in 2015.     Competition
     We currently do not face any direct competition for robotic-assisted PCI as the CorPath System is the only FDA-cleared device for this indication. We have some indirect competition in regard to other interventional procedures. There are three companies that make vascular robotic systems for electrophysiology procedures; Hansen Medical, Catheter Precision and Stereotaxis. Hansen Medical, which was acquired by Auris Surgical Robotics in 2016, also has a system used for peripheral vascular procedures. Although Auris Surgical Robotics is not currently marketing or selling this system, they may become a direct competitor for those procedures. Our primary focus today is on converting customers from the traditional manual PCI procedure to the CorPath System PCI procedure.
     The medical device industry, however, is very competitive and subject to significant technological changes. Our potential competitors may develop products, treatments or procedures that are similar, more advanced, safer or more effective than ours. We expect to face competition from many different sources with respect to our existing products and products that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future.
     Seasonality
     Our CorPath System sales and purchase order cycle may typically take from 6 to 15 months due to the capital budgeting cycle and approval process at each hospital. Because it is a capital item, such a purchase generally requires the approval of senior management of hospitals, and sometimes their parent organizations, purchasing groups, and/or government bodies, as applicable. In addition, hospitals may delay or accelerate purchases of the CorPath System in conjunction with timing of their capital budget timelines. As a result, while it is difficult for us to precisely predict the exact timing of CorPath purchases, we believe that our sales may tend to be heaviest during the third month of each fiscal quarter and heavier in the fourth fiscal quarter than in the other quarters.
     Timing of PCI procedures and changes in the PCI procedure market could directly affect the timing of the purchase of our products by hospitals. It is likely that adoption of our products will be more challenging in the third quarter of each year when new interventional fellows join the staff at several of our hospital customer sites. As they are untrained with respect to cath lab skills and patients’ cases, they may be devoted to their manual training techniques rather than use of the CorPath System. In the longer term, this risk should be mediated by the limited number of fellows programs relative to hospitals performing PCI procedures.

     Our Return Policy: One Stent Program
     Neither our equipment, once purchased and installed, nor our single-use cassettes, are returnable or refundable. We stand behind the quality of our products. We value frequent communication with and feedback from our customers in order to continue to improve our offerings and services.
     By minimizing stent utilization, the use of the CorPath System has the potential to bring significant clinical, safety and financial benefits to a hospital. To demonstrate our commitment to the benefits of our robotic CorPath System, we offer our hospitals a unique, stent utilization efficiency program called the CorPath One Stent Program. For each eligible CorPath System procedure in which a second unplanned stent is used, we currently provide a credit to the hospital of $1,000 to be used toward the purchase of additional cassettes. These credits have not been significant to date.
     Raw Materials for Our Products
     We acquire all raw materials for our products from a group of third-party suppliers. These suppliers may be manufacturers of custom components or distributors of commodity, off-the-shelf, components. Whenever possible, secondary sources for the materials are identified and maintained on our Approved Supplier List. To be included on our Approved Supplier List, suppliers must pass the requirements of our documented Supplier Approval Process.
     Availability of and Dependence upon Suppliers
     We own all of the designs of all of the custom components used in our product. This allows us to source components which minimize risk of patent infringement or risk of sale to any other manufacturer. We are able to source components at any supplier that has the technical capability to manufacture them. Some of the items we use are off-the-shelf components which can be sourced on the open market and have very little risk in terms of supply and design change. We continually review our supply base for cost and delivery capacity and make adjustments as necessary.
     Manufacturing of Our Products
     The CorPath System and CorPath Cassettes are manufactured in accordance with the FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“CGMPs”) for medical devices. Our product was initially cleared by the FDA in 2012 for commercial sale using the 510(k) process while our second generation CorPath GRX was cleared in 2016, and our Waltham, Massachusetts facility is registered with the FDA as the place of manufacture for both of these systems.
     With the exception of our cockpit, which is manufactured by an outside source, all of our manufacturing is categorized as light assembly and is performed by trained personnel in our facility. The single-use cassette is manufactured in an International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) Class 8 clean room. This room is monitored, controlled, and operated according to ISO Class 8 and associated FDA guidelines. Finished products are stored in our facility and shipped directly to the customer. No special environmental controls are required for the storage of our product.
     Quality Control for Our Products
     A quality assurance team establishes procedures for process control and tests products at various stages of the manufacturing process to ensure we meet product specifications and that our finished products are manufactured in compliance with FDA Quality System Regulations (“QSR”). We inspect incoming components and finished goods per established procedures. Prior to shipment of the product to customers, the quality assurance team reviews our manufacturing record, to ensure it meets established process control requirements and product specifications.
     Our quality procedures are designed to meet current FDA regulations and ISO 13485 for compliance with CE Mark requirements. Our production requirements are established to meet product specifications cleared by the FDA and ensure safety of the patients and performance expected by the end users. Our quality system is routinely audited by an internal auditor team and annually assessed by BSI Group for Quality Management System (“QMS”) and CE certification. BSI Group is an independent entity, which assesses the compliance of the QMS to ISO 13485 and CE Mark requirements and, upon establishing compliance, provides CE certification (the “Notified Body”).
     Government Regulation
     U.S. Medical Device Regulation
     Our products and operations in the U.S. are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, promotion, marketing, distribution and service of medical devices in the U.S. to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), medical devices are classified into one of three classes (Class I, Class II or Class III), depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of regulatory controls needed to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness. Our current products are Class II medical devices.
     Class II medical devices are those that are subject to general controls and, frequently, additional special controls, such as premarket or specific labeling guidelines, as specified by the FDA. Class II devices also typically require premarket review and clearance by the FDA, which is accomplished through the submission of a 510(k) premarket notification before the device may be marketed in the U.S. As part of the 510(k) notification process, the FDA may require the following:
    
● | Development of comprehensive product description and indications for use.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Completion of extensive preclinical tests and/or preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  11
 



● | Comprehensive review of predicate devices and development of data supporting the new product’s substantial equivalence to one or more predicate devices.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | If appropriate and required, certain types of clinical trials (IDE submission and approval may be required for conducting a clinical trial in the U.S.).

 
Clinical trials involve use of the medical device on human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”) which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. A protocol with predefined end points, an appropriate sample size and pre-determined patient inclusion and exclusion criteria, is required before initiating and conducting clinical trial. The protocol is reviewed and approved by the participating hospital’s Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) before the clinical trial can be initiated at the site. Additionally, the IRB must monitor the study until complete. Any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted and approved by the IRB.
 

● | Assuming successful completion of all required testing, a detailed 510(k) application is submitted to the FDA requesting clearance to market the product. The application includes all relevant data from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s manufacturing controls and proposed labeling, and other relevant documentation. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A 510(k) clearance letter from the FDA will authorize commercial marketing of the device for one or more specific indications for use. 
● | After regulatory clearance, we are required to comply with a number of post-clearance requirements, including, but not limited to, complaint handling and Medical Device Reporting, trending and relevant corrective actions. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to QSR requirements. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with QSRs, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive, and record keeping requirements on medical device manufacturers. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the change, validation activities may need to be performed. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with QSRs and types of regulatory controls.

 
While not anticipated, future FDA inspections and Notified Body (in the EU) audits may identify compliance issues at our facilities that may potentially disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a device or failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on manufacturing and distribution of the device, including withdrawal/recall of the device from the market, or FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly identified safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and/or contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures.
 
After a device receives FDA 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a premarket approval application (“PMA”). The FDA requires each manufacturer to make the determination of whether a modification requires a new 501(k) notification or PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA for a particular change, the FDA may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA. The FDA can also require the manufacturer to cease U.S. marketing and/or recall the modified device until additional 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.
 
The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) also regulate the advertising claims of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims and that our advertising is neither false nor misleading. In general, we may not promote or advertise our products for uses not within the scope of our intended use statement in our clearances or make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims. Many regulatory jurisdictions outside of the U.S. have similar regulations to which we would be subject. Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the FDA’s cGMP requirements contained in its QSR and associated regulations and guidance. The QSR covers, among other things, the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping, installation and service of a company’s products. The QSR also requires maintenance of extensive records which demonstrate compliance with FDA regulation, the manufacturer’s own procedures, specifications and testing as well as distribution and post-market experience. Compliance with the QSR is necessary to receive FDA clearance or approval to market new products and is necessary for a manufacturer to be able to continue to market cleared or approved product offerings in the U.S. A company’s facilities, records, and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA, which may issue reports known as Forms FDA 483 or Notices of Inspectional Observations which list instances where the FDA inspector believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures. If the observations are sufficiently serious or the manufacturer fails to respond appropriately, the FDA may issue Warning Letters, which are notices of intended enforcement actions against the manufacturer; or Untitled Letters, which are used for less serious violations that may not rise to the level of regulatory significance. These enforcement actions could include legal actions, including fines and total shutdown of production facilities, seizure of product, prohibition on export or import and criminal prosecution. Such actions may have further indirect consequences for the manufacturer outside of the U.S., and may adversely affect the reputation of the manufacturer and the product. In the U.S., routine FDA inspections usually occur every two years, and may occur more often for cause.
 
We intend to submit 510(k) applications for our next generation devices and for any new indications for use of our existing products. The applications may rely upon published literature and/or the findings of safety and effectiveness based on pre-clinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved or cleared product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product or for new claims for the cleared product.
 
Foreign Medical Device Regulation
 
In order for us to market our products in other countries, we must comply with extensive safety and quality regulations in other countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals, clearance or grant of CE Certificates and Declaration of Conformity and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Failure to obtain regulatory approval, clearance or CE Certificates of Conformity (or equivalent) in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products, including obtaining PMDA approval in Japan, may harm our ability to generate revenue and harm our business.

The primary regulatory environment in Europe is that of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union (“EU”), Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. In the EEA, our devices are required to comply with the Essential Requirements defined in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive (applicable in the non-EU EEA Member States via the Agreement on the European Economic Area). We are also required to ensure compliance with the relevant quality system requirements defined in the Annexes to the Medical Devices Directive. Compliance with these requirements entitles us to affix the CE mark to our medical devices, without which they cannot be commercialized in EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements defined in Annex I of the Medical Devices Directive to obtain the right to affix the CE mark to our medical devices, and thus be permitted to market our medical devices on the EEA market, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. With the exception of low risk medical devices (Class I devices with no measuring function and which are not sterile), in relation to which the manufacturer may issue a CE Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements defined in the Medical Devices Directive, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of an EU accredited organization. This is an organization designated by the competent authorities of an EEA country to conduct conformity assessments. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the accredited organization may audit and examine products’ Technical File and/or the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices before issuing a CE Certificate of Conformity. This Certificate demonstrates substantive compliance with the relevant Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I of the Medical Devices Directive or the relevant quality system requirements defined in the Annexes to the Directive and constitutes the basis for manufacturers to issue their mandatory Declaration of Conformity. Companies compliant with ISO requirements such as “EN ISO 13485: 2012 Medical devices — Quality management systems — Requirements for regulatory purposes” benefit from a presumption of conformity with the relevant quality system requirements defined in the Annexes to the Medical Devices Directive. The Notified Body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the Essential Requirements and quality system requirements. In 2016, we received CE Certificate of Conformity from our Notified Body permitting us to affix the CE mark and market our CorPath GRX System in the EEA. If we modify existing products or develop new products in the future, including new devices, it may be necessary to notify our Notified Body and go through a conformity assessment procedure before having the right to affix the CE mark to such products. We will be subject to regulatory audits, currently conducted annually, in order to maintain any CE Certificates of Conformity that have been issued by our Notified Body. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain CE Certificates of Conformity for new or modified products. We continually strive to maintain our quality system to comply with the regulatory requirements defined in the Medical Device Directive and EN ISO 13485 for the CE Certificate of Conformity that we have received. We will evaluate regulatory approval in other foreign countries on an opportunistic basis.
 
Third Party Coverage and Reimbursement
 
The U.S. government and health insurance companies together are responsible for hospital and physician reimbursement for virtually all covered interventional procedures. Governments and insurance companies generally reimburse hospitals and physicians for procedures considered medically necessary. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs (the latter, along with applicable state governments). Many other third-party payors model their reimbursement methodologies after the Medicare program. As the single largest payor, this program has a significant impact on other payors’ payment systems.
 
Generally, reimbursement for professional services performed at a facility by physicians is reported under billing codes issued by the American Medical Association (“AMA”), known as Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) codes. Physician reimbursement under Medicare generally is based on a fee schedule and determined by the relative values of the professional service rendered. In addition, CMS and the National Center for Health Statistics (“NCHS”) are jointly responsible for overseeing changes and modifications to billing codes known as ICD-9-CM procedural codes used by hospitals to report inpatient procedures. For Medicare, CMS generally reimburses hospitals for services provided during an inpatient stay based on a prospective payment system that is determined by a classification system known as Medicare-Severity Diagnostic Related Groupings (“MS-DRGs”). MS-DRGs are assigned using a number of factors including the principal diagnosis, major procedures, discharged status, patient age and complicating secondary diagnoses among other things. Hospital outpatient services, reported by CPT codes, are assigned to clinically relevant Ambulatory Payment Classifications (“APCs”) used to determine the payment amount for services provided.
 
On October 1, 2008, CMS and NCHS issued a new family of ICD-9-CM procedure codes for “Robotically Assisted Procedures.” The purpose of the ICD-9-CM family of procedure codes is to gather data on robotic assisted surgical procedures. Effective October 1, 2014, ICD-9-CM procedure code 1743 was implemented for Percutaneous Robotic Assisted Procedure(s). A surgical procedure, completed with or without robotic assistance, continues to be assigned to the clinically relevant MS-DRG.
 
Governments and insurance companies carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for medical products and surgical services. Reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending on the procedure performed, the third-party payor, contract terms, and other factors. Because both hospitals and physicians may receive the same reimbursement for their respective services, with or without robotics, regardless of actual costs incurred by the hospital or physician in furnishing the care, including for the specific products used in that procedure, hospitals and physicians may decide not to use our products if reimbursement amounts are insufficient to cover any additional costs incurred when purchasing our products.
 
Domestic institutions typically bill for the primary procedure that includes our products to various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs and private insurance plans. Because our CorPath System has been cleared for commercial distribution in the U.S. by the FDA, coverage and reimbursement by payors are generally determined by the medical necessity of the primary procedure. While PCI procedures are typically reimbursed by third-party payors, currently, there is no incremental reimbursement provided for robotic-assisted PCI. Therefore, using the CorPath System and consumable cassettes without an incremental reimbursement will initially increase the up-front cost of the PCI procedure and the cath lab operation based on the cost of the CorPath System and also consumable cassettes. This lack of incremental reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures performed with our products, or lack of coverage by governmental and private payors’ policies of interventional procedures performed using our products, may make us unable to generate the revenues necessary to support our business.
 
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, “the PPACA”), was signed into law and makes changes significantly impacting healthcare providers, insurers, pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. One of the principal aims of the PPACA is to expand health insurance coverage to any Americans who are currently uninsured. The PPACA contains a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund this coverage expansion, including, but not limited to new fees or taxes on certain health-related industries, including medical device manufacturers. Beginning in 2013, medical device manufacturers are required to pay an excise tax (or sales tax) of 2.3% on certain U.S. medical device revenues. Under this provision, we have incurred an excise tax of approximately $104,000 cumulatively through December 31, 2015 which is reflected in our operating expenses. The excise tax was suspended for two years due to the operation of a provision in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, signed into law on December 18, 2015, but that two-year suspension period ended on December 31, 2017. In mid-January 2018, with the signing of P.L. 115-120, suspension of the medical device excise tax was extended for an additional two years ending on December 31, 2019 and made retroactive to January 1, 2018. At the present time, there is no guarantee that the excise tax will continue to be suspended by congressional action after this suspension ends, or that any provisions of the PPACA will continue to exist in their current form. Certain legislators are continuing their efforts to repeal the PPACA, although there is little clarity on how such a repeal would be implemented and what a PPACA replacement might look like. For the immediate future, there continues to be significant uncertainty regarding the health care, health care coverage and health care insurance markets.

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, creates the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers.
 
Any regulatory or legislative developments in domestic markets that eliminate or reduce reimbursement rates for procedures performed using our products could harm our ability to sell our products or cause downward pressure on the prices of our products, either of which would affect our ability to generate the revenues necessary to support our business.
