ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
GENERAL
 
 Powin Energy Corporation (“Company”, “we”, “us”) is a leading producer, designer and developer of commercially proven, cost-competitive, safe and scalable lithium-ion based energy storage solutions for utilities and microgrid. Our primary product is the Stack140 (“Stack”), a modular, flexible, purpose-built battery string that is easily and cost-effectively scalable from a single unit to multiple megawatts of capacity. Over the past 8 years we applied our competitive advantages to the nascent energy storage sector and are currently among the market leaders in providing utility-scale, turnkey battery energy storage solutions. 

 The Company was founded in 1989 in Oregon and until 2016, operated as a contract manufacturer selling diverse products for leading North American retailers. In 2016, the Company sold off its contract manufacturing businesses to become a pure-play stationary energy storage company, and on October 6, 2016, completed a merger between Powin Corporation and its subsidiary Powin Energy Corporation, with the surviving entity Powin Corporation changing its name to Powin Energy Corporation. The Company is focused on the rapidly growing advanced energy storage industry, supported by its cutting edge and patented technology.
 
Competition
 
The international market for such energy products and services is intensely competitive and continually impacted by evolving industry standards, international and regional governmental regulations, rapid price changes and product obsolescence. Competitors in this market include several domestic and foreign companies, most of which have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, manufacturing and other resources.  We believe that the Company currently presents a unique perspective in taking advantage of the value chain in battery energy storage compared to much of the competitive landscape.  While we are and will likely continue to be at a competitive disadvantage to most of our competitors in regard to company financial strength, we believe though patented technology and sophisticated procurement channels we will continue to produce a high-quality competitively priced product across multiple energy industry segments.
